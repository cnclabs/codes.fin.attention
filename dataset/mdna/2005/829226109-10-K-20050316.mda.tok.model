item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a diversified television broadcasting company that owns or provides certain programming  operating or sales services to more television stations than any other commercial broadcasting group in the united states 
we currently own  provide programming and operating services pursuant to local marketing agreements lmas or provide or are provided sales services pursuant to outsourcing agreements to television stations in markets 
we currently have duopoly markets where we own and operate two stations within the same market 
we have eight lma markets where  with one exception  we own and operate one station in the market and provide programming and operating services to by another station within that market 
in the remaining sixteen markets  we own and operate a single television station 
we believe that owning duopolies enables us to accomplish two very important strategic business objectives increasing our share of revenues available in each market and operating television stations more efficiently by minimizing costs 
we constantly monitor revenue share and cost efficiencies and we aggressively pursue opportunities to improve both using new technology and by sharing best practices among our station groups 
most of our revenues are generated from the transactional spot market rather than the traditional up front and scatter markets that some of our competitors can access 
these operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  from political advertisers and television network compensation 
our revenues from local advertisers have continued to trend upward and revenues from national advertisers have continued to trend downward when measured as a percentage of gross broadcast revenue 
we believe this trend is the result of our focus on increasing local advertising revenues as a percentage of total advertising revenues  from a decrease in overall spending by national advertisers and from an increase in the number of competitive media outlets providing national advertisers a means by which to advertise their goods or services 
our efforts to mitigate the effect of these increasing competitive media outlets for national advertisers include continuing our efforts to increase local revenues and developing innovative sales and marketing strategies to sell traditional and non traditional services to our advertisers 
our primary operating expenses are syndicated program rights fees  commissions on revenues  employee salaries  news gathering and station promotional costs 
amortization and depreciation of costs other than goodwill associated with the acquisition of our stations and interest carrying charges are significant factors in determining our overall profitability 
sinclair television group  inc stg is a wholly owned subsidiary of sinclair broadcast group  inc sbg that we created in as part of our redemption of our hytops  on september   we completed the creation of a modified holding company structure  whereby we transferred substantially all of our television broadcast assets and liabilities to stg 
as such  stg has become the primary obligor under our existing bank credit agreement  the senior subordinated notes due and the senior subordinated notes due our class a common stock  class b common stock  series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock and the convertible senior subordinated notes remain obligations or securities of sbg and are not obligations or securities of stg 
on november   we announced the sale of ksmo tv in kansas city  missouri  to meredith corporation for million  of which we have closed on million for the non license assets 
until the federal communications commission fcc approves the transfer of the fcc license  we will continue our involvement in certain operations of this station through an outsourcing agreement with meredith 
on december   we announced the sale of kovr tv in sacramento  california  to cbs broadcasting  inc for million 
closing will occur if and when the fcc approves this transaction 
we expect both transactions to close in and we have reclassified the operations of these stations as discontinued operations and the assets and liabilities as held for sale in our financial statements in accordance with all applicable accounting rules and principles 
see note discontinued operations in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial position  results of operations and cash flows are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  program contract costs  intangible assets  income taxes  property and equipment  investments and derivative contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates have been consistently applied for all years presented in this report and  in the past we have not experienced material differences between these estimates and actual results 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our estimates  and such differences could be material 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from extending credit to our customers that are unable to make required payments 
if the economy and or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make their payments  additional allowances may be required 
for example  a increase of the balance of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december   would have affected net income available to common shareholders by approximately million 
program contract costs 
we have agreements with distributors for the rights to television programming over contract periods  which generally run from one to seven years 
contract payments are made in installments over terms that are generally equal to or shorter than the contract period 
each contract is recorded as an asset and a liability at an amount equal to its gross cash contractual commitment when the license period begins and the program is available for its first showing 
the portion of program contracts which become payable within one year is reflected as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
the programming rights are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value nrv 
estimated nrvs are based upon management s expectation of future advertising revenues  net of sales commissions  to be generated by the remaining program material 
amortization of program contract costs is generally computed using either a four year accelerated method or straight line method  depending upon the length of the contract 
program contract costs estimated by management to be amortized within one year are classified as current assets 
payments of program contract liabilities are typically paid on a scheduled basis and are not affected by adjustments for amortization or estimated nrv 
if our estimate of future advertising revenues declines  then additional write downs to nrv may be required 
valuation of goodwill  long lived assets and intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill  broadcast licenses  long lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows  market conditions  operating performance of our stations and legal factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the net book value of long lived assets and intangible assets is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we have determined our broadcast licenses to be indefinite lived intangible assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires such assets to be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
we test our broadcast licenses by estimating the fair market value of each fcc license using a discounted cash flow model 
we then compare the estimated fair market value to the book value of each of our fcc licenses to determine if an impairment exists 
our discounted cash flow model is based on our judgment of future market conditions within the designated marketing area of each broadcast license as well as discount rates that would be used by market participants in an arms length transaction 
future events could cause us to conclude that market conditions have declined or discount rates have increased to the extent that our broadcast licenses could be impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets relating to various federal and state net operating losses nol being carried forward based on the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary book tax basis differences  alternative tax strategies and projected future taxable income 
although realization is not assured for the remaining deferred tax assets  we believe that it is more likely than not that they will be realized in the future 
if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income  if there is a material change in our projected future taxable income or if there is a change in our ability to utilize the nol carryforwards due to changes in federal and state laws  we will make any necessary adjustments to the valuation allowance 
this may result in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
management periodically performs a comprehensive review of our tax positions and accrues amounts for tax contingencies 
based on these reviews  the status of ongoing audits and the expiration of applicable statute of limitations  accruals are adjusted as necessary 
the resolution of audits is unpredictable and could result in tax liabilities that are significantly higher or lower than that which has been provided by us 
set forth below are the principal types of broadcast revenues from continuing operations received by our stations for the periods indicated and the percentage contribution of each type to our total gross broadcast revenues broadcast revenues in thousands years ended december  local regional advertising national advertising network compensation political advertising production other station revenues broadcast revenues less agency commissions net broadcast revenues revenues realized from station barter arrangements other operating divisions revenues total revenues our primary types of programming and their approximate percentages of net broadcast revenues from continuing operations were syndicated programming  network programming  news  direct advertising programming  sports programming  children s programming and other programming 
similarly  our five largest categories of advertising and their approximate percentages of net broadcast revenues were automotive  professional services  paid programming including religious programming  fast food and retail department stores 
other than political advertising  no other advertising category accounted for more than of our broadcast revenues in along with the industry  we have seen softness in the auto advertising category and we expect this to continue in no individual advertiser accounted for more than of our consolidated net broadcast revenues in the following table sets forth certain of our operating data from continuing operations for the years ended december   and for definitions of items  see the footnotes to the table in item selected financial data

record levels of political advertising spending at our stations was the primary driver of our revenues in political revenues were higher than the previous election year in and were higher than the previous presidential election year in our local advertising revenues  excluding political advertising  have remained stable and we attribute this primarily to our new business initiatives 
meanwhile  automotive spending  our largest advertising category  was soft in the second half of due to the drop in spending  commercial production and consumer incentive programs by the automotive manufacturers 
our results also include increased expenses reflecting continued expansion of our news central operations and implementation of our new business initiatives 
as part of our direct mail initiative  we increased the number of mailings during the year  thereby increasing our printing and postage costs 
we believe that through these efforts  we are now able to maximize the benefit of offering our advertisers direct mailings along with traditional television spots 
in  we plan to monitor the number and size of our mailings and adjust them to achieve efficient levels of market penetration and saturation 
during the fourth quarter  we entered into agreements to dispose of our television stations in sacramento  california and kansas city  missouri for prices higher than current public valuations 
we will continue to have involvement in certain operations of both stations until the federal communications commission approves the transfer of the broadcast licenses to the respective buyers 
beginning in the second quarter of  we declared quarterly dividends of per share on our common stock and in february of  we announced an increase to per share 
unless otherwise indicated  references in this discussion and analysis to   and are to our fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
additionally  references to the first  second  third or fourth quarter are to the three months ended march  june  september and december  respectively  for the year being discussed 
operating results the following table presents our revenues from continuing operations  net of agency commissions  for the past three years in millions percent change vs 
vs 
local revenues non political political total local national revenues non political political total national other revenues total broadcasting revenues political revenues both local and national political revenues were the primary drivers of our revenues in when comparing political revenues to  the most recent election year  local and national political revenues were up and  respectively 
we attribute this increase to the fact that we have stations in nine of the so called battleground states  including five stations in ohio and multiple stations in each of florida  iowa  missouri and wisconsin 
we do not expect political revenues to be significant in local revenues our revenues from local advertisers  excluding political revenues remain stable 
we continue to focus on increasing local advertising revenues through innovative sales and marketing strategies in our markets 
revenues from our business initiatives increased to million in from million in we are not able to compare these amounts to because there was no comparable direct mail program in that year 
additionally  during we implemented an enhanced sales training course for all of our salespeople with a focus on local revenue sales 
we expect that these efforts will enable us to continue the upward trend of local revenues  excluding political sales  in national revenues our revenues from national advertisers  excluding political revenues  have continued to trend downward over time 
we believe this trend represents a significant shift in the way national advertising dollars are being spent 
we are seeing a shift by the national advertisers towards spending more resources during our network programming hours and away from other times during the day where we have more inventory available for sale 
other operating divisions revenue and expense during  the other operating divisions revenue that related to g  our software development and consulting company  increased by million to million or from revenues of million in g s operating expenses increased to million for as compared to million for the same period last year 
the growth of g s it staffing and builder divisions largely contributed to the increase in revenues in likewise  expenses rose as a result of the increase in resources and expenses to run these divisions 
other operating divisions revenue related to our ownership interest in acrodyne decreased by million to million or from revenues of million in acrodyne s operating expenses decreased million to million for as compared to million for the same period last year 
acrodyne did not receive the commitments for new transmitters that it expected during staffing was reduced as a result of the decreased sales 
however  commitments for new transmitters with expected sales of approximately million were received in the beginning of for shipment during the first half of the year 
during  the g operating divisions revenue that related to software development and consulting increased by million to million  or  from million for the same period last year 
other operating divisions revenue related to our interest in acrodyne increased by million because beginning january   we commenced consolidating the financial statements of acrodyne and discontinued accounting for the investment under the equity method of accounting 
other operating divisions expenses increased by million  of which million resulted from the consolidation of acrodyne  offset by a decrease in general and administrative costs of million for g  primarily related to the consolidation from three offices to one office and continued focus on cost reduction  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the following table presents our time sales revenue from continuing operations  net of agency commissions  by network affiliates for the past three years in millions of percent of sales net time sales percent change stations vs

in  the increase from in station production costs was primarily related to an increase in promotion costs of million during the february ratings sweeps compared to february  when we reduced our spending due to direct competition from the olympics 
we also experienced increases in spending of million for the commencement of news central in our greensboro  milwaukee  tampa  birmingham  las vegas and cincinnati markets 
rating service fees of million related to new contracts for eleven stations  programming costs of million  engineering costs of million related to news expansions in the fourth quarter  the full year effect of the addition of our wnab tv outsourcing agreement during the second quarter of and increased electricity costs related to digital tv 
these increases were offset by a decrease in costs of million related to our outsourcing and lma agreements  a decrease in music license fees of million  production expenses of million and other miscellaneous decreases of million 
we will continue to assess profitable opportunities for our news expansion 
station selling  general and administrative expenses in  we had an increase in sales and other expense related to our direct mail initiative of million  an increase in bad debt expense of million  an increase in vacation  salary and payroll taxes of million  an increase in local sales commissions of million  an increase in national commissions of million related to increased revenue during  an increase in insurance costs of million  an increase in trade expense of million  an increase in building rent and related expenses of million and miscellaneous increases of million compared to during  we experienced increases in direct mail marketing campaign costs of million  sales expenses for the addition of our wnab tv outsourcing agreement of million  an increase in sales compensation costs of million  legal fees of million and miscellaneous general and administrative costs of million when compared to the prior corresponding period 
these increases were offset by a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses related to a reduction of million in bad debt expense as a result of improvements in the economy  national commissions of million  expenses for cunningham of million  trade expense of million  property taxes of million and vacation expense of million 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses are comprised of three components depreciation of property and equipment  amortization of program contract costs and amortization of definite lived intangible assets 
depreciation of property and equipment the depreciation of property and equipment was million in  million in and million in this expense is increasing over time because of the significant amount of capital expenditures we have incurred for digital equipment and for our news central operations 
we expect to incur an additional million in capital expenditures during and we expect depreciation expense to increase to approximately million in amortization of program contract costs the amortization of program contract costs was million in  million in and million in the decrease in amortization expense over time is primarily because in each of the last three years we have spent less for program additions than we had in the year before 
we expect amortization of program contracts to decrease to approximately million in amortization of definite lived intangible assets the amortization of definite lived intangibles was million in  million in and million in this expense is decreasing only slightly over time as a result of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized each year 
we do not expect any changes in the intangible balance in the near future and we expect amortization of definite lived intangibles to decrease slightly to approximately million in corporate general and administrative expenses corporate general and administrative expenses represent the cost to operate our corporate headquarters location 
such costs include  among other things  corporate departmental salaries  bonuses and fringe benefits  officers life insurance  rent  telephone  consulting fees  legal  accounting  and director fees 
corporate departments include executive  treasury  finance and accounting  human resources  technology  corporate relations  legal  sales  operations and purchasing 
in  there was an increase of million from  due primarily to increase of salary expense of million  and increase in training and education costs of million  an increase in corporation relation costs of million  an increase in expense of million related to compliance with sarbanes oxley and an increase in legal fees of million 
these were offset by decreases in consulting fees of million and other miscellaneous decreases of million 
in  the increase in corporate general and administrative expenses primarily related to an increase of consulting fees of million  increased costs for telecommunications related to upgrades of million  and insurance costs of million  offset by other miscellaneous decreases in expense of million 
interest expense interest expense is comprised of three components interest expense  amortization of certain debt financing costs and subsidiary trust minority interest expense 
interest expense presented in the financial statements is related to continuing operations  with a portion of interest expense being allocated to discontinued operations in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
see note discontinued operations  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
interest expense interest expense decreased slightly in by million as a result of the refinancing we did in the second quarter in an effort to reduce our overall interest costs 
interest expense increased in by million as a result of the redemption of hytops in june of that year 
this increase was offset by refinancings in the second quarter of assuming no changes in the interest rate yield curve  no changes in debt levels and the sale of our sacramento  california station in the second quarter of  we expect interest expense to decrease to approximately million next year 
amortization of certain debt financing costs amortization of certain debt financing costs decreased slightly in by million and decreased significantly in by million 
the decrease in includes reduced amortization of million related to the hytops that were redeemed in  offset by a full year of amortization of million related to the convertible notes 
the decrease in includes reduced amortization of million related to the notes that were redeemed in december of along with a partial year of amortization of million related to the hytops that were redeemed in  offset by the a partial year of amortization of million related to the convertible notes 
assuming no changes to our existing debt structure  we expect these cost to remain stable in subsidiary trust minority interest in june of  we refinanced our hytops with long term debt so that we no longer incurred subsidiary trust minority interest 
as a result  the interest expense was approximately one half of the expense and there was no associated interest expense in we do not expect to enter into a similar financing instrument in derivative instruments we record gains and losses related to certain of our derivative instruments 
these instruments were entered into by us prior to implementing fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and due to the way they were structured  they did not qualify as effective hedges as that term is defined in the accounting guidance 
generally  when derivative instruments are not effective  the change in the fair value of the instruments is recorded in the statement of earnings for each respective period 
the fair value of our derivative instruments is primarily based on the future interest rate curves at the end of each period 
in and  when the future interest rate curves reflected increasing interest rates  we recorded unrealized gain from derivative instruments in our statements of operations 
similarly  in  when the future interest rate curves reflected decreasing interest rates  we recorded an unrealized loss from derivative instruments 
currently  assuming we do not terminate these derivative instruments before expiration  the maximum aggregate unrealized gain from derivative instruments that we will record in all future periods is million which equals the fair value of the obligation related to these instruments as of december  
since we cannot predict how the interest rate curves will change in the future  we are not able to predict the impact our derivative instruments will have on earnings in and future periods 
gain on insurance settlement in the first quarter of  one of our towers in charleston  west virginia collapsed during a severe ice storm 
this tower was insured and we used the insurance proceeds to rebuild the tower and to replace the other assets that were destroyed by the collapse 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed substantially all of the construction of the new tower and placed it in service  and at that time we recognized a gain on insurance settlement of million 
of this amount  million was related to business interruption insurance recoveries 
we expect to receive an additional million of insurance proceeds in related to the completion of the tower and related assets and we will recognize that as income when the cash is received 
impairment of goodwill on a periodic basis  we test our goodwill for impairment in accordance with the applicable accounting rules 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
when we performed this test in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the goodwill in one of our markets was impaired 
we recognized a loss of million in the fourth quarter related to this impairment 
we will continue to test our goodwill on a periodic basis and  if required  we will record additional goodwill impairments in the future 
income tax provision the income tax provision from continuing operations increased to million for the year ended december   from the income tax provision of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our pre tax book income from continuing operations was million and for the year ended december   our pre tax book income from continuing operations was million 
the effective tax rate from continuing operations was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our tax rate changed to a provision in  from a benefit in because we reported pre tax book income in  compared to a pre tax book loss in we believe that the effective tax rate will be in as of december   we have a net deferred tax liability of million as compared to a net deferred tax liability of million as of december  the increase in deferred taxes primarily relates to deferred tax liabilities associated with book and tax differences relating to the amortization  depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and fixed assets  offset by deferred tax assets resulting from federal and state net operating losses nols generated during recent accounting pronouncements in september  the emerging issues task force eitf finalized eitf no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share eitf 
issue requires all issued securities that have embedded market price contingent conversion features be included in the diluted earnings per share diluted eps calculation  if dilutive 
we adopted eitf for our diluted eps calculation on december  our convertible senior subordinated notes due were not included in our diluted eps calculation for december  and because the effect was antidilutive 
the convertible senior subordinated notes due were issued during may and were not available to be included in our december  diluted eps calculation 
see note earnings per share  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r as a revision to fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
this standard requires that all share based payments  including grants of employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan  be recognized in the income statement as compensation expense based on their fair values 
sfas r is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after june  we expect to adopt sfas r on july statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date  and a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma information related to stock based compensation below note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and availability under our bank credit agreement 
our bank credit agreement consists of a million revolving credit facility maturing on june   a million term loan a facility and a million term loan c facility 
on june   we amended and restated our bank credit agreement  lowering our annual interest rate 
as part of the amendment  we fully redeemed our million term loan b facility with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and with new lower priced  million term loan a and million term loan c facilities 
we did not make any changes to the terms of the revolving credit facility 
the term loan a facility is repayable in quarterly installments  amortizing as follows per quarter commencing march  to march   and per quarter commencing march  and continuing through its maturity on june  the term loan c facility is repayable in quarterly installments  amortizing  commencing march  through its maturity on december  the applicable interest rate on the revolving credit facility is either london interbank offered rate libor plus to or the alternative base rate plus to adjusted quarterly based on the ratio of total debt  net of cash  to four quarters trailing earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as adjusted in accordance with the bank credit agreement 
commitments under the revolving credit facility do not reduce incrementally and terminates at maturity 
we are required to prepay the term loan facilities and reduce the revolving credit facility with i of the net proceeds of any casualty loss or condemnation and  ii of the net proceeds of any sale or other disposition of our assets in excess of million in the aggregate for any fiscal year  to the extent not used to acquire new assets 
the applicable interest rate on the term loan a facility is libor plus with step downs tied to a leverage grid 
the applicable interest rate on the term loan c facility is libor plus 
as a result of amending the bank credit agreement  we incurred debt acquisition costs of million and recognized a loss of million  which includes cash payments related to extinguishment of debt of million and a write off of deferred financing fees of million 
the loss represents the write off of certain debt acquisition costs associated with indebtedness replaced by the new term loan facilities 
the loss was computed in accordance with eitf no 
 debtors accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments 
as of december   we had million in cash balances and working capital of approximately million 
we anticipate that cash flow from our operations and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our debt service obligations  dividend requirements  capital expenditure requirements and working capital needs for the next year 
as of december   we had fully redeemed our million term loan b facility  borrowed million on our term loan a and term loan c facilities and had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the remaining balance available under the revolving credit facility was million as of december  and we had approximately million of current borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility for the period ended december  our ability to draw down our revolving credit facility is based on pro forma trailing cash flow levels as defined in our bank credit agreement 
on april   we filed a million universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission which will permit us to offer and sell various types of securities from time to time 
offered securities may include common stock  debt securities  preferred stock  depositary shares or any combination thereof in amounts  prices and on terms to be announced when the securities are offered 
as a result of the late filing of form k in august  we are ineligible to register for securities on form s until august in addition  upon the filing of this form k  we will become ineligible to issue securities under our currently effective shelf registration statement until august after august  if we decide to offer any such securities  we intend to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes  including  but not limited to  the reduction  redemption or refinancing of debt or other obligations  acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital

we hold two interest rate swap agreements that have notional amounts totaling million that expire on june  on december   the interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million contained a european style that is  exercisable only on the expiration date termination option and could be terminated partially or in full by the counterparty on june  at its fair market value 
this instrument was amended march   resulting in removal of the termination option by the counterparty 
the interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million does not have an option to terminate before it expires 
we estimate the fair market value of the million and million agreements at december  to be million and million  respectively  based on quotations from the counterparty 
these amounts are reflected as a component of other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  net cash flows from operating activities decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we paid income tax  net of refunds  of million for the year ended december  as compared to receiving income tax refunds  net of payments  of million for the year ended december  interest payments on outstanding indebtedness increased million to million from million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  we made no payments related to our hytops for the year ended december  as compared to payments of million for the year ended december  the hytops were redeemed on june  through the issuance of indebtedness with lower interest rates 
program rights payments increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  or 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash flows used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash flows used in investing activities resulted from a decrease in cash payments for property and equipment of million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the cash payments for property and equipment during included million related to digital conversion costs and million related to implementation of our news central format 
the cash payments for property during included million related to digital conversion costs and million related to implementation of our news central format 
during the year ended december   we received proceeds of million for the sale of our non license assets of ksmo tv in kansas city and million for the close on the option to purchase the license assets of ketk tv in tyler  texas 
we made an million cash deposit related to a future acquisition of broadcast assets during the year ended december  there was no similar activity for the year ended december  during the years ended december  and  we received proceeds of million and million  respectively  from the insurance settlement related to the destruction of our tower for wvah tv in charleston  west virginia  during a severe ice storm in during the years ended december  and  we made cash payments of million and million  respectively  for the purchase of equity and cost investments 
we funded these investing activities using cash provided by operating activities 
for  we anticipate incurring approximately million of capital expenditures for station maintenance and equipment replacement and to consolidate building and tower needs in some markets 
in addition  we anticipate that future requirements for expenditures will include expenditures incurred during the ordinary course of business and additional strategic station acquisitions and equity investments if suitable investments can be identified on acceptable terms 
we expect to fund such capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities and funding from our revolving credit facility or an issuance of securities 
net cash flows used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash flows used in financing activities of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we repaid a net million of indebtedness  whereas in the comparable period in  we repaid a net of million of indebtedness including redemption of million aggregate principal amount of the hytops 
we repurchased million and million of our class a common stock for the year ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   we repurchased million of our series d preferred stock 
we received proceeds from exercise of stock options of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we incurred deferred financing costs of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on october   we announced a share repurchase program 
under this program  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million worth of our class a common stock 
there is no expiration date for this program and currently  management has no plans to terminate this program 
on june   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of our series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock 
this program was not publicly announced  no minimum or maximum dollar amounts were established by the board and there is no expiration date for this program 
currently  management has no plans to terminate this program 
we entered into an agreement to sell our television station kovr tv in sacramento for million on december  and expect to close in we expect to use the after tax proceeds to repay our long term debt 
preferred stock 
for the year ended december  and  we paid quarterly dividends of million and million on our series d preferred stock  respectively 
we expect to incur these dividend payments in each of our future quarters and expect to fund these dividends with cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our bank credit agreement 
common stock 
in may  we declared a quarterly cash dividend on our class a common stock for the first time in our company s history 
the dividend of per share was paid as shown below for the quarter ended total amount dividends paid date dividends were paid june  million july  september  million october  december  million january  in february  the board of directors increased the annual per share dividend paid on the class a and class b common shares from to per share 
we expect to continue to pay the current dividend rate of in each of our future quarters and to fund these dividends with cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our bank credit agreement 
seasonality cyclicality our operating results are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations 
usually  the fourth quarter operating results are higher than the other three quarters primarily because advertising expenditures are increased in anticipation of holiday season spending by consumers 
usually  the second quarter operating results are higher than the first and third quarters primarily because advertising expenditures are increased in anticipation of consumer spending on summer related items such as home improvements  lawn care and travel plans 
our operating results are usually subject to fluctuations from political advertising 
in even years  political spending is significantly higher than in odd years due to advertising expenditures surrounding local and national elections 
additionally  in every four years  political spending is elevated further due to advertising expenditures surrounding the presidential election 
indebtedness and other commitments indebtedness under the bank credit agreement  as amended 
as of december   we owed million under the bank credit agreement  as amended and had a million available balance of which million of current borrowing capacity was available 
indebtedness under notes 
we have issued and outstanding two series of senior subordinated notes and one series of senior convertible notes with aggregate principal amount issued and outstanding of billion 
series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock 
we have issued  shares of series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately million 
the liquidation preference means we would be required to pay the holders of series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock million before we paid holders of common stock or any other stock that is junior to the series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock in any liquidation of sinclair 
we are not obligated to buy back or retire the series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock  but may do so at our option at a conversion rate of per share 
in some circumstances  we may also exchange the series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock for subordinated debentures due with an aggregate principal amount of million 
program contracts payable and programming commitments 
total current and long term program contracts payable at december  were million and million  respectively 
in addition  we enter into commitments to purchase future programming 
under these commitments  we were obligated on december  to make future payments totaling million 
other 
our commitments also include capital leases  operating leases  sports programming  personnel contracts and other liabilities 
the amount of these commitments may be material 
contractual cash obligations we have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed 
for example  we are contractually committed to acquire future programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 
the following tables reflect a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of december  and the future periods in which such arrangements are expected to be settled in cash in thousands contractual cash obligatoins related to continuing operations total and thereafter notes payable  capital leases and commercial bank financing a notes and capital leases payable to affiliates fixed rate derivative instrument operating leases employment contracts film liability active film liability future b programming services maintenance and support network affiliation agreements other operating contracts total contractual cash obligations contractual cash obligations related to discontinued operations total and thereafter notes payable  capital leases and commercial bank financing a operating leases employment contracts film liability active film liability future b programming services maintenance and support other operating contracts total contractual cash obligations a only includes interest on fixed rate debt 
b future film liabilities reflect a license agreement for program material that is not yet available for its first showing or telecast and is therefore not recorded as an asset or liability on our balance sheet 
pursuant to sfas no 
 financial reporting for broadcasters  an asset and a liability for the rights acquired and obligations incurred under a license agreement are reported on the balance sheet when the cost of each program is known or reasonably determinable  the program material has been accepted by the licensee in accordance with the conditions of the license agreement and the program is available for its first showing or telecast 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec include the following four items obligations under certain guarantees or contracts  retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements  obligations under certain derivative arrangements  and obligations under material variable interests 
we have entered into arrangements where we have obligations under certain guarantees or contracts because we believe they will help improve shareholder returns 
the following table reflects a summary of these off balance sheet arrangements a as defined by the sec as of december  and the future periods in which such arrangements may be settled in cash if certain contingent events occur in thousands total and thereafter letters of credit guarantees investments b purchase options c lma and outsourcing agreements d total other commercial commitments a there are no off balance sheet arrangements related to discontinued operations 
b commitments to contribute capital to allegiance capital  lp and sterling ventures partners  lp 
c we have entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party  whereby the unrelated third party may require us to purchase certain license and non license broadcast assets at the option of the unrelated third party  no earlier than july  the contractual commitment for and beyond represents the increase in purchase option price should the exercise occur in or we intend to exercise the license and non license options prior to march  d certain lmas require us to reimburse the licensee owner their operating costs 
certain outsourcing agreements require us to pay a fee to another station for providing non programming services 
the amount will vary each month and accordingly  these amounts were estimated through the date of the agreements expiration  based on historical cost experience 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities 
our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies such as general economic conditions  geopolitical events  competition  technological obsolescence and employee relations 
the risks described below  along with risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial  may impair our business operations and our liquidity in a material adverse way 
our advertising revenue can vary substantially from period to period based on many factors beyond our control 
this volatility affects our operating results and may reduce our ability to repay indebtedness or reduce the market value of our securities 
we rely on sales of advertising time for substantially all of our revenues and as a result  our operating results are sensitive to the amount of advertising revenue we generate 
if we generate less revenue  it may be more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness and the value of all our business may decline 
our ability to sell advertising time depends on the levels of automobile advertising  which generally represents about one fourth of our advertising revenue  the health of the economy in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole  the popularity of our programming  changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located  pricing fluctuations in local and national advertising  the activities of our competitors  including increased competition from other forms of advertising based mediums  particularly network  cable television  direct satellite television  telecommunications  internet and radio  the decreased demand for political advertising in non election years  and other factors that may be beyond our control 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 
we have a high level of debt totaling billion at december  compared to the book value of shareholders equity of million on the same date 
our relatively high level of debt poses the following risks  particularly in periods of declining revenues we use a significant portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt and to pay dividends on preferred and common stock  limiting the amount available for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  our lenders may not be as willing to lend additional amounts to us for future working capital needs  additional acquisitions or other purposes  the interest rate under the bank credit agreement  is a floating rate and will increase if general interest rates increase 
this will reduce the funds available to repay our obligations and for operations and future business opportunities and will make us more vulnerable to the consequences of our leveraged capital structure  we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than less leveraged competitors and thus  less able to withstand competitive pressures  if our cash flow were inadequate to make interest and principal payments  we might have to refinance our indebtedness or sell one or more of our stations to reduce debt service obligations  and our ability to finance our working capital needs and general corporate purposes for the public and private markets  as well as the associated cost of funding is dependent  in part  by our credit ratings 
as of december   our credit ratings  as assigned by moody s investor services moody s and standard poor s ratings services s p were moody s s p senior secured credit facilities ba bb senior implied ba senior unsecured issuer ba corporate credit bb senior subordinated notes b b convertible senior subordinated notes b b convertible preferred stock caa b the credit ratings previously stated are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
any of these events could reduce our ability to generate cash available for investment or debt repayment or to make improvements or respond to events that would enhance profitability 
we may not close on the sale of our television stations in on december   we entered into an agreement to sell kovr tv in sacramento  california for million 
we expect to close on this station sale in and we expect to use the after tax proceeds to repay our long term debt 
if we do not close on this transaction  we may not be able to fulfill some or all of our debt obligations 
on november   we entered into an agreement to sell ksmo tv in kansas city  missouri for million 
we have received million in cash when we entered into the agreement and we expect to receive the remaining million in upon fcc approval to transfer the broadcast license 
if we do not close on the transaction we will not receive the remaining million due to us 
we may be able to incur significantly more debt in the future  which will increase each of the foregoing risks related to our indebtedness 
at december   we had an additional million available subject to certain borrowing conditions for additional borrowings under the bank credit agreement of which million of current borrowing capacity was available 
in addition  under the terms of our debt instruments  we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future  including additional senior debt and in some cases secured debt 
provided we meet certain financial and other covenants  the terms of the indentures governing our outstanding notes do not prohibit us from incurring such additional indebtedness 
if we incur additional indebtedness  the risks described above relating to having substantial debt could intensify 
as a result of the late filing of form k in august  we are ineligible to register securities on form s until august in addition  upon the filing of this form k  we will become ineligible to issue securities under our currently effective shelf registration statement until august the inability to register securities on form s or to issue securities under our shelf registration statement until august could adversely affect our ability to raise capital during this period 
we must purchase television programming in advance and may therefore incur programming costs that we cannot cover with revenue from these programs 
if this happens  we could experience losses that may make our securities less valuable 
one of our most significant costs is television programming and our ability to generate revenue to cover this cost may affect the value of our securities 
if a particular program is not popular in relation to its costs  we may not be able to sell enough advertising time to cover the costs of the program 
since we generally purchase programming content from others rather than produce it ourselves  we have little control over the costs of programming 
we usually must purchase programming several years in advance and may have to commit to purchase more than one year s worth of programming 
finally  we may replace programs that are doing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred or before we have fully amortized the costs 
any of these factors could reduce our revenues or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues 
these factors are exacerbated during a weak advertising market 
additionally  our business is subject to the popularity of the programs provided by the networks with which we have network affiliation agreements or which provide us programming 
excluding political revenue  each of our affiliation groups experienced revenue increases in  but this trend may not continue in the future 
promises we have made to our lenders limit our ability to take actions that could increase the value of our securities or may require us to take actions that decrease the value of our securities 
our existing financing agreements prevent us from taking certain actions and require us to meet certain tests 
these restrictions and tests may require us to conduct our business in ways that make it more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness or decrease the value of our business 
these restrictions and tests include the following restrictions on additional debt  restrictions on our ability to pledge our assets as security for our indebtedness  restrictions on payment of dividends  the repurchase of stock and other payments relating to capital stock  restrictions on some sales of assets and the use of proceeds from asset sales  restrictions on mergers and other acquisitions  satisfaction of conditions for acquisitions and a limit on the total amount of acquisitions without consent of bank lenders  restrictions on the type of businesses we and our subsidiaries may be in  restrictions on the type and amounts of investments we and our subsidiaries may make  and financial ratio and condition tests including the ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as adjusted adjusted ebitda to total interest expense  the ratio of adjusted ebitda to certain of our fixed expenses and the ratio of indebtedness to adjusted ebitda 
future financing arrangements may contain additional restrictions and tests 
all of these restrictive covenants may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies  prevent us from taking action that could increase the value of our securities or may require actions that decrease the value of our securities 
in addition  we may fail to meet the tests and thereby default on one or more of our obligations particularly if the economy continues to soften and thereby reduces our advertising revenues 
if we default on our obligations  creditors could require immediate payment of the obligations or foreclose on collateral 
if this happens  we could be forced to sell assets or take other action that would reduce significantly the value of our securities and we may not have sufficient assets or funds to pay our debt obligations 
key officers and directors have financial interests that are different and sometimes opposite our own and we may engage in transactions with these officers and directors that may benefit them to the detriment of other securityholders 
some of our officers  directors and majority shareholders own stock or partnership interests in businesses that engage in television broadcasting  do business with us or otherwise do business that conflicts with our interests 
they may transact some business with us even when there is a conflict of interest or they may engage in business competitive to our business and those transactions may benefit the officers  directors or majority shareholders to the detriment of our other securityholders

we can give no assurance that these transactions or any transactions that we may enter into in the future with our officers  directors or majority shareholders  have been  or will be  negotiated on terms as favorable to us as we would obtain from unrelated parties 
maryland law and our financing agreements limit the extent to which our officers  directors and majority shareholders may transact business with us and pursue business opportunities that we might pursue 
these limitations do not  however  prohibit all such transactions 
for additional information related to transactions with related parties  see note related party transactions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the smiths exercise control over most matters submitted to a shareholder vote and may have interests that differ from yours 
they may  therefore  take actions that are not in the interests of other securityholders

smith hold shares representing almost of the common stock voting rights and therefore control the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of shareholders  including  but not limited to  electing directors  adopting amendments to our certificate of incorporation and approving corporate transactions 
the smiths hold substantially all of the class b common stock  which generally has ten votes per share 
our class a common stock has only one vote per share 
our series d of preferred stock generally does not have voting rights 
in addition  the smiths hold half our board of director seats and therefore  have the power to exert significant influence over our corporate management and policies 
the smiths have entered into a stockholders agreement pursuant to which they have agreed to vote for each other as candidates for election to the board of directors until june  circumstances may occur in which the interests of the smiths  as the controlling equity holders  could be in conflict with the interests of other securityholders and the smiths would have the ability to cause us to take actions in their interest 
in addition  the smiths could pursue acquisitions  divestitures or other transactions that  in their judgment  could enhance their equity investment  even though such transactions might involve risks to our other securityholders 
see item security ownership of certain beneficial owners and item certain relationships and related transactions 
for additional information related to transactions with related parties  see note related party transactions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
certain features of our capital structure that discourage others from attempting to acquire our company may prevent our securityholders from receiving a premium on their securities or result in a lower price for our securities 
the control the smiths have over shareholder votes may discourage other parties from trying to acquire us 
in addition  our board of directors can issue additional shares of preferred stock with rights that might further discourage other parties from trying to acquire us 
anyone trying to acquire us would likely offer to pay more for shares of class a common stock than the amount those shares were trading for in the open market at the time of the offer 
if the voting rights of the smiths or the right to issue preferred stock discourage such takeover attempts  shareholders may be denied the opportunity to receive such a premium 
the general level of prices for class a common stock might also be lower than it would otherwise be if these deterrents to takeovers did not exist 
the commencement of the iraq war resulted in a decline in advertising revenues and negatively impacted our operating results 
future conflicts may have a similar effect 
the commencement of the war in iraq resulted in a reduction in advertising revenues as a result of uninterrupted news coverage and general economic uncertainty 
during the first quarter  we experienced million in advertiser cancellations and preemptions  which resulted in lower earnings than we would have experienced without this disruption 
if the united states becomes engaged in similar conflicts in the future  they may have a similar adverse impact on our results of operations 
we may lose a large amount of programming if a network terminates its affiliation with us  which could increase our costs and or reduce our revenue 
network affiliation agreements sixty of the television stations that we own and operate  or to which we provide programming services or sales services  currently operate as affiliates of fox stations  wb stations  abc stations  nbc stations  upn stations and cbs stations 
the remaining two stations are independent 
the networks produce and distribute programming in exchange for each station s commitment to air the programming at specified times and for commercial announcement time during the programming 
during july  we entered into an affiliation agreement with abc for wkef tv in dayton  ohio 
wkef tv channel switched from its nbc network affiliation to the abc television network beginning august  wkef tv s current syndicated and local news programming continues to be aired on channel as of december   the corresponding net book value of the affiliation agreement was million 
we tested the affiliation agreement of wkef tv for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and determined that this asset was not impaired 
the nbc affiliation agreement with wics wicd tv in champaign springfield  illinois expired on april  we continue to program this station as an nbc affiliate without a formal agreement 
on february   nbc informed us that they intend to terminate our affiliation with wics wicd effective september in order to affiliate with another station in that market 
we have engaged in discussions with abc television network regarding affiliating with abc in that market because the station which is scheduled to acquire our nbc affiliation is currently the abc affiliate in champaign springfield 
as of december   the corresponding net book value of the affiliation agreement was million 
during december  we entered into renewals with cbs broadcasting  inc of all of our affiliation agreements for upn and cbs 
the upn agreements terminate in july of and two of the cbs agreements terminate in december of and one expires march the affiliation agreements of five abc stations wsyx tv in columbus  ohio  wlos tv in asheville  north carolina  wchs tv in charleston  west virginia  wear tv in pensacola  florida  and wggb in springfield  massachusetts have expired  in the case of wlos and wsyx  these agreements including extensions thereto expired on january   the other agreements expired prior to we continue to operate these stations as abc affiliates and we do not believe abc has any current plans to terminate the affiliation with any of these stations  although we can make no assurance that abc will not do so 
we are currently engaged in negotiations with abc regarding continuing our network affiliation agreements 
the net aggregate book value of these abc affiliate agreements was million as of december  the affiliation agreements of our fox stations will expire on june  we have begun preliminary negotiations to renew our affiliation agreements 
the aggregate net book value of our fox affiliate agreements was million as of december  the non renewal or termination of one or more of these or any of our other network affiliation agreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the relevant network 
this loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming  which may involve higher costs and which may not be as attractive to our target audiences  resulting in reduced revenues 
upon the termination of any of the above affiliation agreements  we would be required to establish new affiliation agreements with other networks or operate as an independent station 
at such time  the remaining value of the network affiliation asset could become impaired and we would be required to write down the value of the asset 
at this time we cannot predict the final outcome of these negotiations and any impact they may have on our financial position  consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows 
competition from other broadcasters and changes in technology may cause a reduction in our advertising revenues and or an increase in our operating costs 
the television industry is highly competitive and this competition can draw viewers and advertisers from our stations  which reduces our revenue or requires us to pay more for programming  which increases our costs 
we face intense competition from the following new technology and the subdivision of markets cable providers and direct broadcast satellite companies are developing new technology that allow them to transmit more channels on their existing equipment to highly targeted audiences  reducing the cost of creating channels and potentially leading to the division of the television industry into ever more specialized niche markets 
competitors who target programming to such sharply defined markets may gain an advantage over us for television advertising revenues 
lowering the cost of creating channels may also encourage new competitors to enter our markets and compete with us for advertising revenue 
in addition  emerging technologies that will allow viewers to digitally record  store and play back television programming may decrease viewership of commercials and  as a result  lower our advertising revenues 
in market competition we also face more conventional competition from rivals that may have greater resources than we have 
these include other local free over the air broadcast stations  and other media  such as newspapers  periodicals and cable and satellite systems 
deregulation the telecommunications act of and subsequent actions by the fcc have removed some limits on station ownership  allowing telephone  cable and some other companies to provide video services in competition with us 
in addition  the fcc has reallocated a portion of the spectrum for new services including fixed and mobile wireless services and digital broadcast services 
as a result of these changes  new companies are able to enter our markets and compete with us 
the phased introduction of digital television will increase our costs  due to increased equipment and operational costs and could have a variety of other adverse effects on our business 
the fcc has adopted rules for implementing digital including high definition television dtv service in the united states 
under the rules  our stations are required to begin dtv operations over a transition period 
in addition  we expect that the fcc will reclaim our non digital channels at the end of the transition period 
we believe that the transition to dtv may have the following effects on us  which could increase our costs or reduce our revenue conversion and programming costs we have incurred million through december   to convert our stations from the current analog format to digital format 
we expect to continue to incur costs to convert our stations to digital format and we may incur additional costs to obtain programming for the additional channels made available by digital technology and higher utility costs as a result of converting to digital operations 
increased revenues from the additional channels may not make up for the conversion cost and additional programming expenses 
possible sanctions the fcc has adopted a series of graduated sanctions to be imposed upon licensees who do not meet the fcc s dtv build out schedule 
some of our stations could face monetary fines and possible loss of any digital construction permits if they cannot comply with the dtv build out schedule 
reclamation of analog channels congress directed the fcc to auction analog channels when the current holders convert to digital transmission 
in addition  the fcc has reallocated a portion of the spectrum band to permit both wireless services and to allow new broadcast operations 
if the channels are owned or programmed by our competitors  they may exert increased competitive pressure on our operations 
signal quality issues our signal quality under digital transmission may be lower relative to our competitors 
this may cause us to lose viewers and thereby lose revenue or be forced to rely on cable television or other alternative means of transmission with higher costs to deliver our digital signals to all of the viewers we are able to reach with our current analog signals 
station revenue could be effected by a reduction in advertising because cable customers in our broadcast market may not receive our digital signal 
digital must carry in february  the fcc adopted an order stating that cable television systems are not required to carry both a station s analog and digital signals during the digital transition 
the same order also clarified that a cable system need only carry a broadcast station s primary video stream  and not any of the station s other programming streams in those situations where a station chooses to transmit multiple programming streams 
cable customers in our broadcast markets may only be able to receive our digital signal over the air  which could negatively impact our stations 
many of the viewers of our television stations receive the signals of the stations via cable television service 
cable television systems generally transmit our signals pursuant to permission granted by us in retransmission consent agreements 
a material portion of these agreements have no definite term and may be terminated either by us or by the applicable cable television company on very short notice typically or days 
we are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to these agreements with several major cable television companies and we recently reached an agreement with comcast  the nation s largest cable operator 
there can be no assurance that the results of these negotiations will be advantageous to us or that we or the cable companies might not determine to terminate some or all of these agreements 
a termination of our retransmission agreements would make it more difficult for our viewers to watch our programming and could result in lower ratings and a negative financial impact on us 
in addition  we generally have not provided the major cable television companies with the right to transmit our stations digital signals 
although the lack of carriage of these signals does not at this time have a material impact on our current results of operations  this could change as the number of households in the united states with the capability of viewing digital and high definition television increases 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate mutually acceptable retransmission agreements in the future relating to the carriage of our digital signals 
subscription fees the fcc has determined to assess a fee in the amount of of gross revenues on digital television subscription services 
if we provide subscription services and are unable to pass this cost through to our subscribers  this fee will reduce our earnings from any digital television subscription services we implement in the future 
given this climate of market uncertainty and regulatory change  we cannot be sure what impact the fcc s actions might have on our plans and results in the area of digital television 
see item business 
federal regulation of the broadcasting industry limits our operating flexibility  which may affect our ability to generate revenue or reduce our costs 
the fcc regulates our business  just as it does all other companies in the broadcasting industry 
we must ask the fcc s approval whenever we need a new license  seek to renew  assign or modify a license  purchase a new station  sell an existing station  or transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license 
our fcc licenses and those of the stations we program pursuant to lmas are critical to our operations  we cannot operate without them 
we cannot be certain that the fcc will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions 
if licenses were not renewed or acquisitions approved  we may lose revenue that we otherwise could have earned 
in addition  congress and the fcc may in the future adopt new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters including technological changes that could  directly or indirectly  materially and adversely affect the operation and ownership of our broadcast properties 
see item business 
the fcc s multiple ownership rules limit our ability to operate multiple television stations in some markets and may result in a reduction in our revenue or prevent us from reducing costs 
changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets 
changes in rules on television ownership congress passed a bill requiring the fcc to increase the national audience reach cap from to and president bush signed the bill into law on january  this law permits broadcast television owners to own more television stations nationally  potentially affecting our competitive position 
in june  the fcc adopted new multiple ownership rules 
in june  the court of appeals for the third circuit issued a decision which upheld a portion of such rules and remanded the matter to the fcc for further justification of the rules 
the court also issued a stay of the new rules pending the remand 
we cannot predict the outcome of the remand or any subsequent court actions 
changes to the rules imposed by the fcc on remand or by the third circuit could significantly impact our business 
changes in rules on local marketing agreements certain of our stations have entered into what have commonly been referred to as local marketing agreements or lmas 
one typical type of lma is a programming agreement between two separately owned television stations serving the same market  whereby the licensee of one station programs substantial portions of the broadcast day and sells advertising time during such program segments on the other licensee s station subject to the ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter licensee 
we believe these arrangements allow us to reduce our operating expenses and enhance profitability 
under the fcc ownership rules adopted in  we would be allowed to continue to program most of the stations with which we have an lma 
in the absence of a waiver  the new rules would require us to terminate or modify three of our lmas in markets where both the station we own and the station with which we have an lma are ranked among the top four stations in their particular designated market area 
the fcc s new ownership rules include specific provisions permitting waivers of this top four restriction 
although there can be no assurances  we have studied the application of the new rules to our markets and believe we are qualified for waivers 
the new rules have been stayed by the us court of appeals for the third circuit and are on remand to the fcc 
several parties have filed with the supreme court of the united states petitions for writ of certiorari defined below seeking review of the third circuit decision 
because the new ownership rules have been remanded  it is not clear if we will be required to terminate or modify our lmas in markets where we have such arrangements 
a petition for a writ of certiorari is a legal term that means a document filed with the u 
s 
supreme court asking the court to review the decision of a lower court 
it includes  among other things  an argument as to why the supreme court should hear the appeal 
on march   we filed a conditional cross petition with the u 
s 
supreme court asking the court to consider our arguments together with the arguments contained in the petitions filed by the other parties 
when the fcc decided to attribute lmas for ownership purposes in  it grandfathered our lmas that were entered into prior to november   permitting the applicable stations to continue operations pursuant to the lmas until the conclusion of the fcc s biennial review 
the fcc stated it would conduct a case by case review of grandfathered lmas and assess the appropriateness of extending the grandfathering period 
recently  the fcc invited comments as to whether  instead of beginning the review of the grandfathered lmas in  it should do so in we cannot predict when the fcc will begin its review of those lmas 
because the effectiveness of the new rules has been stayed and  in connection with the adoption of the new rules  the fcc concluded the old rules could not be justified as necessary to the public interest  we have taken the position that an issue exists regarding whether the fcc has any current legal right to enforce any rules prohibiting the acquisition of television stations 
the fcc  however  dismissed our applications to acquire certain lma stations 
we filed an application for review of that decision  which is still pending 
on november   we entered into five separate plans and agreements of merger  pursuant to which we would acquire through merger with subsidiaries of cunningham  television broadcast stations wabm tv  birmingham  alabama  krrt tv  san antonio  texas  wvtv tv  milwaukee  wisconsin  wrdc tv  raleigh durham  north carolina and wbsc tv formerly wfbc tv  anderson  south carolina 
the consideration for these mergers was the issuance to cunningham  of shares of our class a common voting stock 
in december  we received fcc approval on all the transactions except wbsc tv 
accordingly  on february   we closed on the purchase of the fcc license and related assets of wabm tv  birmingham  alabama  krrt tv  san antonio  texas  wvtv tv  milwaukee  wisconsin and wrdc tv  raleigh durham  north carolina 
the total value of the shares issued in consideration for the approved mergers was million 
we have filed a petition for reconsideration with the fcc to reconsider its denial of the acquisition of wbsc tv and amended our application to acquire the license in light of the fcc s new multiple ownership rules 
however  the new rules have been stayed 
we also filed applications in november to acquire the license assets of the remaining five cunningham stations  wrgt tv  dayton  ohio  wtat tv  charleston  south carolina  wvah tv  charleston  west virginia  wnuv tv  baltimore  maryland  and wtte tv  columbus  ohio 
the rainbow push coalition filed a petition to deny these five applications and to revoke all of our licenses 
the fcc dismissed our applications in light of the stay of the new ownership rules  and we filed an application for review of the dismissal  which may be impacted by the remand of the fcc s new multiple ownership rules 
the fcc denied the rainbow push petition  and rainbow filed a petition for reconsideration of that denial 
both the applications and the associated petition to deny are still pending 
we believe the rainbow push petition is without merit 
if we are required to terminate or modify our lmas  our business could be affected in the following ways losses on investments 
as part of our lma arrangements  we own the non license assets used by the stations with which we have lmas 
if certain of these lma arrangements are no longer permitted  we would be forced to sell these assets  restructure our agreements or find another use for them 
if this happens  the market for such assets may not be as good as when we purchased them and  therefore  we cannot be certain that we will recoup our original investments 
termination penalties 
if the fcc requires us to modify or terminate existing lmas before the terms of the lmas expire  or under certain circumstances  we elect not to extend the term of the lmas  we may be forced to pay termination penalties under the terms of some of our lmas 
any such termination penalty could be material 
use of outsourcing agreements in addition to our lmas and duopolies  we have entered into four and may seek opportunities for additional outsourcing agreements in which our stations provide or are provided various non programming related services such as sales  operational and managerial services to or by other stations 
pursuant to these agreements  our stations currently provide services to other stations in tallahassee  florida and nashville  tennessee and other parties provide services to our stations in peoria bloomington  illinois and in cedar rapids  iowa 
we believe this structure allows stations to achieve operational efficiencies and economies of scale  which should otherwise improve broadcast cash flow and competitive positions 
while television joint sales agreements jsas are not currently attributable  on august   the fcc released a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comments on its tentative conclusion that television joint sales agreements should be attributable 
we cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding  nor can we predict how any changes  together with possible changes to the ownership rules  would apply to our existing outsourcing agreements 
failure of owner licensee to exercise control the fcc requires the owner licensee of a station to maintain independent control over the programming and operations of the station 
as a result  the owners licensees of those stations with which we have lmas or outsourcing agreements can exert their control in ways that may counter our interests  including the right to preempt or terminate programming in certain instances 
the preemption and termination rights cause some uncertainty as to whether we will be able to air all of the programming that we have purchased and therefore  uncertainty about the advertising revenue that we will receive from such programming 
in addition  if the fcc determines that the owner licensee is not exercising sufficient control  it may penalize the owner licensee by a fine  revocation of the license for the station or a denial of the renewal of that license 
any one of these scenarios might result in a reduction of our cash flow and an increase in our operating costs or margins  especially the revocation of or denial of renewal of a license 
in addition  penalties might also affect our qualifications to hold fcc licenses and thus put those licenses at risk 
we have lost money in two of the last five years  and may continue to incur losses in the future  which may impair our ability to pay our debt obligations 
we reported earnings in and  but we have suffered net losses in two of the last five years 
in  we reported earnings  but this was largely due to a gain on the sale of our radio stations 
our losses are due to a variety of cash and non cash expenses which may or may not recur 
our net losses may therefore continue indefinitely and as a result  we may not have sufficient funds to operate our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
we enter into derivative instruments primarily for the purpose of reducing the impact of changing interest rates on our floating rate debt and to reduce the impact of changing fair market values on our fixed rate debt 
we account for derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
collectively  sfas 
for additional information on sfas see note derivative instruments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we held the following derivative instruments we hold two interest rate swap agreements with two financial institutions that have notional amounts totaling million that expire on june  in june  we assigned million of the notional amount to a second financial institution 
these swap agreements require us to pay a fixed rate  which is set in the range of to and receive a floating rate based on the three month london interbank offered rate libor 
libor is a measurement and settlement is performed quarterly 
these swap agreements are reflected as a derivative obligation based on their fair value of million and million as a component of other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  and december   respectively 
these swap agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas  therefore  changes in their fair market values are reflected currently in earnings as unrealized gain loss from derivative instruments 
we incurred an unrealized gain related to these instruments of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the unrealized gain loss from derivative instruments related to these swap agreements do not impact our financial covenants under the bank credit agreement 
on december   the instrument with a notional amount of million contained a european style termination option that is  exercisable only on the expiration date and could be terminated partially or in full by the counterparty on june  at its fair market value 
the instrument was amended march   resulting in removal of termination option by the counterparty 
the interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million does not have an option to terminate before it expires 
we estimate the fair market value of the million and million agreements at december  to be a liability of million and million  respectively  based on a quotation from the counterparty 
these amounts are reflected as a component of other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we estimate that a increase in interest rates would result in a gain of million  while a decrease would result in a loss of million  in march  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million which expire on march   for which we receive a fixed rate of and pay a floating rate based on libor measurement and settlement is performed quarterly 
these swaps are accounted for as a hedge of our senior subordinated notes in accordance with sfas whereby changes in the fair market value of the swaps are reflected as adjustments to the carrying amount of the senior subordinated notes 
these swaps are reflected in the accompanying balance sheet as a derivative asset and as a premium on the senior subordinated notes based on their fair value of million 
consequently  we had million in floating rate debt at december  and a increase in libor would result in annualized interest expense of approximately million 
we estimate that a increase in interest rates would result in a loss of million  while a decrease would result in a gain of million  and in november  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million  which expire march   for which we receive a fixed rate of and pay a floating rate based on libor measurement and settlement is performed quarterly 
these swaps are accounted for as a hedge of our senior subordinated notes in accordance with sfas  whereby changes in the fair market value of the swaps are reflected as adjustments to the carrying amount of the senior subordinated notes 
these swaps are reflected on the accompanying balance sheet as a derivative asset and as a premium on the senior subordinated notes based on their fair value of million 
consequently  we had million in floating rate debt at december  and a increase in libor would result in annualized interest expense of approximately million 
we estimate that a increase in interest rates would result in a loss of million  while a decrease would result in a gain of million 
the counterparties to these agreements are international financial institutions 
we estimate the net fair value of these instruments at december  to be a liability of million 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is estimated by obtaining quotations from the financial institutions  which are a party to our derivative contracts 
the fair value is an estimate of the net amount that we would pay on december  if we cancelled the contracts or transferred them to other parties 
we are also exposed to risk from a change in interest rates to the extent we are required to refinance existing fixed rate indebtedness at rates higher than those prevailing at the time the existing indebtedness was incurred 
as of december   we had senior subordinated notes totaling million  million and million expiring in the years  and  respectively 
based upon the quoted market price  the fair value of the notes was billion as of december  generally  the fair market value of the notes will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall 
we estimate that a increase from prevailing interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of the notes by approximately million as of december  the estimates related to the increase or decrease of interest rates are based on assumptions for forecasted future interest rates
