item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general overview our products and services are marketed in at least states to over  customers that are engaged in a variety of industries  many of which may be countercyclical to each other 
demand for our products generally is subject to changes in the united states economy and economic trends affecting our customers and the industries in which they compete in particular 
certain of these industries  such as the oil and gas industry  are subject to volatility while others  such as the petrochemical industry and the construction industry  are cyclical and materially affected by changes in the economy 
as a result  we may experience changes in demand within particular markets  segments and product categories as changes occur in our customers respective markets 
during and  our performance was impacted negatively by the economic downturn  particularly the downturn in domestic manufacturing 
all of our increase in sales and gross profit for compared to was due to increased sale s of products for offshore energy production 
our employee headcount decreased by over ten percent during as we worked to bring our cost structure in line with our sales 
during the economy improved 
our employee headcount decreased by approximately during we plan to increase our headcount during the majority of the sales increase came from increased sales of products for offshore energy production and general manufacturing 
our sales growth strategy in recent years has focused on internal growth 
key elements of our sales strategy include leveraging existing customer relationships by cross selling new products  expanding product offerings to new and existing customers  increased business to business solutions using system agreements and smartsource sm solutions for our integrated supply customers 
we are also interested in growing through the acquisition of distributors that would expand our geographic breadth 
results will be dependent on our success in executing our internal growth strategy and  to the extent we complete any acquisitions  our ability to integrate such acquisitions 
our cost reduction strategies include consolidated purchasing programs  centralized product distribution centers  centralizing certain customer service and inside sales functions  converting selected locations from full warehouse and customer service operations to dxp service centers  and using information technology to increase employee productivity

revenues for increased million  or  to approximately million from million in sales for the mro segment increased million  or primarily due to increased sales of products for offshore energy production and general manufacturing 
sales for the electrical contractor segment decreased by million  or  when compared to this decline resulted from an effort to focus on sales of higher margin specialty electrical products and to be selective on sales of lower margin commodity type electrical products 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately for  when compared to gross profit as a percentage of sales for the mro segment decreased to for  from in this decrease can be attributed to increased costs incurred due to leaks discovered during pressure testing of a recently introduced type of fiberglass pipe installed on several offshore energy production platforms and the abnormal frequency and magnitude of recent vendor price increases which made it difficult to immediately pass through the increases to our customers 
we are working to pass these increases to our customers 
gross profit as a percentage of sales for the electrical contractor segment increased to for  from in this increase resulted from increased sales of higher margin specialty type electrical products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense for was approximately the same as for as a percentage of revenue  the expense decreased by approximately to from for this decrease is attributable to an increase in productivity 
operating income 
operating income for increased when compared to operating income for the mro segment increased as a result of gross profit increasing more than selling  general and administrative expense increased 
operating income for the electrical contractor segment increased when compared to the improved operating income for the electrical contractor segment is the result of reduced selling  general and administrative expense combined with increased gross profit from increased sales of higher margin specialty type electrical products 
interest expense 
interest expense for decreased by  to million from million during this decline results from a lower average debt balance for when compared to income taxes 
as of december   we have recorded net deferred tax assets of million representing the future tax benefits of certain accruals not currently deductible 
we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized as these reserves are recovered and reduce future taxable income 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
revenues for increased million  or  to approximately million from million in sales for the mro segment increased million  or primarily due to increased sales of products for offshore energy production 
sales for the electrical contractor segment decreased by million  or  when compared to this decrease was the result of a slow down in the commercial construction business for electrical contractors 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately for  when compared to this decrease resulted from decreased sales by the higher margin electrical contractor segment and increased sales by the lower margin mro segment 
gross profit as a percentage of sales for the mro segment was in and gross profit as a percentage of sales for the electrical contractor segment increased to for  up from in this increase resulted from the decision to focus on selling higher margin specialty electrical products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense for increased by approximately million  or  when compared to this increase was primarily attributable to increased employee benefits and incentive compensation related to the increased gross profit 
as a percentage of revenue  the expense decreased by approximately to from for this decrease was primarily attributable to costs increasing at a lower rate than revenue increased 
operating income 
operating income for increased by approximately million  or  when compared to this increase was the result of a increase in operating income for the mro segment and improvement from a loss to a profit for the electrical contractor segment 
interest expense 
interest expense for decreased by million to million from million for this decline resulted from lower interest rates for when compared to as well as a lower average debt balance 
liquidity and capital resources general overview as a distributor of mro products and electrical contractor products  we require significant amounts of working capital to fund inventories and accounts receivable 
additional cash is required for capital items such as information technology and warehouse equipment 
we also require cash to pay our lease obligations and to service our debt 
we generated cash in operating activities of approximately million in as compared to million in cash provided during this change between the two years was primarily attributable to the million of customer advances as of december  compared to million of customer advances as of december  the balance of customer advances declined because we completed the projects associated with the advances 
we purchased products and incurred other costs to complete the projects during we purchased approximately million of capital assets during compared to million for capital expenditures during were related primarily to computer equipment  computer software and pump testing equipment 
the capital expenditures related primarily to an airplane and computer equipment 
we purchased the airplane to increase our efficiency in marketing to a nationwide customer base and managing our numerous remote locations 
capital expenditures for are expected to be similar to the amounts for at december  our long term debt was million compared to total capitalization long term debt plus shareholders equity of million 
approximately million of this outstanding debt bears interest at various floating rates 
therefore  as an example  a basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
during  liquidity was negatively impacted by an increase in the accounts receivable days of sales outstanding 
the increase resulted primarily from several large customers not paying us within stated terms 
during liquidity was positively impacted by the collection of these receivables 
our normal trade terms require payment within days of invoice date 
in response to competition and customer demands we will offer extended terms to selected customers with good credit history 
customers that are financially strong tend to request extended terms more often than customers that are not financially strong 
many of our customers  including companies listed in the fortune  do not pay us within stated terms for a variety of reasons  including a general business philosophy to pay vendors as late as possible 
we generally collect the amounts due from these large  slow paying customers 
during  the amount available to be borrowed under our credit facility increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase in availability during resulted from reducing the amount borrowed under the credit line by million  partially offset by a decrease in the collateral value of inventory and accounts receivable 
the funds to reduce long term debt by million were generated by operations 
management believes that the liquidity of our balance sheet at december   provides us with the ability to meet our working capital needs  scheduled principal payments  capital expenditures and series b preferred stock dividend payments during credit facility under the credit facility  all available cash is generally applied to reduce outstanding borrowings  with operations funded through borrowings under the credit facility 
the credit facility consists of a secured line of credit and a secured term loan 
the credit facility was amended and restated on june  the amendment extended the maturity  modified the calculation of collateral value which increased borrowing availability  reduced the maximum borrowing amount to million  and allows us to elect a rate of interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to or prime plus a margin ranging from to 
before the amendment  the interest rate was prime plus on the revolving portion of the credit facility and prime plus on the term portion of the credit facility 
at december  these rates were prime and prime plus  respectively 
additionally  the libor interest option resulted in interest rates  which were lower than the prime interest option 
at december   million was borrowed under the libor option at a weighted average rate of 
the prime rate at december  was the credit facility provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of the lesser of i a percentage of the collateral value based on a formula set forth therein or ii million  and matures april  the credit facility is secured by receivables  inventory  real estate and machinery and equipment 
the credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as financial covenants that are measured monthly and require that we maintain a certain cash flow and other financial ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
although we expect to be able to comply with the covenants of the credit facility  there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to do so or that our lender would be willing to waive such non compliance or amend such covenants 
in addition to the million of cash at december   we had million available for borrowings under the credit facility at december  borrowings december  increase decrease in thousands current portion of long term debt long term debt  less current portion total long term debt amount available represents amount available to be borrowed at the indicated date under the credit facility 
the funds to reduce long term debt by million were generated by operations the million increase in the amount available is primarily a result of reducing the amount borrowed under the credit line by million  partially offset by a decrease in the collateral value of inventory and accounts receivable 
performance metrics december  increase decrease in days days of sales outstanding inventory turns accounts receivable days of sales outstanding were at december  compared to at december  the decrease resulted primarily from the collection during of accounts receivable that were outstanding at december  from several large  slow paying customers 
annualized inventory turns were times at december  compared to times at december  the improvement resulted from reduced inventory of fiberglass pipe combined with active inventory management 
funding commitments our internal cash flow projections indicate our cash generated from operations and available under our credit facility will meet our normal working capital needs during however  we may require additional debt or equity financing to meet our future debt service obligations  which may include additional bank debt or the public or private sale of equity or debt securities 
in connection with any such financing  we may be required to issue securities that substantially dilute the interest of our shareholders 
as described above  all of our credit facility matures on or before april  we will need to extend the maturity of  or replace our credit facility on or before april  however  we may not be able to renew and extend or replace the credit facility 
any extended or replacement facility may have higher interest costs  less borrowing capacity  more restrictive conditions and could involve equity dilution 
our ability to obtain a satisfactory credit facility may depend  in part  upon the level of our asset base for collateral purposes  our future financial performance and our ability to obtain additional equity 
we would like to acquire companies that distribute mro products 
we would probably require additional capital to fund any future acquisitions 
we may pursue additional equity or debt financing to fund future acquisitions  although we may not be able to obtain additional financing on attractive terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including current portion operating lease obligations estimated interest payments total amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long term debt and do not include any fair value adjustment 
assumes interest rates in effect at december  assumes debt is paid on maturity date and not replaced 
does not include interest on the credit facility as borrowings under this line fluctuate 
the amounts of interest incurred for borrowings under the credit facility were   and  for  and  respectively 
management anticipates a similar level of interest payments on the credit facility in off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spe s  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
indemnification in the ordinary course of business  dxp enters into contractual arrangements under which dxp may agree to indemnify customers from any losses incurred relating to the services we perform 
such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
historically  payments made related to these indemnities have been immaterial 
discussion of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant estimates made by us in the accompanying financial statements relate to reserves for accounts receivable collectibility  inventory valuations  income taxes and self insured medical claims 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and require management s subjective or complex judgments 
these policies have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors of dxp 
below is a discussion of what we believe are our critical accounting policies 
also  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when an agreement is in place  price is fixed  title for product passes to the customer or services have been provided  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made monthly and adjustments are made periodically as circumstances warrant based upon the expected collectibility of all such accounts 
write offs could be materially different from the reserve provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends 
inventory inventory consists principally of finished goods and is priced at lower of cost or market  cost being determined using both the first in  first out fifo and the last in  first out lifo method 
reserves are provided against inventory for estimated obsolescence based upon the aging of the inventory and market trends 
actual obsolescence could be materially different from the reserve if economic conditions or market trends change significantly 
income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of million as of december  we believe it is more likely than not that this net deferred tax asset will be realized based primarily on the assumption of future taxable income 
self insured medical claims we accrue for the estimated outstanding balance of unpaid medical claims for our employees and their dependents 
the accrual is adjusted monthly based on recent claims experience 
the actual claims could deviate from recent claims experience and be materially different from the reserve 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
together with the effects of the matters discussed above  these factors may significantly impact the company s results of operations from period to period 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
inflation we do not believe the effects of inflation have any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we attempt to minimize inflationary trends by passing manufacturer price increases on to the customer whenever practicable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk results primarily from volatility in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our debt portfolio 
using floating interest rate debt outstanding at december   a basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by  the table below provides information about the company s market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
principal amount by expected maturity in thousands  except percentages there after total fair value fixed rate long term debt average interest rate floating rate long term debt average interest rate total maturities assumes floating interest rates in effect at december
