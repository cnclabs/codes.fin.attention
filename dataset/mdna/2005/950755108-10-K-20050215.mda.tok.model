overview the company operates in the truckload sector of the trucking industry  with a focus on transporting consumer nondurable products that ship more consistently throughout the year 
the company s success depends on its ability to efficiently manage its resources in the delivery of truckload transportation and logistics services to its customers 
resource requirements vary with customer demand  which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions 
the company s ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is a key element in efficiently deploying resources and in making capital investments in tractors and trailers 
although the company s business volume is not highly concentrated  the company may also be affected by the financial failure of its customers or a loss of a customer s business from time to time 
operating revenues consist of trucking revenues generated by the five operating fleets in the truckload transportation services segment medium long haul van  dedicated  regional short haul  flatbed  and temperature controlled and non trucking revenues generated primarily by the company s value added services segment 
the company s truckload transportation services segment also includes a small amount of non trucking revenues for the portion of shipments delivered to or from mexico where it utilizes a third party carrier  and for a few of its dedicated accounts where the services of third party carriers are used to meet customer capacity requirements 
non trucking revenues reported in the operating statistics table include those revenues generated by the vas segment  as well as the non trucking revenues generated by the truckload transportation services segment 
trucking revenues accounted for of total operating revenues in  and non trucking and other operating revenues accounted for 
trucking services typically generate revenue on a per mile basis 
other sources of trucking revenue include fuel surcharges and accessorial revenue such as stop charges  loading unloading charges  and equipment detention charges 
because fuel surcharge revenues fluctuate in response to changes in the cost of fuel  these revenues are identified separately within the operating statistics table and are excluded from the statistics to provide a more meaningful comparison between periods 
non trucking revenues generated by a fleet whose operations are part of the truckload transportation services segment are included in non trucking revenue in the operating statistics table so that the revenue statistics in the table are calculated using only the revenues generated by the company s trucks 
the key statistics used to evaluate trucking revenues  excluding fuel surcharges  are revenue per truck per week  the per mile rates charged to customers  the average monthly miles generated per tractor  the percentage of empty miles  the average trip length  and the number of tractors in service 
general economic conditions  seasonal freight patterns in the trucking industry  and industry capacity are key factors that impact these statistics 
the company s most significant resource requirements are qualified drivers  tractors  trailers  and related costs of operating its equipment such as fuel and related fuel taxes  driver pay  insurance  and supplies and maintenance 
the company has historically been successful mitigating its risk to increases in fuel prices by recovering additional fuel surcharges from its customers  however  there is no assurance that current recovery levels will continue in future periods 
for example  during the company s fuel expense and reimbursements to owner operator drivers for the higher cost of fuel resulted in an additional cost of million 
during  the company collected an additional million in fuel surcharge revenues from its customers to offset the fuel cost increase 
the company s financial results are also affected by availability of drivers and the market for new and used trucks 
because the company is self insured for cargo  personal injury  and property damage claims on its trucks and for workers compensation benefits for its employees supplemented by premium based coverage above certain dollar levels  financial results may also be affected by driver safety  medical costs  the weather  the legal and regulatory environment  and the costs of insurance coverage to protect against catastrophic losses 
a common industry measure used to evaluate the profitability of the company and its trucking operating fleets is the operating ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues 
the most significant variable expenses that impact the trucking operation are driver salaries and benefits  payments to owner operators included in rent and purchased transportation expense  fuel  fuel taxes included in taxes and licenses expense  supplies and maintenance  and insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary based on the number of miles generated 
as such  the company also evaluates these costs on a per mile basis to adjust for the impact on the percentage of total operating revenues caused by changes in fuel surcharge revenues  per mile rates charged to customers  and non trucking revenues 
as discussed further in the comparison of operating results for to  several industry wide issues  including uncertainty regarding possible changes to the hours of service regulations  a challenging driver recruiting market  and rising fuel prices  could cause costs to increase in future periods 
the company s main fixed costs include depreciation expense for tractors and trailers and equipment licensing fees included in taxes and licenses expense 
depreciation expense has been affected by the new engine emission standards that became effective in october for all newly purchased trucks  which have increased truck purchase costs 
the trucking operations require substantial cash expenditures for tractors and trailers 
the company has maintained a three year replacement cycle for company owned tractors 
these purchases are funded by net cash from operations  as the company repaid its last remaining debt in december non trucking services provided by the company  primarily through its vas division  include freight brokerage  intermodal  freight transportation management  and other services 
during  vas is expanding its service offerings to include multimodal  which is a blend of truck and rail intermodal services 
unlike the company s trucking operations  the non trucking operations are less asset intensive and are instead dependent upon information systems  qualified employees  and the services of other third party providers 
the most significant expense item related to these non trucking services is the cost of transportation paid by the company to third party providers  which is recorded as rent and purchased transportation expense 
other expenses include salaries  wages and benefits and computer hardware and software depreciation 
the company evaluates the non trucking operations by reviewing the gross margin percentage revenues less rent and purchased transportation expense expressed as a percentage of revenues and the operating margin 
the operating margins for the non trucking business are generally lower than those of the trucking operations  but the returns on assets are substantially higher 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain industry data regarding the freight revenues and operations of the company for the periods indicated 
trucking revenues  net of fuel surcharge      trucking fuel surcharge revenues      non trucking revenues  including vas      other operating revenues      operating revenues      operating ratio consolidated average revenues per tractor per week      average annual miles per tractor      average annual trips per tractor average total miles per trip average loaded miles per trip total miles loaded and empty      average revenues per total mile average revenues per loaded mile average percentage of empty miles average tractors in service      total tractors at year end company      owner operator    total tractors      total trailers at year end      amounts in thousands operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues 
operating ratio is a common measure in the trucking industry used to evaluate profitability 
net of fuel surcharge revenues the following table sets forth the revenues  operating expenses  and operating income for the truckload transportation services segment 
truckload transportation services amounts in s revenues    operating expenses    operating income    higher fuel prices and higher fuel surcharge collections have the effect of increasing the company s consolidated operating ratio and the truckload transportation services segment s operating ratio 
the following table calculates the truckload transportation services segment s operating ratio using total operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge revenues  as a percentage of revenues  excluding fuel surcharges 
eliminating this sometimes volatile source of revenue provides a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period 
truckload transportation services amounts in s revenues    less trucking fuel surcharge revenues    revenues  net of fuel surcharge    operating expenses    less trucking fuel surcharge revenues    operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge    operating income    the following table sets forth the non trucking revenues  operating expenses  and operating income for the vas segment 
other operating expenses for the vas segment primarily consist of salaries  wages and benefits expense 
vas also incurs smaller expense amounts in the supplies and maintenance  depreciation  rent and purchased transportation excluding third party transportation costs  communications and utilities  and other operating expense categories 
value added services amounts in s revenues    rent and purchased transportation expense    gross margin    other operating expenses    operating income   compared to operating revenues operating revenues increased in compared to excluding fuel surcharge revenues  trucking revenues increased due primarily to a increase in revenue per total mile  excluding fuel surcharges  and a increase in the average number of tractors in service 
revenue per total mile  excluding fuel surcharges  increased due to customer rate increases  an improvement in freight selection  and a decrease in the average loaded trip length due to growth in the company s dedicated fleet 
part of the growth in the dedicated fleet was offset by a decrease in the company s medium to long haul van fleet 
dedicated fleet business tends to have lower miles per trip  a higher empty mile percentage  a higher rate per loaded mile  and lower miles per truck 
the growth in dedicated business had a corresponding effect on these same operating statistics  as reported above  for the entire company 
during  the truckload freight environment continued to strengthen due to ongoing truck capacity constraints and a steadily improving economy 
beginning in august  the company s sales and marketing team met with customers to negotiate annual rate increases to recoup the significant cost increases in fuel  driver pay  equipment  and insurance and to improve margins 
much of the company s non dedicated contractual business renewed in the latter part of third quarter and fourth quarter 
as a result of these efforts  revenue per total mile  net of fuel surcharges  rose seven cents a mile  or  sequentially from second quarter to fourth quarter fuel surcharge revenues  which represent collections from customers for the higher cost of fuel  increased to million in from million in due to higher average fuel prices in to lessen the effect of fluctuating fuel prices on the company s margins  the company collects fuel surcharge revenues from its customers 
these surcharge programs  which automatically adjust depending on the doe weekly retail on highway diesel prices  continued in effect throughout the company s fuel surcharge program has historically enabled the company to recover a significant portion of the fuel price increases 
typical programs specify a base price per gallon when surcharges can begin to be billed 
above this price  the company bills a surcharge rate per mile when the price per gallon falls in a bracketed range of fuel prices 
when fuel prices increase  fuel surcharges recoup a lower percentage of the incrementally higher costs due to the impact of inadequate recovery for empty miles not billable to customers  out of route miles  truck idle time  and bracket creep 
bracket creep occurs when fuel prices approach the upper limit of the bracketed range  but a higher surcharge rate per mile cannot be billed until the fuel price per gallon reaches the next bracket 
also  the doe survey price used for surcharge contracts changes once a week while fuel prices change more frequently 
because collections of fuel surcharges typically trail fuel price changes  rapid fuel price increases cause a temporarily unfavorable effect of fuel prices increasing more rapidly than fuel surcharge revenues 
this effect typically reverses when fuel prices fall 
vas revenues increased to million in from million in  or  and gross margin increased for the same period 
most of this revenue growth came from the company s brokerage group within vas 
vas revenues consist primarily of freight brokerage  intermodal  freight transportation management  and other services 
during  the expansion of the company s vas services assisted customers by providing needed capacity while driving cost out of their freight network 
the company expects to continue to capitalize on the sophisticated service  management  and technology advantages of its logistics solution in an improving freight market 
during  vas is expanding its service offerings to include multimodal 
multimodal provides for the movement of freight using a blending of truck and rail intermodal service solutions 
operating expenses the company s operating ratio was in versus in because the company s vas business operates with a lower operating margin and a higher return on assets than the trucking business  the substantial growth in vas business in compared to affected the company s overall operating ratio 
as explained on page  the significant increase in fuel expense and related fuel surcharge revenues also affected the operating ratio 
the tables on page show the operating ratios and operating margins for the company s two reportable segments  truckload transportation services and value added services 
the following table sets forth the cost per total mile of operating expense items for the truckload transportation services segment for the periods indicated 
the company evaluates operating costs for this segment on a per mile basis to adjust for the impact on the percentage of total operating revenues caused by changes in fuel surcharge revenues and rate per mile increases  which provides a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period

owner operator costs are included in rent and purchased transportation expense 
owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles were in compared to in owner operators are independent contractors who supply their own tractor and driver and are responsible for their operating expenses including fuel  supplies and maintenance  and fuel taxes 
because the change in owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles was only minimal  there was essentially no shift in costs to the rent and purchased transportation category from other expense categories 
over the past year  attracting and retaining owner operator drivers continued to be difficult due to the challenging operating conditions 
salaries  wages and benefits for non drivers increased in compared to to support the growth in the vas segment 
the increase in salaries  wages and benefits per mile of cents for the truckload transportation services segment is primarily the result of higher driver pay per mile 
on august   the company s previously announced two cent per mile pay raise became effective for company solo drivers in its medium to long haul van division  representing approximately of total drivers 
the company recovered a substantial portion of this pay raise through its customer rate increase negotiations 
as a result of the new hours of service regulations effective at the beginning of  the company increased driver pay in the non dedicated fleets for multiple stop shipments 
additional revenue from increased rates per stop offset most of the increased driver pay 
the increase in dedicated business as a percentage of total trucking business also contributed to the increase in driver pay per mile as dedicated drivers are usually compensated at a higher rate per mile due to the lower average miles per truck 
the company s dedicated fleets also typically have higher amounts of loading unloading pay and minimum pay 
in recent months  the market for recruiting experienced drivers has tightened 
the company experienced initial improvement in driver turnover after announcing the two cent per mile pay raise that became effective in august  however  that improvement has been difficult to sustain in recent months 
alternative jobs with an improving economy  weak population demographics  and competitor pay raises are expected to keep the driver market challenging 
the company is expanding its student driver training program to attract more drivers to the company and the industry 
the company is also offering an increasing percentage of driving jobs with more frequent home time in its dedicated  regional  and network optimization fleets 
the company instituted an optional per diem reimbursement program for eligible company drivers approximately half of total non student company drivers beginning in april this program increases a company driver s net pay per mile  after taxes 
as a result  driver pay per mile was slightly lower before considering the factors above that increased driver pay per mile  and the company s effective income tax rate was higher in compared to the company expects the cost of the per diem program to be neutral  because the combined driver pay rate per mile and per diem reimbursement under the per diem program is about one cent per mile lower than mileage pay without per diem reimbursement  which offsets the company s increased income taxes caused by the nondeductible portion of the per diem 
the per diem program increases driver satisfaction through higher net pay per mile  after taxes 
the company anticipates that the competition for qualified drivers will continue to be high and cannot predict whether it will experience shortages in the future 
if such a shortage were to occur and additional increases in driver pay rates became necessary to attract and retain drivers  the company s results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that corresponding freight rate increases were not obtained 
fuel increased cents per mile for the truckload transportation services segment due primarily to higher average diesel fuel prices 
average fuel prices in were cents a gallon  or  higher than in fuel expense  after considering the amounts collected from customers through fuel surcharge programs  net of reimbursement to owner operators  had an eight cent negative impact on earnings per share compared to earnings per share 
in addition to the increase in fuel prices  company data continues to indicate that the fuel mile per gallon mpg degradation for trucks with post october engines of the company owned truck fleet as of december  is a reduction of approximately 
as the company continues to replace older trucks in its fleet with trucks with the post october engines  fuel cost per mile is expected to increase due to the lower mpg 
shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices  or rationing of petroleum products can have a materially adverse effect on the operations and profitability of the company 
the company is unable to predict whether fuel price levels will continue to increase or decrease in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges will be collected from customers 
as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
diesel fuel prices for the first six weeks of averaged cents a gallon  or higher than average fuel prices for first quarter based on current fuel price trends for the first six weeks of and assuming fuel prices remain at current levels for the remainder of first quarter  the company expects that fuel will have a minimal impact on first quarter earnings compared to first quarter earnings 
supplies and maintenance for the truckload transportation services segment increased cents on a per mile basis in due primarily to increases in the cost of over the road repairs and an increase in maintenance on equipment sales related to a larger number of tractors sold through the company s fleet truck sales subsidiary in versus over the road otr repairs increased as a result of the increase in dedicated fleet trucks  which typically do not have as much maintenance performed at company terminals 
the company includes the higher cost of otr maintenance in its dedicated pricing models 
higher driver recruiting costs including driver advertising and driver travel and lodging also contributed to a small portion of the increase 
insurance and claims for the truckload transportation services segment increased cents on a per mile basis  primarily related to liability claims 
cargo claims expense was essentially flat on a per mile basis compared to the company renewed its liability insurance policies for coverage up to million per claim on august  effective august   the company became responsible for the first million per claim previously  per claim 
see item legal proceedings for information on the company s coverage levels for personal injury and property damage since august  the increased company retention from  to million is due to changes in the trucking insurance market and is similar to increased claim retention levels experienced by other truckload carriers 
liability insurance premiums for the policy year beginning august  decreased approximately million due to the higher retention level 
the company is unable to predict whether the trend of increasing insurance and claims expense will continue in the future 
depreciation expense for the truckload transportation services segment increased cents on a per mile basis in due primarily to higher costs of new tractors with the post october engines 
as the company continues to replace older trucks in its fleet with trucks with the post october engines  depreciation expense is expected to increase 
rent and purchased transportation consists mainly of payments to third party carriers in the vas and other non trucking operations and payments to owner operators in the trucking operations 
rent and purchased transportation for the truckload transportation services segment increased cents per total mile as higher fuel prices necessitated higher reimbursements to owner operators for fuel 
the company s customer fuel surcharge programs do not differentiate between miles generated by company owned trucks and miles generated by owner operator trucks  thus  the increase in owner operator fuel reimbursements is included with company fuel expenses in calculating the per share impact of higher fuel prices on earnings 
the company has experienced difficulty recruiting and retaining owner operators for over two years because of challenging operating conditions 
however  the company has historically been able to add company owned tractors and recruit additional company drivers to offset any decreases in owner operators 
if a shortage of owner operators and company drivers were to occur and increases in per mile settlement rates became necessary to attract and retain owner operators  the company s results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that corresponding freight rate increases were not obtained 
payments to third party carriers used for portions of shipments delivered to or from mexico and by a few dedicated fleets in the truckload segment contributed cents of the total per mile increase for the truckload transportation services segment 
as shown in the vas statistics table under the results of operations heading on page  rent and purchased transportation expense for the vas segment increased in response to higher vas revenues 
these expenses generally vary depending on changes in the volume of services generated by the segment 
as a percentage of vas revenues  vas rent and purchased transportation expense decreased to in compared to in  resulting in a higher gross margin in an improving truckload freight environment in resulted in improved customer rates for the vas segment 
additionally  to support the ongoing growth within vas  the group has increased its number of approved third party providers 
this larger carrier base allows vas to more competitively match customer freight with available capacity  resulting in improved margins 
other operating expenses for the truckload transportation services segment decreased cents per mile in gains on sales of revenue equipment  primarily trucks  are reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses and were million in compared to million in in  the company sold about three fourths of its used trucks to third parties and traded about one fourth 
in  the company sold about two thirds of its used trucks and traded about one third 
gains increased due to a larger number of trucks sold in  with a lower average gain per truck 
in july  the company also began recording gains on certain tractor trades in accordance with eitf in   and the first six months of  the excess of the trade price over the net book value of the trucks exchanged reduced the cost basis of new trucks 
this change did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company s wholly owned used truck retail network  fleet truck sales  is one of the largest class truck sales entities in the united states  with locations  and has been in operation since fleet truck sales continues to be a resource for the company to remarket its used trucks 
other operating expenses also include bad debt expense and professional service fees 
the company incurred approximately million in professional fees in in connection with the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act of the company recorded essentially no interest expense in  as it repaid its last remaining debt in december interest income for the company increased to million in from million in due to higher average cash balances in compared to the company s effective income tax rate income taxes expressed as a percentage of income before income taxes increased from in to in  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
the income tax rate increased in because of higher non deductible expenses for tax purposes related to the implementation of a per diem pay program for student drivers in fourth quarter and a per diem pay program for eligible company drivers in april the company expects its effective income tax rate in to increase to or higher 
compared to operating revenues operating revenues increased over  due primarily to a increase in the average number of tractors in service 
additionally  revenue per total mile  excluding fuel surcharges  increased primarily due to customer rate increases and better freight mix 
a better freight market and tightening truck capacity contributed to the improvement  compared to the weaker freight market of fuel surcharges  which represent collections from customers for the higher cost of fuel  increased from million in to million in due to higher average fuel prices during see fuel explanation below 
excluding fuel surcharge revenues  trucking revenues increased over the revenue increases described above were offset by a decline in average miles per tractor and a shorter average length of haul due to growth in the company s regional and dedicated fleets from of the fleet at december to of the fleet at december vas revenues increased million to million compared to during the latter part of and continuing into  the company expanded its brokerage and intermodal service offerings by adding senior management and developing new computer systems 
these less asset intensive businesses generally have a lower operating margin and a higher return on assets than the company s truckload business 
freight demand began to improve in march of as compared to the same period in  and continued to be consistently better for most of the last ten months of compared to the corresponding period in the company believes much of the improvement was achieved by execution of the company s plan of limited fleet growth  maintenance of a diversified freight base that emphasizes consumer nondurable goods  and the shift from non dedicated to dedicated trucks discussed below 
the company s empty mile percentage increased from to  which is due in part to a shorter length of haul and a change in the mix of trucks to the dedicated fleet from the medium to long haul van fleet 
werner s dedicated services fleet provides truckload services required for a specific company  their plants  or their distribution centers 
werner grew its dedicated fleet from about one quarter of its total truck fleet at the end of to about one third of its total truck fleet at the end of  with much of this growth occurring in the fourth quarter of since the company s overall truck fleet grew trucks  the truck growth in the dedicated fleet was offset by a reduction in the company s medium to long haul van fleet 
dedicated fleet business tends to have lower miles per trip  a higher empty mile percentage  a higher rate per loaded mile  and lower miles per truck per month 
the growth in dedicated business has had a corresponding effect on these same operating statistics for the entire company 
operating expenses the company s operating ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues improved from in to in conversely  the company s operating margin improved from in to in operating expenses  when expressed as a percentage of total revenues  were lower in versus because of the higher revenue per mile and fuel surcharge revenue per mile 
owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles were in compared to in this decrease in owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles shifted costs from the rent and purchased transportation category to other expense categories 
the company estimates that rent and purchased transportation expense for the truckload transportation segment was lower by approximately cents per total mile due to this decrease  and other expense categories had offsetting increases on a total mile basis  as follows salaries  wages and benefits cents  fuel cents  supplies and maintenance cents  taxes and licenses cents  and depreciation cents 
during  it continued to be difficult to attract and retain owner operator drivers due to challenging operating conditions 
the following table sets forth the cost per total mile of operating expense items for the truckload transportation services segment for the periods indicated 
the company evaluates operating costs for this segment on a per mile basis to adjust for the impact on the percentage of total operating revenues caused by changes in fuel surcharge revenues and rate per mile increases  which provides a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period

salaries  wages and benefits including driver and non driver costs for the truckload transportation services segment increased cents per mile due primarily to growth in the percentage of company owned trucks to total trucks from at the end of to at the end of and an increase in the number of salaried drivers 
the market for attracting and retaining company drivers continued to be challenging and became even more difficult in the fourth quarter of while the market for recruiting qualified drivers tightened  the company continued to have success recruiting drivers from driver training schools 
salaries  wages and benefits includes expenses for workers compensation benefits 
the related accrued claims for workers compensation are reflected in insurance and claims accruals in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
effective july  the company changed its monthly mileage bonus pay program for van solo company drivers  which represented approximately one third of the company s total drivers 
the goal was to increase driver miles per truck by rewarding higher production from van solo drivers with higher pay 
the monthly mileage bonus pay increased by an average of  per month during the last six months of fuel increased cents per total mile for the truckload transportation services segment due to higher fuel prices 
the average price per gallon of diesel fuel  excluding fuel taxes  was approximately 
per gallon  or  higher in versus the company s customer fuel surcharge reimbursement programs have historically enabled the company to recover from its customers much of the higher fuel prices compared to normalized average fuel prices 
after considering the amounts collected from customers through fuel surcharge programs  net of company reimbursements to owner operators  earnings per share were not impacted by the higher fuel expense 
earnings per share were negatively impacted by 
per share in first quarter  positively impacted by 
and 
per share in the second and third quarters  respectively  and not impacted in fourth quarter approximately of the company s fleet consisted of trucks with the less fuel efficient post october engines as of december  as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
supplies and maintenance for the truckload transportation services segment increased only cents per total mile due primarily to improved management of maintenance expenses  offset slightly by the growth in the percentage of company owned trucks to total trucks 
insurance and claims increased cents per total mile due to an increase in the frequency and severity of claims  increased retention levels for claims  a higher cost per claim  and higher premiums for catastrophic liability coverage 
the company s premium rate for liability coverage up to million per claim was fixed through july   while coverage levels above million per claim were renewed effective august  for a one year period 
for the policy year beginning august  the company s total premiums for liability insurance increased by approximately million 
this increase includes premiums for terrorism coverage 
see item legal proceedings for information on the company s coverage levels for personal injury and property damage since august  rent and purchased transportation for the truckload transportation services segment decreased cents per total mile in due to a decrease in payments to owner operators 
the decrease in payments to owner operators resulted from the decrease in owner operator miles as a percentage of total company miles as discussed previously  offset by higher fuel surcharge reimbursements paid to owner operators due to higher average fuel prices 
the company has experienced difficulty recruiting and retaining owner operators because of challenging operating conditions 
this has resulted in a reduction in the number of owner operator tractors from  as of december   to as of december  the company reimburses owner operators for the higher cost of fuel based on fuel surcharge reimbursements collected from customers 
the increase in rent and purchased transportation for the vas segment corresponded to the higher non trucking revenues  as shown in the vas statistics table under the results of operations heading on page other operating expenses decreased cents per mile due primarily to an increase in the resale value of the company s used trucks 
because of truckload carrier concerns with new truck engines and lower industry production of new trucks  the resale value of the company s premium used trucks improved 
in  the company traded about one half of its used trucks and sold about one half of its used trucks and realized gains of million 
in  the company traded about one third of its used trucks and sold about two thirds to third parties 
in  due to a higher average sales price  and gain  per truck  the company realized gains of million 
for trucks traded  the excess of the trade price over the net book value of the trucks reduces the cost basis of new trucks  and therefore results in lower depreciation expense over the life of the asset 
other operating expenses also include bad debt expense and professional service fees 
interest expense for the company decreased from million in to million in due to a reduction in the company s borrowings 
average debt outstanding in was million 
in  outstanding debt totaled million throughout most of the year  until the company repaid its only remaining debt in december the company s effective income tax rate was in and  respectively  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in cash flow from operations decreased million in compared to  or 
this decrease was due to lower truck purchases in  which caused higher tax payments due to lower tax depreciation and resulted in a smaller payable for tractors received at year end 
returning to a normal tractor replacement cycle in resulted in increased cash flow from operations of million in over  or 
the cash flow from operations enabled the company to make capital expenditures and repay debt as discussed below 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in  and million in the increase million from to and decrease million from to were due primarily to the company s accelerated purchases of tractors with pre october engines in the latter part of and purchasing fewer tractors in the engine emission standards that became effective october  did not allow the company sufficient time to test a significant sample of the new engines 
this prompted the company to purchase a large number of trucks with engines manufactured prior to october  which are not subject to the new engine emission standards  in addition to the normal number of new trucks required for the company s three year replacement cycle 
this enabled the company to delay the impact of using trucks with new engines in its fleet by approximately one year and allowed additional time for testing 
the pre buy trucks were gradually placed in service throughout  with the last group of these trucks being placed into service during the third quarter of as of december   approximately of the company owned truck fleet consisted of trucks with the new engines 
the company intends to gradually reduce the average age of the truck fleet in as such  capital expenditures are expected to be higher in compared to as of december   the company has committed to property and equipment purchases  net of trades  of approximately million 
the company intends to fund these capital expenditure commitments through existing cash on hand and cash flow from operations 
net financing activities used million in  million in  and million in in and  the company made net repayments of debt of million and million  respectively 
the company repaid its last remaining debt in december the company paid dividends of million in  million in  and million in the company increased its quarterly dividend rate by per share beginning with the dividend paid in july financing activities also included common stock repurchases of million in  million in  and million in from time to time  the company has repurchased  and may continue to repurchase  shares of its common stock 
the timing and amount of such purchases depends on market and other factors 
the company s board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to  shares 
as of december   the company had purchased  shares pursuant to this authorization and had  shares remaining available for repurchase 
management believes the company s financial position at december  is strong 
as of december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents  no debt  and million of stockholders equity 
as of december   the company had no equipment operating leases  and therefore  had no off balance sheet equipment debt 
based on the company s strong financial position  management foresees no significant barriers to obtaining sufficient financing  if necessary 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december   the company had no debt outstanding 
the following table sets forth the company s credit facilities and purchase commitments as of december  amount of commitment expiration per period in millions total other commercial amounts less than over commitments committed year years years years unused lines of credit standby letters of credit other commercial commitments total commercial commitments the company has two credit facilities with banks totaling million on which no borrowings were outstanding 
the credit available under these facilities is reduced by the amount of standby letters of credit the company maintains 
the unused lines of credit are available to the company in the event the company needs financing for the growth of its fleet 
with the company s strong financial position  the company expects it could obtain additional financing  if necessary  at favorable terms 
the standby letters of credit are primarily required for insurance policies 
the other commercial commitments relate to committed equipment expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any arrangements which meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement 
critical accounting policies the company s success depends on its ability to efficiently manage its resources in the delivery of truckload transportation and logistics services to its customers 
resource requirements vary with customer demand  which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions 
the company s ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is a key element in efficiently deploying resources and in making capital investments in tractors and trailers 
although the company s business volume is not highly concentrated  the company may also be affected by the financial failure of its customers or a loss of a customer s business from time to time 
the company s most significant resource requirements are qualified drivers  tractors  trailers  and related costs of operating its equipment such as fuel and related fuel taxes  driver pay  insurance  and supplies and maintenance 
the company has historically been successful mitigating its risk to increases in fuel prices by recovering additional fuel surcharges from its customers 
the company s financial results are also affected by availability of drivers and the market for new and used trucks 
because the company is self insured for cargo  personal injury  and property damage claims on its trucks and for workers compensation benefits for its employees supplemented by premium based coverage above certain dollar levels  financial results may also be affected by driver safety  medical costs  the weather  the legal and regulatory environment  and the costs of insurance coverage to protect against catastrophic losses 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect our financial statements include the following selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers range from to years 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sale for example  three years for tractors are based on the expected market values of equipment at the time of disposal 
although the company s current replacement cycle for tractors is three years  the company calculates depreciation expense for financial reporting purposes using a five year life and salvage value 
depreciation expense calculated in this manner continues at the same straight line rate  which approximates the continuing declining market value of the tractors  in those instances in which a tractor is held beyond the normal three year age 
calculating depreciation expense using a five year life and salvage value results in the same annual depreciation rate of cost per year and the same net book value at the normal three year replacement date of cost as using a three year life and salvage value 
the company continually monitors the adequacy of the lives and salvage values used in calculating depreciation expense and adjusts these assumptions appropriately when warranted 
the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable  and it exceeds its fair value 
for long lived assets classified as held and used  if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the sum of the future net cash flows  it is not recoverable 
the company does not separately identify assets by operating segment  as tractors and trailers are routinely transferred from one operating fleet to another 
as a result  none of the company s long lived assets have identifiable cash flows from use that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
thus  the asset group used to assess impairment would include all assets and liabilities of the company 
long lived assets classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
estimates of accrued liabilities for insurance and claims for liability and physical damage losses and workers compensation 
the insurance and claims accruals current and long term are recorded at the estimated ultimate payment amounts and are based upon individual case estimates  including negative development  and estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past experience 
the company s self insurance reserves are reviewed by an actuary every six months 
policies for revenue recognition 
operating revenues including fuel surcharge revenues and related direct costs are recorded when the shipment is delivered 
for shipments where a third party provider is utilized to provide some or all of the service and the company is the primary obligor in regards to the delivery of the shipment  establishes customer pricing separately from carrier rate negotiations  generally has discretion in carrier selection  and or has credit risk on the shipment  the company records both revenues for the dollar value of services billed by the company to the customer and rent and purchased transportation expense for the costs of transportation paid by the company to the third party provider upon delivery of the shipment 
in the absence of the conditions listed above  the company records revenues net of expenses related to third party providers 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required to determine the provision for income taxes and to determine whether deferred income taxes will be realized in full or in part 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
when it is more likely that all or some portion of specific deferred income tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets has not been deemed to be necessary due to the company s profitable operations 
accordingly  if the facts or financial circumstances were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred income tax assets  judgment would need to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
together with the effects of the matters discussed above  these factors may significantly impact the company s results of operations from period to period 
inflation inflation can be expected to have an impact on the company s operating costs 
a prolonged period of inflation could cause interest rates  fuel  wages  and other costs to increase and could adversely affect the company s results of operations unless freight rates could be increased correspondingly 
however  the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years 
forward looking statements and risk factors the following risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements included in this form k the company s business is modestly seasonal with peak freight demand occurring generally in the months of september  october  and november 
during the winter months  the company s freight volumes are typically lower as some customers have lower shipment levels after the christmas holiday season 
the company s operating expenses have historically been higher in winter months primarily due to decreased fuel efficiency  increased maintenance costs of revenue equipment in colder weather  and increased insurance and claims costs due to adverse winter weather conditions 
the company attempts to minimize the impact of seasonality through its marketing program by seeking additional freight from certain customers during traditionally slower shipping periods 
bad weather  holidays  and the number of business days during the period can also affect revenue  since revenue is directly related to available working days of shippers 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of trucking companies 
the company estimates the ten largest truckload carriers have less than ten percent of the approximate billion market targeted by the company 
this competition could limit the company s growth opportunities and reduce its profitability 
the company competes primarily with other truckload carriers 
railroads  less than truckload carriers  and private carriers also provide competition  but to a much lesser degree 
competition for the freight transported by the company is based primarily on service and efficiency and  to some degree  on freight rates alone 
the company is sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact customer shipping volumes 
the general slowdown in the economy in and had a negative effect on freight volumes for truckload carriers  including the company 
beginning in and continuing throughout  general economic improvements lead to improved freight demand for the company year over year 
as the unemployment rate increased during and  driver availability improved for the company and the industry but became more difficult beginning in fourth quarter and continuing through due to pending concerns in the middle east and other factors  fuel prices began to rise in the second quarter of  continued to increase throughout the second half of  and increased further in the first part of in the last nine months of  prices decreased again  ending at prices slightly higher than at the end of in  fuel prices  excluding fuel taxes  climbed steadily throughout most of the year  before decreasing in december to prices about higher than at the end of shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices  or rationing of petroleum products can have a materially adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the company 
to the extent that the company cannot recover the higher cost of fuel through customer fuel surcharges  the company s results would be negatively impacted 
future economic conditions that may affect the company include employment levels  business conditions  fuel and energy costs  interest rates  and tax rates 
the company is regulated by the dot and the federal and provincial transportation departments in canada 
these regulatory authorities establish broad powers  generally governing activities such as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety  financial reporting  and other matters 
the company may become subject to new or more comprehensive regulations relating to fuel emissions  driver hours of service  or other issues mandated by the dot  epa  or the federal and provincial transportation departments in canada 
for example  new engine emissions standards became effective for truck engine manufacturers in october the new hours of service regulations that became effective on january  were vacated in their entirety by the united states circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia and remanded to the fmcsa for reconsideration 
on september   the extension of the federal highway bill signed into law by the president extended the current hours of service rules for one year or whenever the fmcsa develops a new set of regulations  whichever comes first 
on january   the fmcsa re proposed its april hos rules  adding references to how the rules would affect driver health  but making no changes to the regulations 
the fmcsa is seeking public comments by march  on what changes to the rule  if any  are necessary to respond to the concerns raised by the court  and to provide data or studies that would support changes to  or continued use of  the rule 
the company cannot predict what rule changes  if any  will result from the court s ruling  nor the ultimate impact of any upcoming changes to the hours of service rules 
any changes could have an adverse effect on the operations and profitability of the company 
at times  there have been shortages of drivers in the trucking industry 
the market for recruiting drivers became more difficult in fourth quarter and continued throughout during the last several years  it was more difficult to recruit and retain owner operator drivers due to challenging operating conditions  including high fuel prices 
the company anticipates that the competition for company drivers and owner operator drivers will continue to be high and cannot predict whether it will experience shortages in the future 
the company is highly dependent on the services of key personnel including clarence l 
werner and other executive officers 
although the company believes it has an experienced and highly qualified management group  the loss of the services of these executive officers could have a material adverse impact on the company and its future profitability 
the company is dependent on its vendors and suppliers 
the company believes it has good relationships with its vendors and that it is generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors and suppliers 
if the company fails to maintain good relationships with its vendors and suppliers or if its vendors and suppliers experience significant financial problems  the company could face difficulty in obtaining needed goods and services because of interruptions of production or for other reasons  which could adversely affect the company s business 
the efficient operation of the company s business is highly dependent on its information systems 
much of the company s software has been developed internally or by adapting purchased software applications to the company s needs 
the company has purchased redundant computer hardware systems and has its own off site disaster recovery facility approximately ten miles from the company s offices to use in the event of a disaster 
the company has taken these steps to reduce the risk of disruption to its business operation if a disaster were to occur 
the company self insures for liability resulting from cargo loss  personal injury  and property damage as well as workers compensation 
this is supplemented by premium insurance with licensed insurance companies above the company s self insurance level for each type of coverage 
to the extent the company were to experience a significant increase in the number of claims  the cost per claim  or the costs of insurance premiums for coverage in excess of its retention amounts  the company s operating results would be negatively affected 
in  the company was named a defendant in two lawsuits related to an accident involving a third party carrier that was transporting a shipment arranged by the company s vas division  as described under item of this form k 
to the extent the company were to experience more of these types of claims and the company is held responsible for liability for these types of claims  the company s results of operations could be negatively impacted 
effective october   all newly manufactured truck engines must comply with the engine emission standards mandated by the epa 
as of december   approximately of the company owned truck fleet consisted of trucks with the new post october engines 
the company has experienced an approximate reduction in fuel efficiency to date and increased depreciation expense due to the higher cost of the new engines 
the company anticipates continued increases in these expense categories as regular truck replacements increase the percentage of company owned trucks with new post october engines 
a new set of more stringent emissions standards mandated by the epa will become effective for newly manufactured trucks beginning in january the company intends to gradually reduce the average age of its truck fleet in advance of the new standards 
the company expects that the engines produced under the standards will be less fuel efficient and have a higher cost than the current engines 
the company is unable to predict the impact these new regulations will have on its operations  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the company is sensitive to changes in used equipment prices  especially tractors 
because of truckload carrier concerns with new truck engines and lower industry production of new trucks over the last several years  the resale value of werner s premium used trucks improved from the historically low values of gains on sales of equipment are reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses in the company s income statement and amounted to gains of million in  million in  and million in caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements made herein  since the statements speak only as of the date they are made 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forward looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest and exchange rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk the company had no debt outstanding at december  interest rates on the company s unused credit facilities are based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
increases in interest rates could impact the company s annual interest expense on future borrowings 
commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather  and other market factors 
historically  the company has been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the company cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts business in mexico and canada 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to the company s results of operations for and prior years 
accordingly  the company is not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on the company s future costs or on future cash flows 
to date  all foreign revenues are denominated in us dollars  and the company receives payment for freight services performed in mexico and canada primarily in us dollars to reduce foreign currency risk
