item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the leading food distribution and retail companies in the united states  with approximately billion in annual sales 
approximately of our sales come from our food distribution segment  which sells and distributes a wide variety of nationally branded and private label grocery products from distribution centers to more than  grocery stores and other customers located in states  primarily in the midwest and southeast 
approximately of our annual sales come from our military food distribution segment  which contracts with vendors to distribute a wide variety of grocery products to military commissaries and military distribution centers supporting over military commissaries located primarily in the mid atlantic region of the united states  and in europe  cuba  puerto rico  iceland  the azores and honduras 
the remaining of our annual sales come from our retail segment  which operates corporate owned stores primarily in the upper midwest 
our food distribution and retail businesses operate in intensely competitive industries  characterized by low profit margins and increasing consolidation 
alternative store formats  such as supercenters  warehouse clubs and extreme value food stores  have gained and continue to gain market share at the expense of conventional grocery stores  which represent the substantial majority of our corporate owned stores as well as of our independent retail customer base 
largely as a result of this trend  over the three years discussed in this report we have experienced decreasing same store sales in our retail segment and  to a lesser degree  attrition among the existing customer base in our food distribution segment 
despite these competitive pressures  our annual sales over this three year period have been relatively flat as a result of new business gained by our food distribution and military distribution businesses 
in fiscal  our food distribution sales increased over the year earlier primarily as a result of new customer accounts 
excluding the effect of the rd week in fiscal year  food distribution sales grew over the year earlier 
we believe that additional business opportunities will continue to be available to our food distribution segment from additional sales opportunities with our current customer base  former customers of fleming and other wholesalers  independent operators who purchase stores from major retailers seeking to rationalize their markets and retailers adding food to their product offerings 
the degree to which we are able to continue to capitalize on these opportunities will determine the degree to which new business gains can exceed customer attrition  which has historically ranged from two to four percent 
our military food distribution segment continues to experience solid year over year sales growth 
this was driven by higher sales to military bases both overseas and in the us we believe that our excellent reputation with deca has helped us win new business 
the segment has continued to capitalize on increased profitability in fiscal as a result of continued efficiencies gained through the consolidation of two large distribution centers in fiscal we believe we are well positioned to continue to benefit from this consolidation as well as attain further revenue growth through expansion of our customer base and extension of our product offerings 
our retail segment continued to be negatively affected by increasing competition  primarily from the growth of alternative store formats that have gained market share at the expense of conventional stores 
during the second quarter of  we completed a strategic review that identified certain retail stores that did not meet return objectives  provide long term strategic opportunities or justify additional capital investments 
as a result of this review  we closed retail stores at the end of the second quarter and are currently seeking purchasers for our three denver area avanza stores 
exiting these underperforming assets is consistent with our commitment to continue to lower operating costs  improve our balance sheet and focus investment and attention on core areas of our business 
we believe that the closure and sale of these stores  as well as the closure of six additional stores during  will benefit our retail segment by enabling us to focus on a variety of retail initiatives  such as improvements in merchandising and pricing strategies  store level execution  and perishable offerings and quality 
during  we reduced total debt including capital lease obligations by million as part of a continuing effort to reduce the company s leverage  and we believe that doing so reduces the risk profile of the company 
on november  we concluded the refinancing of our senior secured bank credit facility which had been scheduled to mature on december  on december   we redeemed the million in senior subordinated notes due at a redemption price of using proceeds from the new senior secured bank facility 
in february  our board increased our quarterly dividend from per share to per share 
with the exception of temporary draws on our revolving credit line to build inventories for certain holidays during the year  we expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to enable us to further reduce our debt during reducing dependence on debt also frees up borrowing capacity to enable us to take advantage of potential acquisition or investment opportunities that present themselves 
results of operations the following discussion summarizes our operating results for fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal however  fiscal and results are not directly comparable to fiscal because fiscal contained an additional week 
sales the following tables summarize our sales activity for fiscal  and segment sales sales percent of sales percent change sales percent of sales percent change sales percent of sales food distribution military retail total sales the following table summarizes the impact on company and segment sales of the additional week in the fourth fiscal quarter of adjusted fiscal sales for the effect of an additional week of sales segment sales sales rd week sales comparable weeks of sales comparable percent change to food distribution military retail total sales the increase in food distribution sales in fiscal and fiscal was due to new business with former fleming customers and other new accounts 
partially offsetting the fiscal increase were reduced sales and store closings by certain of our independent retail customers because of increased competition in their respective markets 
the increase in military segment sales in fiscal and was due to increased shipments throughout the domestic commissary system and overseas 
approximately of the decrease in retail sales in fiscal is attributable to the previously discussed store closures during  with the balance reflecting negative same store sales 
same store sales  which compare retail sales for stores which were in operation for the same number of weeks in the comparative periods  decreased for as compared to these declines continue to reflect a difficult competitive environment in which supercenters and other alternative formats compete for price conscious consumers 
the decrease in retail segment sales from fiscal to fiscal primarily reflects a decrease in same store sales 
during fiscal and  our corporate store count changed as follows fiscal year fiscal year number of stores at beginning of year new stores acquired stores closed or sold stores number of stores at end of year gross profit gross profit calculated as sales less cost of sales for fiscal was of sales compared to for fiscal and for fiscal gross profit was negatively impacted in fiscal versus fiscal and in fiscal versus because retail segment sales  which earn a higher gross profit than food distribution and military distribution segment sales  represented a smaller percentage of our total sales 
costs associated with the consolidation of two large warehouse facilities in the military distribution segment reduced gross profit in by million  but completion of the consolidation effort in late benefited the gross profit margin in the military distribution segment during in addition  gross profit comparisons were negatively impacted by a lifo charge of million in fiscal versus credits of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the lifo charge in fiscal was due to food price inflation across all categories of products 
the lifo credits in and were due to food price deflation and decreased inventory levels as a result of lower sales 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we early adopted the provisions of eitf no 
accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  see critical accounting policies vendor allowances and credits below for discussion retroactive to the beginning of fiscal the impact of the adoption on gross profit in fiscal  excluding the cumulative effect adjustment  was an increase of million 
in addition  the adoption resulted in a reclassification of million of net cooperative advertising income from selling  general and administrative expenses to cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for fiscal were of sales as compared to of sales in fiscal and of sales in fiscal sg a expense in dollars and as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was lower because retail segment sales  which have higher sg a expenses than food distribution and military distribution segment sales  represented a smaller percentage of our total sales 
gains on the sale of real estate increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal bad debt expense decreased by million due to improved receivables management 
charges for asset impairments other than those recorded as part of the special charge decreased million from fiscal to  from million to million 
the impairment charges for fiscal and related primarily to three and six stores  respectively  whose carrying values were impaired due to increased competition within the stores respective market areas 
the decrease in sg a expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to several factors 
sg a expenses were reduced in fiscal compared to fiscal because retail segment sales  which have higher sg a expenses than food distribution and military distribution segment sales  represented a smaller percentage of our total sales 
in addition  health insurance expense for fiscal decreased by million  primarily reflecting a decision to eliminate post retirement medical benefits for active non union employees in the fourth quarter 
charges for asset impairments decreased million from fiscal to  from million to million 
the impairment charges for fiscal and related to six and fifteen stores  respectively  whose carrying values were impaired due to increased competition within the stores respective market areas 
partially offsetting these decreases was a decrease of million in gains on the sale of real estate  from million in to million in special charges during the second quarter of  the company completed a strategic review that identified certain retail stores that did not meet return objectives  provide long term strategic opportunities or justify additional capital investments 
consequently  the company announced that it was closing or selling retail outlets 
the company closed stores in the second quarter of and is continuing to market its three denver area avanza stores 
as a result of these store dispositions  the company recorded a pre tax special charge of million which was reflected in the special charge line within the consolidated statements of income  and million of costs reflected in operating earnings  primarily involving inventory markdowns related to the store closures 
the special charge included million for asset impairments including million of goodwill allocated to the stores being sold  million for future lease obligations  million in severance and million in other charges based on management s estimates of fair value of assets  lease subsidies  future payments on exited real estate  lease terminations and other related costs 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we recorded a net reversal of million of the special charge because we were able to settle five leases for less than initially estimated and adjusted the estimate needed on four other properties for which more current market information was available 
we recorded special charges totaling million in fiscal and million offset by million of fiscal charge adjustments in fiscal these charges affected our food distribution and retail segments and were also designed to redirect our technology efforts 
all actions contemplated by the charges are complete 
at january   the remaining accrued liability was million and consisted primarily of lease commitments 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company reversed million and million  respectively of its fiscal and special charges due to agreements reached to settle certain leases for less than what the company had originally estimated 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal decreased by compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the disposal of retail assets as part of the strategic review completed in the second fiscal quarter 
depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal increased by from fiscal  primarily due to the addition of information technology software in fiscal interest expense interest expense for fiscal decreased by compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in average borrowing level from million in to million in partially offsetting the decrease in average borrowing levels was an increase in average interest rate from in to in interest expense for fiscal included million paid to our bondholders and million paid to our bank lenders in the first quarter of as consideration for waivers to extend the deadlines for filing our third quarter form q for fiscal  our form k for fiscal and our first quarter form q for fiscal interest expense for fiscal increased by compared to fiscal  due largely to payment of the waiver fees described above 
apart from the waiver fees  the impact of an increase in our average borrowing rate under the bank credit facility from in fiscal to in fiscal was offset by a decrease in our average borrowing level under that facility  from million in to million in fiscal income tax expense the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in the effective rate from fiscal to fiscal and fiscal to fiscal was due to reductions in income tax expense of million and million recognized in and  respectively  as a result of the resolution of various outstanding state and federal tax issues 
refer to the tax rate table in part ii  item of this report under note income taxes of notes to the consolidated financial statements for the comparative components of these rates 
discontinued operations the gain on discontinued operations of million in fiscal and million in fiscal was a result of the resolution of a contingency associated with the sale of our nash de camp produce growing and marketing subsidiary in fiscal cumulative effect of change in accounting principle we adopted the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor as of the beginning of fiscal the cumulative effect at the beginning of fiscal was a charge of million  net of income taxes of million 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle has been presented in our consolidated statement of income for fiscal see critical accounting polices under the caption vendor allowances and credits and new accounting standards in part ii  item of this report 
net earnings net earnings for the week fiscal were million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the week year and million  or per diluted share  for the week year 
net earnings in each of the three years were affected by a number of events included in the discussion above that affected the comparability of results 
some of the more significant of these events are summarized as follows fifty two weeks ended january  fifty three weeks ended january  fifty two weeks ended december  eps eps eps net earnings from continuing operations as reported items affecting earnings call premium for early redemption of senior subordinated notes q write off of unamortized finance costs and original issuance discount on credit facility and senior subordinated notes q change in estimate of special charge from store dispositions q special charges from store dispositions q  q store closure cost reflected in operations q fees paid to lenders as consideration for bond indenture and credit facility waivers q reduction of health insurance expense q reduction in income tax expense q  q and q cumulative effect of accounting change q liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our capital needs through a combination of internal and external sources 
these sources include cash flow from operations  short term bank borrowings  various types of long term debt and lease and equity financing 
during  we expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and enable us to further reduce our debt  with temporary draws on our revolving credit line needed during the year to build inventories for certain holidays 
longer term  we believe that cash flows from operations  short term bank borrowings  various types of long term debt and lease and equity financing will be adequate to meet our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations 
cash flow from operations decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to costs related to the special charge 
partially offsetting these costs was a decrease in inventory of approximately million  million of which related to the retail store closures 
a rise in accounts receivable from the prior year was offset by an increase in accounts payable 
cash flow from operations increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primary contributors to the increase were increased earnings of million and more efficient receivables management  which resulted in a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
cash used for investing activities decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  mostly due to a decrease in net additions to property  plant and equipment of million in fiscal versus fiscal cash used for investing activities increased slightly in fiscal as compared to fiscal we expect our capital expenditures for fiscal to approximate million excluding acquisitions 
these expenditures are expected to include maintenance projects in our food distribution segment  store maintenance and remodels in our food retailing segment  information system upgrades and other miscellaneous projects across our business 
cash used for financing activities increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million premium paid for early extinguishment of the senior subordinated notes due the million principal balance on the senior subordinated notes was paid during the fourth quarter using proceeds from the new senior secured bank credit facility described below 
cash used for financing activities increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to million used to pay down our revolving bank credit facility 
at january   credit availability under the new bank facility was million 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations as of january   and the expected timing of cash payments related to such obligations in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years over years in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations refer to part ii  item in this report under note long term debt and bank credit facilities in notes to consolidated financial statements and to the discussion of covenant compliance below for additional information regarding long term debt 
lease obligations primarily relate to store locations for our retail segment  as well as store locations subleased to independent food distribution customers 
a discussion of lease commitments can be found in part ii  item in this report under note leases in notes to consolidated financial statements and under the caption lease commitments under critical accounting policies  below 
includes amounts classified as imputed interest 
the majority of our purchase obligations involve purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business  which are not included in the table above 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within very short time horizons 
any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable upon shipment of the underlying product 
the purchase obligations shown in this table also exclude agreements that are cancelable by us without significant penalty  which include contracts for routine outsourced services 
the amount of purchase obligations shown in the table represents the amount of product we are contractually obligated to purchase to earn million in upfront contract monies received 
should we not be able to fulfill these purchase obligations  we would be only obligated to pay back the unearned upfront contract monies 
we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in the contractual obligations table 
as of december  we had a pension funding obligation of million as discussed further in part ii  item in this report under note pension and other post retirement benefits 
we have also made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond these commitments include standby letters of credit and guarantees of certain food distribution customer debt and lease obligations 
the following summarizes these commitments as of january  total commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments amounts committed less than year years years over years in thousands standby letters of credit guarantees total other commercial commitments letters of credit relate primarily to supporting workers compensation obligations and are renewable annually 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements and under the caption guarantees of debt and lease obligations of others under critical accounting policies  below  for additional information regarding debt  lease guarantees and assigned leases 
bank credit agreement on november  we concluded the refinancing of our senior secured bank credit facility which had been scheduled to mature on december  the new credit facility consists of million in revolving credit  all of which may be used for loans and up to million of which may be used for letters of credit  and a million term loan b 
the revolving credit portion of the facility has a five year term and the term loan b has a six year term 
borrowings under the new credit facility are secured by a security interest in substantially all assets of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries that are not pledged under other debt agreements 
proceeds of the term loan b were used to redeem our senior subordinated notes due  as discussed below 
the refinancing and redemption are expected to reduce our annual interest expense  provide us with the ability to continue reducing our debt by structuring our debt in a form that can be prepaid without penalty and provide a more accommodating covenant structure to increase strategic and operating flexibility 
borrowings under the new bank credit facility bear interest at either the eurodollar rate or the prime rate  plus in either case a margin increase that is dependent on our total leverage ratio 
the new credit facility requires us to hedge a certain portion of such borrowings through the use of interest rate swaps  as we have done historically 
we pay a commitment commission on the unused portion of the revolver  but the term loan b was subject to a commitment commission only until the loan was activated 
the margin increase and the commitment commission are reset quarterly based on movement of a leverage ratio defined by the agreement 
at january  the margin for the revolver and term loan b were and  respectively and the commitment commission was 
the margin increase and the commitment commission were and  respectively under the prior credit facility at the end of fiscal the new credit facility represents one of our primary sources of liquidity  both short term and long term  and the continued availability of credit under that facility is of material importance to our ability to fund our capital and working capital needs 
the credit agreement governing the new credit facility contains various restrictive covenants  compliance with which is essential to continued credit availability 
among the most significant of these restrictive covenants are financial covenants which require us to maintain predetermined ratio levels related to interest coverage and leverage 
these ratios are based on ebitda  on a rolling four quarter basis  with some adjustments consolidated ebitda 
consolidated ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is defined in our bank credit agreement as earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  adjusted to exclude extraordinary gains or losses  gains or losses from sales of assets other than inventory in the ordinary course of business  upfront fees and expenses incurred in connection with the execution and delivery of the new credit agreement  and non cash charges such as lifo charges  closed store lease costs and asset impairments  less cash payments made during the current period on non cash charges recorded in prior periods 
consolidated ebitda should not be considered an alternative measure of our net income  operating performance  cash flow or liquidity 
it is provided as additional information relative to compliance with our debt covenants 
in addition  the new credit agreement requires us to maintain predetermined ratio levels related to working capital coverage the ratio of the sum of net trade accounts receivable plus inventory to the sum of loans and letters of credit outstanding under the new credit agreement plus up to million of additional secured indebtedness permitted to be issued under the new credit agreement 
the new credit agreement requires us to maintain an interest coverage ratio of at fiscal year end and increasing to at fiscal year end and thereafter  a leverage ratio of at fiscal year end  stepping down to at fiscal year end and to at fiscal year end and thereafter  and a working capital ratio of at fiscal year end  stepping up to at fiscal year end and to at fiscal year end and thereafter 
we must also maintain a senior secured leverage ratio total unsubordinated secured debt to consolidated ebitda of at fiscal year end  stepping down to at fiscal year end  and to at fiscal year end and thereafter 
as of january   we were in compliance with all financial covenants as defined in our credit agreement which are summarized as follows financial covenant required ratio actual ratio interest coverage ratio minimum leverage ratio maximum senior secured leverage ratio maximum working capital ratio minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters to interest expense for such period 
total outstanding debt to consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters 
total senior secured debt to consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters 
ratio of net trade accounts receivable plus inventory to the sum of loans and letters of credit outstanding under the new credit agreement plus certain additional secured debt 
any failure to comply with any of these financial covenants would constitute an event of default under the bank credit agreement  entitling a majority of the bank lenders to  among other things  terminate future credit availability under the agreement and accelerate the maturity of outstanding obligations under that agreement

redemption of senior subordinated notes on december   we redeemed the million in senior subordinated notes the notes due at a redemption price of  plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes as of the redemption date 
we drew under the term loan b to fund the redemption of these notes 
charges recorded during the fourth fiscal quarter for redemption of the notes and the refinancing of our credit facility included a call premium of million and million for unamortized finance costs and original issue discount charge 
defaults during in february  we were notified by the trustee for our senior subordinated notes that a default had occurred under the related indenture as a result of our failure to file our form q for the third quarter ended october  with the sec 
if the default was not remedied within the day cure period  an event of default would have occurred under the indenture and our bank credit facility 
later that month we obtained a waiver of the default under the indenture  for which we paid a fee to the note holders equal to of the outstanding principal amount of the notes 
in march we obtained an extension of time from our bank lenders to submit to them our audited fiscal financial statements  for which we paid a fee to the bank lenders equal to of the sum of our revolving loan commitments and aggregate outstanding term loans as of the effective date of the extension 
the waiver under the indenture and the extension from the banks were conditioned upon our receiving audited financial statements for fiscal and making specified filings with the sec by specified deadlines 
we subsequently complied with the extended deadlines 
debt obligations generally for debt obligations  the following table presents principal cash flows  related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates and fair value as of january  fixed rate variable rate fair value amount rate fair value amount rate in thousands thereafter derivative instruments we have market risk exposure to changing interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities and commodity price risk associated with anticipated purchases of diesel fuel 
our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates and commodity prices is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
to achieve these objectives  we use derivative instruments  primarily interest rate and commodity swap agreements  to manage risk exposures when appropriate  based on market conditions 
we do not enter into derivative agreements for trading or other speculative purposes  nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
the interest rate swap and commodity swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet and the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income 
deferred gains and losses are amortized as an adjustment to expense over the same period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in income 
however  to the extent that any of these contracts are not considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the change in the value of the items being hedged  any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts are immediately recognized in income 
interest rate swap agreements are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
at january   we had seven outstanding interest rate swap agreements which commenced and expire as follows notional effective date termination date fixed rate at january   we had three outstanding interest rate swap agreements which commenced on july   december  and june   respectively 
those three agreements expired on september   october  and october  with notional amounts of million  million and million  respectively 
the interest rate swap agreements described above totaled million in notional amounts as of january  and million in notional amounts as of january   which amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract 
interest rate swap agreements outstanding at year end and their fair value at that date are summarized as follows in thousands interest rate swaps pay fixed receive variable fair value average receive rate for effective swaps average pay rate for effective swaps we are also using commodity swap agreements to reduce price risk associated with anticipated purchases of diesel fuel 
the outstanding commodity swap agreements hedge approximately of our expected fuel usage for the periods set forth in the swap agreements 
at january   we had two outstanding commodity swap agreements which commenced and expire as follows notional effective date termination date fixed rate  gallons month  gallons month the fair market value of the commodity swaps totaled million as of off balance sheet arrangements as of the date of this report  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our financial statements 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical and could result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions vendor allowances and credits we participate with our vendors in a broad menu of promotions to increase sales of products 
these promotions fall into two main categories off invoice allowances and performance based allowances and are often subject to negotiation with our vendors 
in the case of off invoice allowances  discounts are typically offered by vendors with respect to certain merchandise purchased by us during a specified period of time 
we use off invoice allowances to support a variety of marketing programs such as reduced price offerings for specific time periods  food shows  pallet promotions and private label promotions 
the discounts are either reflected directly on the vendor invoice  as a reduction from the normal wholesale prices for merchandise to which the allowance applies  or we are allowed to deduct the allowance as an offset against the vendor s invoice when it is paid 
in the case of performance based allowances  the allowance or rebate is based on our completion of some specific activity  such as purchasing or selling product during a certain time period 
this basic performance requirement may be accompanied by an additional performance requirement such as providing advertising or special in store promotion  tracking specific shipments of goods to retailers  or to customers in the case of our own retail stores  during a specified period count recount promotions  slotting adding a new item to the system and merchandising a new item  or achieving certain minimum purchase quantities 
the billing for these performance based allowances is normally in the form of a bill back in which case we are invoiced at the regular price with the understanding that we may bill back the vendor for the requisite allowance when the performance is satisfied 
we also assess an administrative fee  reflected on the invoices sent to vendors  to recoup our reasonable costs of performing the tasks associated with administering count recount promotions 
we collectively plan promotions with our vendors and arrive at the amount the respective vendor plans to spend on promotions with us 
each vendor has its own method for determining the amount of promotional funds budgeted to be spent with us during the period 
in most situations  the vendor allowances are based on units we purchased from the vendor 
in other situations  the allowances are based on our past or anticipated purchases and or the anticipated performance of the planned promotions 
forecasting promotional expenditures is a critical part of our twice yearly planning sessions with our vendors 
as individual promotions are completed and the associated billing is processed  the vendors track our promotional program execution and spend rate  and discuss the tracking  performance and spend rate with us on a regular basis throughout the year  variously on a weekly  monthly  quarterly or annual basis 
these communications include future promotions  product cost  targeted retails and price points  anticipated volume  promotion expenditures  vendor maintenance  billing issues and procedures  new items discontinued items  and trade spend levels relative to budget per event and per year  as well as the resolution of any issues that arise between the vendor and us 
in the future  the nature and menu of promotional programs and the allocation of dollars among them may change as a result of ongoing negotiations and commercial relationships between vendors and us 
eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  addresses how a reseller of a vendor s products should account for cash consideration received from a vendor and how to measure that consideration in its income statement 
we early adopted the provisions of eitf no 
at the beginning of fiscal  and recognized a charge of million  net of income taxes of million  that represents the cumulative effect of the deferral of consideration received from vendors as of the beginning of fiscal excluding the cumulative impact  the adoption of eitf no 
on the year ended december  was a decrease in cost of sales of million 
as is common in our industry  we use a third party service to undertake accounts payable audits on an ongoing basis 
these audits examine vendor allowances offered to us during a given year as well as cash discounts  freight allowances and duplicate payments and establish a basis for us to recover overpayments made to vendors 
we reduce future payments to vendors based on the results of these audits  at which time we also establish reserves for commissions payable to the third party service provider as well as for amounts that may not be collected 
although our estimates of reserves do not anticipate changes in our historical payback rates  such changes could have a material impact on our currently recorded reserves 
customer exposure and credit risk allowance for doubtful accounts methodology 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts and notes receivable based on a combination of factors 
in most circumstances when we become aware of factors that may indicate a deterioration in a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  reductions of product purchases  deteriorating store conditions  changes in payment patterns  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
in determining the adequacy of the reserves  we analyze factors such as the value of any collateral  customer financial statements  historical collection experience  aging of receivables and other economic and industry factors 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the collectability based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts 
if circumstances change ie  further evidence of material adverse creditworthiness  additional accounts become credit risks  store closures  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount  including to zero 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note accounts and notes receivable of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these allowances 
lease commitments 
we have historically leased store sites for sublease to qualified independent retailers at rates that are at least as high as the rent paid by us 
under terms of the original lease agreements  we remain primarily liable for any commitments an independent retailer may no longer be financially able to satisfy 
we also lease store sites for our retail segment 
should a retailer be unable to perform under a sublease or should we close underperforming corporate stores  we record a charge to earnings for costs of the remaining term of the lease  less any anticipated sublease income 
calculating the estimated losses requires that significant estimates and judgments be made by management 
our reserves for such properties can be materially affected by factors such as the extent of interested sublessees and their creditworthiness  our ability to negotiate early termination agreements with lessors  and general economic conditions and the demand for commercial property 
should the number of defaults by sublessees or corporate store closures materially increase  the remaining lease commitments we must record could have a material adverse effect on operating results and cash flows 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note leases of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of lease commitments 
guarantees of debt and lease obligations of others 
we have guaranteed the debt and lease obligations of certain of our food distribution customers 
in the event these retailers are unable to meet their debt service payments or otherwise experience an event of default  we would be unconditionally liable for the outstanding balance of their debt and lease obligations million as of january   which would be due in accordance with the underlying agreements 
all of the guarantees were issued prior to december  and therefore were not subject to the recognition and measurement provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requiremetns for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a recission of fasb interpretation no 
fin 
we have also assigned various leases to certain food distribution customers 
if the assignees were to become unable to continue making payments under the assigned leases  we estimate our maximum potential obligation with respect to the assigned leases to be approximately million as of january  in circumstances when we become aware of factors that indicate deterioration in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations guaranteed or assigned by us  we record a specific reserve in the amount we reasonably believe we will be obligated to pay on the customer s behalf  net of any anticipated recoveries from the customer 
in determining the adequacy of these reserves  we analyze factors such as those described above in allowance for doubtful accounts methodology and lease commitments 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the obligations based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts 
triggering these guarantees or obligations under assigned leases would not  however  result in cross default of our debt  but could restrict resources available for general business initiatives 
impairment of long lived assets property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
estimates of future results are often influenced by assessments of changes in competition  merchandising strategies  human resources and general market conditions  which may result in not recognizing an impairment loss 
impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets 
an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount 
we generally determine fair value by discounting expected future cash flows at the rate the company utilizes to evaluate potential investments 
the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the impairment charge 
actual outcomes may differ from the estimates 
income tax assets and liabilities the company provides for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the company s tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
the company is also subject to examination of its income tax returns for multiple years by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
the company periodically assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the impact on its deferred taxes and income tax liabilities and the adequacy of its provision for income taxes 
reserves for self insurance we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  general and automobile liability and health insurance costs 
it is our policy to record our self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
worker s compensation  general and automobile liabilities are actuarially determined on a discounted basis 
we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation  general and automobile and health insurance liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables  such changes could have a material impact on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r revised  share based payment 
the revisions to sfas no require compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
in addition  liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
statement r replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
for public entities  the provisions of the statement are effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june   however early adoption is allowed 
we expect to adopt the provisions of the new statement in the third fiscal quarter of we do not currently expect that the impact on net income on a full year basis will be significantly different from the historical pro forma impacts as previously disclosed in the stock option plans policy description in part ii  item in this report under note summary of signigicant accounting policies 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act became law in the united states 
the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare 
the benefit and subsidy introduced by the act begin in in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp requires an employer to initially account for any subsidy received under the act as an actuarial experience gain to the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo  which would be amortized over future service periods 
future subsidies would reduce service cost each year 
fsp was effective for us in the third fiscal quarter ended october  we believe that our postretirement benefit plan is not actuarially equivalent to medicare part d under the act and consequently will not receive significant subsidies under the act 
cautionary factors nash finch and its representatives may  from time to time  make written or oral forward looking statements relating to developments  results  conditions or other events that the company expects or anticipates will occur in the future 
these forward looking statements may involve a wide variety of topics  such as the company s future financial performance or condition  its strategies  market or economic conditions or the competitive environment 
any forward looking statements made are based on management s then current expectations and assumptions and  as a result  are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or conditions to differ materially from those predicted or projected 
the following cautionary factors are considered to be the more significant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted or projected by any forward looking statements  and are provided here as a readily available reference 
these factors are in addition to any other cautionary statements  written or oral  which may be made or referred to in connection with any forward looking statement  or contained elsewhere in this report 
competitive conditions the wholesale food distribution and food retailing businesses are intensely competitive  characterized by high inventory turnover  narrow profit margins and increasing consolidation 
our food retailing business  focused in the upper midwest  has historically competed with traditional grocery stores and is increasingly competing with alternative store formats such as supercenters  warehouse clubs  dollar stores and extreme value food stores 
our distribution business competes not only with local  regional and national food distributors  but also with vertically integrated national and regional chains that employ a variety of formats  including supercenters  supermarkets and warehouse clubs 
some of our competitors are substantially larger and may have greater financial resources and geographic scope  lower merchandise acquisition costs and lower operating expenses than we do  intensifying price competition at the wholesale and retail levels 
industry consolidation and the expansion of alternative store formats  which have gained and continue to gain market share at the expense of traditional grocery stores  tend to produce even stronger competition for our food retail business and for the independent retailer customers of our distribution business 
to the extent our independent customers are acquired by our competitors or are not successful in competing with other retail chains and non traditional competitors  sales by our distribution business will also be affected 
if we fail to effectively implement strategies to respond to these competitive pressures  our operating results could be adversely affected by price reductions  decreased sales or margins  or loss of market share 
need to improve retail operations primarily due to the competitive conditions discussed above  same store sales in the company s retail business decreased in from  after having decreased in from the prior year 
we brought new leadership into the retail business in late with a view toward improving our response to and performance under these difficult competitive conditions 
it is expected that this effort will require a variety of initiatives of varying scope and duration 
in connection with such an undertaking there are numerous risks and uncertainties  including our ability to successfully identify those initiatives that will be the most effective in improving the competitive position of our retail business  our ability to efficiently and timely implement these initiatives  and the response of competitors to these initiatives 
if we are unable to improve the overall competitive position of our retail stores  the revenue and operating performance of that segment may continue to decline  and we may be compelled to close or dispose of additional stores and may incur restructuring or other charges associated with such closure and disposition activities 
sensitivity to economic conditions the food distribution and retailing industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions  particularly those that influence consumer confidence  spending and buying habits 
economic downturns or uncertainty may not only adversely affect overall demand and intensify price competition  but also cause consumers to trade down by purchasing lower priced  and often lower margin  items and to purchase less in traditional supermarket channels 
these consumer responses  coupled with the impact of general economic factors such as prevailing interest rates  food price inflation or deflation  employment trends in our markets  and labor and energy costs  can also have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
increasing volatility in financial markets may cause these factors to change with a greater degree of frequency and magnitude 
risks and costs associated with expansion and acquisition efforts to grow our distribution businesses may include acquisitions 
acquisitions entail various risks such as identifying suitable candidates at acceptable rates of return  timely and effectively integrating the operations  systems and personnel of the acquired business  retaining the customer base of the acquired operations  expenses of any undisclosed or potential environmental or legal liabilities and diversion of management s time and attention from other business concerns 
successful integration of any new operations will depend on our ability to manage those operations  realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by strengthened product offerings and expanded geographic market coverage  maintenance of the customer base and  to some degree  eliminate redundant and excess costs 
a failure to effectively manage these risks could increase the costs or reduce the benefits to be derived from acquisitions and expansion  and therefore negatively impact our business and operations 
customer retention and obtaining new customers in the distribution business increasing the growth and profitability of our distribution business is particularly dependent upon our ability to retain existing customers and capture additional distribution customers through our existing network of distribution centers  enabling us to more effectively utilize the fixed assets in that business 
our ability to achieve these goals is dependent  in part  upon our ability to continue to provide industry leading customer service  offer competitive products at low prices  maintain high levels of productivity and efficiency  particularly in the process of integrating new customers into our distribution system  and offer marketing  merchandising and ancillary services that provide value to our independent and military commissary customers 
if we are unable to execute these tasks effectively  we may not be able to attract significant numbers of new customers and attrition among our existing customer base could increase  either or both of which could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 
customer credit risk in the ordinary course of business  we extend credit  including loans  to our food distribution customers  and provide financial assistance to some customers by guaranteeing their loan or lease obligations 
we also lease store sites for sublease to independent retailers 
generally  our loans and other financial accommodations are extended to small businesses that are unrated and may have limited access to conventional financing 
while we seek to obtain security interests and other credit support in connection with the financial accommodations we extend  such collateral may not be sufficient to cover our exposure 
in addition  as of january   one retailer comprised of our balance of outstanding loans 
greater than expected losses from existing or future credit extensions  loans  guarantee commitments or sublease arrangements  particularly in times of economic difficulty or uncertainty  could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results 
impact of debt and debt covenants on operating flexibility covenants in the documents governing our outstanding or future debt  or our future debt levels  could limit our operating and financial flexibility 
our ability to respond to market conditions and opportunities as well as capital needs could be constrained by the degree to which we are leveraged  by changes in the availability or cost of capital  and by contractual limitations on the degree to which we may  without the consent of our lenders  take actions such as engaging in mergers or acquisitions  incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures and making investments  loans or advances 
if needs or opportunities were identified that would require financial resources beyond existing resources  obtaining those resources could increase the company s borrowing costs  further reduce financial flexibility  require alterations in strategies and affect future operating results 
possible changes in military commissary system because our military food distribution segment sells and distributes grocery products to military commissaries in the us and overseas  any material changes in the commissary system  in military staffing levels or in locations of bases may have a corresponding impact on the sales and operating performance of this segment 
these changes could include privatization of some or all of the military commissary system  relocation or consolidation in the number of commissaries  base closings  troop redeployments or consolidations in the geographic areas containing commissaries served by us  or a reduction in the number of persons having access to the commissaries 
other factors other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted include changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations  issues affecting the food distribution and retail industry generally  such as food safety concerns  an increase in consumers eating away from home and the manner in which vendors target their promotional dollars  the ability to attract and retain qualified employees  unanticipated problems with product procurement  changes in vendor promotions or allowances  adverse determinations or developments with respect to litigation  other legal proceedings or the sec investigation of nash finch  the success or failure of new business ventures or initiatives  natural disasters and acts of terrorism 
the foregoing discussion of important factors is not exhaustive  and we do not undertake to revise any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date the statement is made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure in the financial markets consists of changes in interest rates relative to our investment in notes receivable  the balance of our debt obligations outstanding  and derivatives employed from time to time to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we carry notes receivable because  in the normal course of business  we make long term loans to certain retail customers 
substantially all notes receivable are based on floating interest rates which adjust to changes in market rates 
as a result  the carrying value of notes receivable approximates market value
