item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a multi state managed care organization that arranges for the delivery of health care services to persons eligible for medicaid and other programs for low income families and individuals 
our objective is to become the leading managed care organization in the united states focused primarily on serving people who receive health care benefits through state sponsored programs for low income populations 
we generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate 
premium revenue is fixed in advance of the periods covered and is not subject to significant accounting estimates 
for the year ended december  we received approximately of our premium revenue as a fixed amount per member per month  or pmpm  pursuant to our contracts with state medicaid agencies and other managed care organizations with which we operate as a subcontractor 
these premium revenues are recognized in the month members are entitled to receive health care services 
approximately of our premium revenue in the year ended december  was realized under a cost plus reimbursement agreement that our utah subsidiary has with that state 
we also received approximately of our premium revenue for the year ended december  in the form of birth payments one time payments for the delivery of children from the medicaid programs in washington  michigan and new mexico 
such payments are recognized as revenue in the month the birth occurs 
the state medicaid programs periodically adjust premium rates 
membership growth has been the primary reason for our increasing revenues 
we have increased our membership through both internal growth and acquisitions 
the following table sets forth the approximate number of members by state in the periods presented 
as of december  state california michigan utah washington new mexico total the following table details member months defined as the aggregation of each month s membership for the period by state for the years ended december    and state california michigan utah washington new mexico total 
table of contents other operating revenue primarily includes fee for service revenue generated by our clinics in california and savings sharing revenues in utah  california  and michigan  where we receive additional incentive payments from the states if inpatient medical costs are less than prescribed amounts 
the savings sharing provisions of our contract with the state of michigan are no longer in effect  and we recognized our last savings sharing revenue in that state in the second quarter of our operating expenses include expenses related to the provision of medical care services and salary  general and administrative  or sg a  costs 
our results of operations depend on our ability to effectively manage expenses related to health benefits and accurately predict costs incurred 
expenses related to medical care services include two components direct medical expenses and medically related administrative costs 
direct medical expenses include payments to physicians  hospitals  and providers of ancillary medical services  such as pharmacy  laboratory  and radiology services 
medically related administrative costs include expenses relating to health education  quality assurance  case management  disease management  hour on call nurses  member services  and compliance 
in general  primary care physicians are paid on a capitation basis a fixed amount per member per month regardless of actual utilization of medical services  while specialists and hospitals are paid on a fee for service basis 
for the year ended december   approximately of our direct medical expenses were related to fees paid to providers on a fee for service basis  with the balance paid on a capitation basis 
physician providers not paid on a capitated basis are paid on a fee schedule set by the state or by our contracts with these providers 
we pay hospitals in a variety of ways  including fee for service  per diems  diagnostic related groups  and case rates 
capitation payments are fixed in advance of periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates 
these payments are expensed in the period the providers are obligated to provide services 
fee for service payments are expensed in the period services are provided to our members 
medical care costs include actual historical claims experience and estimates of medical expenses incurred but not reported  or ibnr 
monthly  we estimate our ibnr based on a number of factors  including prior claims experience  inpatient hospital utilization data  and prior authorization of medical services 
as part of this review  we also consider estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties related to fluctuations in provider billing patterns  claims payment patterns  membership  and medical cost trends 
these estimates are adjusted monthly as more information becomes available 
we employ our own actuary 
we believe that our process for estimating ibnr is adequate  but there can be no assurance that medical care costs will not exceed such estimates 
sg a costs are largely comprised of wage and benefit costs related to our employee base and other administrative expenses 
some sg a services are provided locally  while others are delivered to our health plans from a centralized location 
the major centralized functions are claims processing  information systems  finance and accounting services  and legal and regulatory services 
locally provided functions include marketing to the extent permitted by law and regulation  plan administration  and provider relations 
included in sg a expenses are premium taxes for the washington hmo  the michigan hmo beginning in the second quarter of  and the new mexico hmo beginning with its acquisition on july  

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth selected operating ratios 
all ratios with the exception of the medical care ratio are shown as a percentage of total revenue 
the medical care ratio is shown as a percentage of premium and other operating revenue because there is a direct relationship between the premiums and other operating revenue earned and the cost of health care 
year ended december  premium revenue other operating revenue investment income total revenue medical care ratio salary  general and administrative expenses operating income net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  premium revenue premium revenue for was billion  up million from million for membership growth contributed million to the increase in revenue 
year end enrollment increased to  members at december   from  members at the same date of the prior year 
member months for the year ended december  increased by to  from  for the year ended december  year end enrollment increased by at our washington hmo and by at our michigan hmo between and the transfer of membership from other managed care companies was the primary source of enrollment growth in both states 
our new mexico acquisition effective july  added  members to our total year end enrollment the remaining million increase in premium revenue was attributable to increases in premium rates and proportionally greater increases in membership in those states with higher premium rates 
premium revenue on a per member per month basis is substantially higher at our new mexico hmo than at our other hmos 
other operating revenue other operating revenue increased to million for from million for other operating revenue for included million of savings sharing income recognized by our utah hmo 
our utah hmo recognized no savings sharing income prior to for  our michigan hmo recognized approximately million in savings sharing income 
our michigan hmo s contract with the state no longer contains risk sharing provisions 
other than the amounts recognized by our utah and michigan hmos for savings sharing  other operating revenue consisted primarily of revenue earned by our california medical clinic operations approximately million for both and and approximately million of income earned by our new mexico hmo during for performing certain administrative services for the state 
investment income investment income for increased to million from million for due to greater average invested balance and higher investment yields 

table of contents medical care costs medical care costs for were million  representing of premium and other operating revenue for all of  as compared with million  representing of premium and other operating revenue for all of the increase in the medical care ratio is due in large part to increases in enrollment in states and programs that experience higher medical care ratios than our company wide average 
increased aged  blind and disabled membership in our michigan hmo and the acquisition of our new mexico hmo  which has traditionally experienced a higher medical care ratio than our other hmos  were major contributors to the higher medical care ratio 
despite the increase in the medical care ratio noted in the preceding paragraph  all of our hmos remain profitable 
the new mexico hmo  with per member per month revenues over twice the average of the rest of our hmos  produces the highest medical margin defined as the difference between total medical care costs and total premium and other operating revenue per member per month among our hmos 
on a consolidated basis  medical margin per member per month increased to for from for salary  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses for were million as compared with million for the largest component of the increase in sg a was an increase in premium tax expense of million in sg a expenses as a percentage of total revenue were for as compared with for excluding premium taxes  sg a expenses decreased to of total revenue for from of total revenue for depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for increased to million from million for the increase was primarily due to increased capital spending for computer equipment and leasehold improvements and increased amortization of purchased member contracts 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million for from million for the due to decreased debt balances 
other income other income for includes a pretax gain of million recognized upon the termination of certain collateral assignment split dollar insurance agreements between our company and the molina siblings trust  a related party  during the first quarter of we had agreed to make premium payments towards the life insurance policies held by the trust on the life of mary r 
molina 
we were not an insured under the policies  but were entitled to receive repayment of all premium advances from the trust upon the earlier of mrs 
molina s death or cancellation of the policies 
receivables  representing premium payments made by us  were discounted based on mrs 
molina s remaining actuarial life 
on march   the collateral assignment split dollar insurance agreements were terminated by the early repayment of the advances to the trust 
the gain of million represents the recovery of the discounts previously recorded 
provision for income taxes income tax expense totaled million in  resulting in an effective tax rate of  as compared to million in  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
during both and  we pursued 
table of contents various strategies to reduce our federal  state  and local taxes 
as a result  we have reduced our state income tax expense due to california economic development tax credits credits 
our tax expense was reduced by approximately million and million for and  respectively  by out of year credits 
consulting fees incurred in connection with the credits  were recorded as salary  general and administrative expenses 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  premium revenue premium revenue for was million  up million  or from million for membership growth contributed million to the increase in revenue 
year over year enrollment increased to  members at december   from  members at the same date of the prior year 
membership growth was most pronounced at our michigan hmo  which saw year over year enrollment increase to  from  the michigan hmo added  and  members in the fourth and third quarters of  respectively  as a result of the acquisition of medicaid contracts from other health plans 
the remainder of the additional revenue  or million  was attributable to increases in premium rates and proportionally greater increases in membership in those states with higher premium rates 
other operating revenue other operating revenue decreased to million for from million for the decrease was the result of reduced savings sharing revenue at our california and michigan hmos 
investment income investment income for decreased to million from million for due to lower investment yields  which were partially offset by greater invested balances 
medical care costs medical care costs for were million  representing of premium and other operating revenue  as compared with million  representing of premium and other operating revenue  for the increase in the medical care ratio was due to increases in specialty  hospital  and pharmacy expense  partially offset by reduced capitation costs 
additionally  medical margins in were reduced by changes in the state of washington s method of compensating us for certain health care costs reimbursed by the supplemental security income program 
salary  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses for were million as compared with million after deducting million in stock option settlement expenses for the increase was primarily due to an increase in premium tax expense of million in sg a expenses as a percentage of total revenue were for as compared with adjusted for the stock option settlement expense for depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for increased to million from million for the increase was primarily due to increased capital spending for computer equipment and leasehold improvements 
interest expense interest expense increased to million for from 
million for interest expense increased due to the amortization of loan fee expense associated with our credit facility  as well as the payment of interest

interest expense was reduced by our repayment of a mortgage note in the second quarter of provision for income taxes income taxes totaled million in  resulting in an effective tax rate of  as compared to million in  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the lower tax rate was due to i our washington health plan  which does not pay state income taxes  generating a greater percentage of our total earnings  and ii our receiving million of california economic development tax credits credits in as compared to our receiving 
million in approximately million of the credits relate to prior years that are being recovered through amended state tax filings 
the table below includes a breakdown of the total credits  net of recovery fees paid to consultants included in salary  general and administrative expenses reduced income taxes recovery fees net income diluted earnings per share prior years total credits the prior year credit recognized in  net of recovery fees  of 
per diluted share was accounted for as a change in estimate 
acquisitions effective june   we completed our acquisition of the healthy options medicaid and basic health plan contracts of premera blue cross  adding approximately  members 
we paid to premera million for both contracts in addition to assuming an estimated million in medical related liabilities 
the transaction was funded with cash internally generated by our washington hmo 
on july   we closed on our acquisition of health care horizons  inc  or hch  the parent company of cimarron health plan  inc now molina healthcare of new mexico  inc  a new mexico corporation 
total consideration for the acquisition  including direct transaction costs was million 
at the close of the acquisition  we extinguished approximately million of outstanding hch bank debt 
we funded the acquisition with proceeds from our initial and secondary public offerings 
prior to the closing of the hch acquisition  we announced a definitive agreement had been reached to transfer the commercial membership acquired in the hch purchase to lovelace sandia health system  inc  or lovelace 
effective august   the transfer was completed 
we received a total of million net of approximately million in direct transactions costs in connection with the transfer 
we also entered into a transition services agreement with lovelace to provide commercial claims processing  customer and provider call handling  and billing and treasury services through the date the commercial contracts are expected to be fully transitioned to lovelace 
on october   we transitioned approximately  members from the wellness plan of michigan into our michigan hmo 
total consideration paid in connection with the transition of these members was approximately million including direct acquisition costs 
on november   our california hmo and sharp health plan  or sharp  entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement to transfer sharp s medi cal medicaid and healthy families program schip 
table of contents contracts to our california hmo 
as of march   the proposed transfer had been approved by each of the california department of managed health care and the california managed risk medical insurance board for a transfer effective as of june  the transaction would add approximately  members to our california hmo s current membership 
we anticipate paying approximately million for the transfer of these contracts  subject to possible adjustment and an earn out provision 
as part of the transaction  sharp will assign the bulk of its provider network to our california hmo 
on december   our california hmo  and universal care  inc  a california corporation  entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement to transfer universal s medi cal and healthy families contracts to our california hmo 
as of march   the proposed transfer had been approved by each of the california department of managed health care and the california managed risk medical insurance board for a transfer effective as of june  the transaction would add approximately  members to our california hmo s current membership 
we anticipate paying approximately million for the transfer of these contracts  subject to possible adjustment 
as part of the transaction  universal will assign the bulk of its provider network related to its medi cal and healthy families members to our california hmo 
liquidity and capital resources we generate cash from premium revenue  services provided on a fee for service basis at our clinics  and investment income 
our primary uses of cash include the payment of expenses related to medical care services  sg a expenses and acquisitions 
we generally receive premium revenue in advance of payment of claims for related health care services  with the exception of our utah hmo 
in july  we completed the initial public offering of our common stock 
we sold  shares  generating net proceeds of approximately million after deducting approximately million in fees and expenses and million in the underwriters discount 
in march  we completed a public offering of our common stock 
we sold  shares  generating net proceeds of approximately million after deducting approximately million in fees and expenses and million in the underwriters discount 
our offerings of common stock in july and march  respectively  have substantially enhanced our liquidity 
additionally  because we generally receive premium revenue in advance of payment for the related medical care costs with the exception of our utah hmo  our cash has increased during periods when we experienced enrollment growth 
our ability to support the increase in membership with existing infrastructure also allows us to retain a larger portion of the additional premium revenue as profit 
at december   we had working capital of million as compared to million at december  at december  and december   cash and cash equivalents were million and million  respectively 
at december  and december   our investments were million and million  respectively 
our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital prescribed by the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
as of december   all of our subsidiaries were in compliance with the minimum capital requirements 
barring any change in regulatory requirements  we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements at least through we also believe that our cash resources and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our operations  regulatory requirements  and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest their funds 
our restricted investments are invested principally in certificates of deposit and treasury securities with maturities of up to months 

table of contents our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity  preserve capital  and maximize total return on invested assets  all in a manner consistent with state requirements 
as of december   we invested a substantial portion of our cash in a portfolio of highly liquid money market securities 
as of december   our investments consisted solely of investment grade debt securities all of which are classified as current assets with a maximum maturity of five years and an average duration of two years 
two professional portfolio managers operating under documented investment guidelines manage our investments 
the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest their funds 
our restricted investments are invested principally in certificates of deposit and treasury securities with maturities of up to months 
the average annualized portfolio yield for the years ended december    and was approximately   and  respectively 
net cash provided by operations was million for and million for the increase in net cash provided by operations for when compared to was due to the following factors increased net income million higher in  increased depreciation and amortization expense million higher in  increased medical claims and benefits payable a source of million in compared to a source of million in  changes in accounts receivable balances  which were a use of million in compared to a use of million in  changes in miscellaneous working capital accounts a source of million in compared to a source of million in 
credit facility we entered into a credit agreement dated as of march   under which a syndicate of lenders provided a million senior secured credit facility 
interest on any amount outstanding under the facility is payable monthly at a rate per annum of a libor plus a margin ranging from to basis points or b the higher of i bank of america prime or ii the federal funds rate plus  plus a margin ranging from to basis points 
all borrowings under the credit facility are due and payable in full by march  the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our parent company s real and personal property and the real and personal property of one of our utah subsidiaries and  subject to certain limitations  all shares of our washington hmo subsidiary  our michigan hmo subsidiary  our new mexico hmo subsidiary  and our utah hmo subsidiary 
the terms of the credit agreement contain various covenants that place restrictions on our and or our subsidiaries ability to incur debt  pay dividends  create liens  make investments  optionally repay  redeem or repurchase our securities  and enter into mergers  dispositions  and transactions with affiliates 
the credit agreement also requires us to meet various financial covenants  including a minimum fixed charge coverage requirement  a maximum consolidated leverage ratio  a minimum consolidated net worth requirement  a capital expenditure limit  and individual subsidiary risk based capital levels 
at december   we were in compliance with all of these covenants 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 
we are currently in the process of amending and restating our credit facility to increase the maximum amount that can be borrowed under the facility to million  and to make certain other revisions 
we anticipate that this amendment and restatement will be completed in the first half of march 
table of contents regulatory capital and dividend restrictions at december   our principal operations are conducted through the five hmos operating in california  washington  michigan  utah  and new mexico 
the hmos are subject to state laws that  among other things  may require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment  and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their sole stockholder 
to the extent the subsidiaries must comply with these regulations  they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us 
the net assets in these subsidiaries after intercompany eliminations  which may not be transferable to us in the form of loans  advances  or cash dividends was million at december   and million at december  the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules effective december   which  if implemented by the states  set new minimum capitalization requirements for insurance companies  hmos  and other entities bearing risk for health care coverage 
the requirements take the form of risk based capital rules 
these hmo rules  which may vary from state to state  have been adopted in washington  michigan  utah  and new mexico 
california has not adopted risk based capital requirements for hmos and has not formally given notice of its intention to do so 
the national association of insurance commissioners hmo rules  if adopted by california  may increase the minimum capital required for that state 
as of december   our hmos had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million  compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million 
all of our hmos were in compliance with the minimum capital requirements 
critical accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures 
the determination of our liability for claims and medical benefits payable is particularly important to the determination of our financial position and results of operations and requires the application of significant judgment by our management and  as a result  is subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our medical care costs include actual historical claims experience and estimates for medical care costs incurred but not reported to us ibnr 
we  together with our independent actuaries  estimate medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods based upon historical data adjusted for payment patterns  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  utilization of health care services  and other relevant factors 
the estimation methods and the resulting reserves are frequently reviewed and updated  and adjustments  if necessary  are reflected in the period known 
we also record reserves for estimated referral claims related to medical groups under contract with us that are financially troubled or insolvent and that may not be able to honor their obligations for the payment of medical services provided by other providers 
in these instances  we may be required to honor these obligations for legal or business reasons 
based on our current assessment of providers under contract with us  such losses are not expected to be significant 
in applying this policy  we use judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions for determining the required estimates 
while we believe our estimates are adequate  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates 
in assessing the adequacy of accruals for medical claims liabilities  we consider our historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  our knowledge of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other sources  as appropriate 
the most significant estimates involved in determining our claims liability concern the determination of claims payment completion factors and trended per member per month cost estimates 
for the five months of service prior to the reporting date and earlier  we estimate our outstanding claims liability based upon actual claims paid  adjusted for estimated completion factors 
completion factors seek to 
table of contents measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will have been paid for a given month of service as of a date subsequent to that month of service 
completion factors are based upon historical payment patterns 
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december  that would have resulted had we changed our completion factors for the fifth through the twelfth months preceding that date by the percentages indicated 
our utah hmo is excluded from these calculations  as the majority of the utah business is conducted under a cost reimbursement contract 
amounts are in thousands 
increase decrease in estimated completion factors increase decrease in medical claims and benefits payable for the four months of service immediately prior to the reporting date  actual claims paid are not a reliable measure of our ultimate liability  given the delay inherent between the patient physician encounter and the actual submission of a claim for payment 
for these months of service we estimate our claims liability based upon trended per member per month cost estimates 
these estimates reflect recent trends in payments and expense  utilization patterns  authorized services  and other relevant factors 
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december  that would have resulted had we altered our trend factors by the percentages indicated 
our utah hmo is excluded from these calculations  as the majority of the utah business is conducted under a cost reimbursement contract 
amounts are in thousands 
increase decrease in trended per member per month cost estimates increase decrease in medical claims and benefits payable assuming a hypothetical change in both completion factors and per member per month cost estimates from those used in our calculation of ibnr at december   net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million  or 
per diluted share  net of tax 
commitments and contingencies we lease office space and equipment under various operating leases 
as of december   our lease obligations for the next five years and thereafter are as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and an aggregate of million thereafter 
we lease certain equipment at our new mexico hmo under capital leases 
as of december   our lease obligations for the next five years and thereafter are as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  and none thereafter 
we are not an obligor to or guarantor of any indebtedness of any other party 
we are not a party to off balance sheet financing arrangements except for operating leases which are disclosed in the commitments and 
table of contents contingencies section of our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report and the notes thereto 
we have in the past made certain advances and loans to related parties  which are discussed in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report and the notes thereto 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our contractual obligations as of december  some of the figures we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table 
amounts are in thousands 
and beyond operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase commitments mortgage note obligation total contractual obligations 
table of contents risk factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report  the following are some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties  including those not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial  also may result in decreased revenues  increased expenses  or other events which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
risks related to our business reductions in medicaid funding could substantially reduce our profitability 
substantially all of our revenues come from state medicaid premiums 
the premium rates paid by each state to health plans like ours differ depending on a combination of factors  such as upper payment limits established by the federal and state governments  a member s health status  age  gender  county or region  benefit mix  and member eligibility categories 
future medicaid premium rate levels may be affected by continued government efforts to contain medical costs  or federal and state budgetary constraints 
changes in medicaid funding could  for example  reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for medicaid  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels by the federal or state governments or increase our administrative or health benefit costs 
additionally  changes could eliminate coverage for certain benefits such as our pharmacy  behavioral health  vision  or other benefits 
in some cases  changes in funding could be made retroactive 
the federal government and all of the states in which we operate are presently considering proposals and legislation that would implement certain medicaid reforms or redesigns  reduce reimbursement or payment levels  or reduce the number of persons eligible for medicaid 
reductions in medicaid payments at either the federal or state level could reduce our profitability if we are unable to reduce our expenses 
if our government contracts or our subcontracts with government contractors are not renewed or are terminated  our business will suffer 
all of our contracts are terminable for cause if we breach a material provision of the contract or violate relevant laws or regulations 
our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state in the event of unavailability of state or federal funding 
in some jurisdictions  such cancellation may be immediate and in other jurisdictions a notice period is required 
in addition  most contracts are terminable without cause 
most contracts are for a specified period and are subject to non renewal 
our other contracts are also eligible for termination or renewal through annual competitive bids 
we may face increased competition as other plans attempt to enter our markets through the contracting process 
if we are unable to renew  successfully rebid  or compete for any of our government contracts  or if any of our contracts are terminated  our business will suffer 
if we are unable to effectively manage medical costs  our profitability could be reduced 
our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on our ability to predict and effectively manage medical costs 
historically  our medical care costs as a percentage of premium and other operating revenue have fluctuated 
relatively small changes in these medical care ratios can create significant changes in our financial results 
changes in health care laws  regulations and practices  level of use of health care services  hospital costs  pharmaceutical costs  major epidemics  terrorism or bioterrorism  new medical technologies  and other external factors  including general economic conditions such as inflation levels  could reduce our ability to predict and effectively control the costs of providing health care services 
although we have been able to manage medical care costs through a variety of techniques  including various payment methods to primary care physicians and other providers  advance approval for hospital services and referral requirements  medical management and quality management programs  our information systems  and reinsurance arrangements  we may not be able to continue to effectively manage medical care costs in the future 
if our medical care costs increase  our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable 

table of contents a failure to accurately estimate incurred but not reported medical care costs may hamper our operations 
our medical care costs include estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we  together with our independent actuaries  estimate our medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods based on historical data adjusted for payment patterns  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  utilization of health care services and other relevant factors 
the estimation methods and the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated  and adjustments  if necessary  are reflected in the period known 
while our estimates of claims incurred but not reported have been adequate in the past  they may be inadequate in the future  which would negatively affect our results of operations 
further  our inability to accurately estimate claims incurred but not reported may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions  further exacerbating the extent of the negative impact on our results 
if we estimate claims incurred but not reported too conservatively  our profits may be understated  which could result in inaccurate disclosure to the public in our periodic reports 
we are subject to extensive government regulation 
any changes to the laws and regulations governing our business  or the interpretation and enforcement of those laws or regulations  could cause us to modify our operations and could negatively impact our operating results 
our business is extensively regulated by the federal government and the states in which we operate 
the laws and regulations governing our operations are generally intended to benefit and protect health plan members and providers rather than stockholders 
the government agencies administering these laws and regulations have broad latitude to enforce them 
these laws and regulations along with the terms of our government contracts regulate how we do business  what services we offer  and how we interact with members and the public 
these laws and regulations  and their interpretations  are subject to frequent change 
changes in existing laws or regulations  or their interpretations  or the enactment of new laws or regulations could reduce our profitability by imposing additional capital requirements  increasing our liability  increasing our administrative and other costs  increasing or decreasing mandated benefits  forcing us to restructure our relationships with providers  or requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems 
for example  congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act of which mandates that health plans enhance privacy protections for member protected health information 
this requires health plans to add  at significant cost  new administrative  information  and security systems to prevent inappropriate release of protected member health information 
the requirements for compliance with this law are uncertain and will continue to affect our profitability 
the regulations enacting this law also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for non compliance  including fines for violations of the regulations by our business associates 
individual states periodically consider adding operational requirements applicable to health plans  often without identifying funding for these requirements 
california recently required all health plans to make available to members independent medical review of their claims 
this requirement is costly to implement and could affect our profitability 
we are subject to various routine and non routine governmental reviews  audits  and investigation 
violation of the laws governing our operations  or changes in interpretations of those laws  could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties  the cancellation of our contracts to provide managed care services  the suspension or revocation of our licenses  and exclusion from participation in government sponsored health programs  including medicaid and schip 
if we become subject to material fines or if other sanctions or other corrective actions were imposed upon us  we might suffer a substantial reduction in profitability  and might also lose one or more of our government contracts and as a result lose significant numbers of members and amounts of revenue 

table of contents our business depends on our information systems  and our inability to effectively integrate  manage  and keep secure our information systems could disrupt our operations 
our business is dependent on effective and secure information systems that assist us in  among other things  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  supporting our health care management techniques  processing provider claims  and providing data to our regulators 
our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications  claims status  and other information 
if we experience a reduction in the performance  reliability  or availability of our information systems  our operations and ability to produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected 
in addition  our information system software is leased from a third party 
if the owner of the software were to become insolvent and fail to support the software  our operations could be negatively affected 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading  and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
moreover  our acquisition activity requires transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information systems 
we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities 
if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly implement  maintain  or expand our system  we could suffer from  among other things  operational disruptions  loss of members  difficulty in attracting new members  regulatory problems  and increases in administrative expenses 
our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems and client data stored in our information systems 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our confidential information or cause interruptions in services or operations 
the internet is a public network  and data is sent over this network from many sources 
in the past  computer viruses or software programs that disable or impair computers have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet 
computer viruses theoretically could be introduced into our systems  or those of our providers or regulators  which could disrupt our operations  or make our systems inaccessible to our providers or regulators 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
because of the confidential health information we store and transmit  security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action  litigation  possible liability and loss 
our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches  and our business operations would be negatively impacted by cancellation of contracts and loss of members if they are not prevented 
difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business 
the acquisitions of medicaid contract rights and other health plans have accounted for a significant amount of our growth 
although we cannot predict with certainty our rate of growth as the result of acquisitions  we believe that acquisitions similar in nature to those we have historically executed will be important to our future growth strategy 
many of the other potential purchasers of these assets have greater financial resources than we have 
also  many of the sellers may insist on selling assets that we do not want  such as commercial lines of business  or may insist on transferring their liabilities to us as part of the sale of their companies or assets 
even if we identify suitable targets  we may be unable to complete acquisitions on terms favorable to us or obtain the necessary financing for these acquisitions 
further  to the extent we complete an acquisition  we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisition because of operational factors or difficulty in integrating the acquisition with the existing business 
this may include the integration of additional employees who are not familiar with our operations  new provider networks  which may operate on terms different from our existing networks  additional members  who may decide to transfer to other health care providers or health plans  
table of contents disparate information  claims processing  and record keeping systems  and accounting policies  including those which require judgmental and complex estimation processes  such as estimates of claims incurred but not reported  accounting for goodwill  intangible assets  stock based compensation  and income tax matters 
also  we are generally required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions 
for example  the previously announced agreements to transfer to the company the medi cal medicaid and healthy families program california s schip contracts of both sharp health plan and universal care in san diego county require four separate governmental agency approvals 
in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not already operate  we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state 
in addition  although we may already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business  we will be required to obtain regulatory approval if  as a result of the acquisition  we will operate in an area of the state in which we did not operate previously 
we may be unable to obtain the necessary governmental approvals or to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner  or at all 
for all of the above reasons  we may not be able to consummate our proposed acquisitions as announced or to sustain our pattern of growth 
ineffective management of our growth may negatively affect our results of operations  financial condition  and business 
depending on acquisition and other opportunities  we expect to continue to grow our membership and to expand into other markets 
in  we had total revenue of million 
in  we had total revenue of billion 
continued rapid growth could place a significant strain on our management and on other resources 
our ability to manage our growth may depend on our ability to strengthen our management team and attract  train  and retain skilled employees  and our ability to implement and improve operational  financial  and management information systems on a timely basis 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  due to the initial substantial costs related to acquisitions  rapid growth could adversely affect our short term profitability and liquidity 
we are subject to competition which negatively impacts our ability to increase penetration in the markets we serve 
we operate in a highly competitive environment and in an industry that is currently subject to significant changes from business consolidations  new strategic alliances  and aggressive marketing practices by other managed care organizations 
we compete for members principally on the basis of size  location  and quality of provider network  benefits supplied  quality of service  and reputation 
a number of these competitive elements are partially dependent upon and can be positively affected by financial resources available to a health plan 
many other organizations with which we compete have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
for these reasons  we may be unable to grow our membership 
restrictions and covenants in our credit facility may limit our ability to make certain acquisitions and declare dividends 
we have a credit facility that imposes various restrictions and covenants  including prescribed debt coverage ratios  net worth requirements  and acquisition limitations  that restrict our financial and operating flexibility  including our ability to make certain acquisitions above specified values and declare dividends without lender approval 
our growth strategy may be negatively impacted by our inability to act with complete flexibility 
we are dependent on our executive officers and other key employees 
our operations are highly dependent on the efforts of our president and chief executive officer and our executive vice presidents  some of whom have entered into employment agreements with us 
these employment 
table of contents agreements may not provide sufficient incentives for those employees to continue their employment with us 
while we believe that we could find replacements  the loss of their leadership  knowledge  and experience could negatively impact our operations 
replacing many of our executive officers might be difficult or take an extended period of time because a limited number of individuals in the managed care industry have the breadth and depth of skills and experience necessary to operate and expand successfully a business such as ours 
our success is also dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified management  technical  and medical personnel 
we may be unsuccessful in recruiting and retaining such personnel which could negatively impact our operations 
claims relating to medical malpractice and other litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses 
our providers involved in medical care decisions may be exposed to the risk of medical malpractice claims 
providers at the primary care clinics we operate in california are employees of our california subsidiary 
as a direct employer of physicians and ancillary medical personnel and as an operator of primary care clinics  our subsidiary may experience increased exposure to liability for acts or omissions by our employees and for acts or injuries occurring on our premises 
we maintain errors and omissions insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and in aggregate for each policy year  medical malpractice insurance for our clinics in the amount of million per occurrence  and an annual aggregate limit of million  and such other lines of coverage as we believe are reasonable in light of our experience to date 
however  this insurance may not be sufficient or available at a reasonable cost to protect us from damage awards or other liabilities 
even if any claims brought against us were unsuccessful or without merit  we would have to defend ourselves against such claims 
the defense of any such actions may be time consuming and costly  and may distract our management s attention 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to effectively operate our business 
in addition  claimants often sue managed care organizations for improper denials or delay of care 
also  congress  as well as several states  are considering legislation that would permit managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations 
if this or similar legislation were enacted  claims of this nature could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable medical malpractice insurance coverage 
successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us  our providers  or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability 
the results of our operations could be negatively impacted by both upturns and downturns in general economic conditions 
the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has historically increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment  corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions 
however  during such economic downturns  state and federal budgets could decrease  causing states to attempt to cut health care programs  benefits  and rates 
if federal or state funding were decreased while our membership was increasing  our results of operations would be negatively affected 
conversely  the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve 
therefore  improvements in general economic conditions may cause our membership levels and profitability to decrease  which could lead to decreases in our operating income and stock price 
if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our affiliates to us  it may negatively affect our business strategy 
we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that they can pay to us without prior approval of  or notification to  state regulators 
in california  our health plan may dividend  without notice to or approval of the california department of managed health care  amounts by which its tangible net equity exceeds of the tangible net equity requirement 
in michigan  utah  washington  and new mexico  our health plans must give thirty days advance notice and the opportunity to disapprove extraordinary dividends to the respective 
table of contents state departments of insurance for amounts over the lesser of a ten percent of surplus or net worth at the prior year end or b the net income for the prior year 
the discretion of the state regulators  if any  in approving or disapproving a dividend is not clearly defined 
health plans that declare non extraordinary dividends must usually provide notice to the regulators ten or fifteen days in advance of the intended distribution date of the non extraordinary dividend 
the aggregate amounts our health plan subsidiaries could have paid us at december    and without approval of the regulatory authorities were approximately million  million  and million  respectively  assuming no dividends had been paid during the respective calendar years 
if the regulators were to deny or significantly restrict our subsidiaries requests to pay dividends to us  the funds available to our company as a whole would be limited  which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 
for example  we could be hindered in our ability to make debt service payments on amounts drawn from our credit facility 
unforeseen changes in regulations or pharmaceutical market conditions may impact our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations 
a significant category of our health care costs relate to pharmaceutical products and services 
evolving regulations and state and federal mandates regarding coverage may impact the ability of our hmos to continue to receive existing price discounts on pharmaceutical products for our members 
other factors affecting our pharmaceutical costs include  but are not limited to  the price of pharmaceuticals  geographic variation in utilization of new and existing pharmaceuticals  and changes in discounts 
the unpredictable nature of these factors may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with our common stock our common stock has been publicly traded only since july  and the price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially 
our common stock has been traded on a public market for approximately eighteen months 
since our initial public offering in july  the closing sales price of our common stock has ranged from a low of to a high of 
a number of factors will continue to influence the market price of our common stock  including state and federal budget decreases  adverse publicity regarding health maintenance organizations and other managed care organizations  government action regarding eligibility  changes in government payment levels  changes in state mandatory programs  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates  if any  of public market analysts  announcements relating to our business or the business of our competitors  conditions generally affecting the managed care industry or our provider networks  the success of our operating or acquisition strategy  the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies  the termination of our medicaid or schip contracts with state or county agencies  or subcontracts with other medicaid managed care organizations that contract with such state or county agencies  regulatory or legislative change  and general economic conditions  including inflation and unemployment rates 

table of contents in addition  the stock market in general has been highly volatile recently 
during this period of market volatility  the stocks of health care companies also have been highly volatile and have recorded lows well below their historical highs 
our stock may not trade at the same levels as the stock of other health care companies and the market in general may not sustain its current prices 
also  if the trading market for our stock does not continue to develop  securities analysts may not initiate or maintain research coverage of our company and our shares  and this could further depress the market for our shares 
our stockholders will experience dilution with the future exercise of stock options 
as of december   we had outstanding options to purchase  shares of our common stock  of which  were exercisable 
from time to time  we may issue additional options to employees and non employee directors pursuant to our equity incentive plans 
these options generally vest commencing one year from the date of grant and continue vesting over a three year period 
once these options vest  our stockholders will experience further dilution as these stock options are exercised by their holders 
future sales  or the availability for sale  of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could materially impair our future ability to raise capital through offerings of our common stock 
our directors and officers and members of the molina family own a majority of our capital stock  decreasing the influence of other stockholders on stockholder decisions 
our executive officers and directors  in the aggregate  beneficially own approximately of our capital stock 
members of the molina family some of whom are also officers or directors  in the aggregate  beneficially own approximately of our capital stock  either directly or in trusts of which members of the molina family are beneficiaries 
in some cases  members of the molina family are trustees of the trusts 
as a result  molina family members  acting themselves or together with our officers and directors  will have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to stockholders for approval  including the election and removal of directors  amendments to our charter  and any merger  consolidation  or sale of substantially all of our assets 
a significant concentration of share ownership can also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often discount the value of stock in companies that have controlling stockholders 
furthermore  the concentration of ownership in our company could delay  defer  or prevent a merger or consolidation  takeover  or other business combination that could be favorable to our stockholders 
finally  the interests and objectives of our controlling stockholders may be different from those of our company or our other stockholders  and our controlling stockholders may vote their common stock in a manner that may adversely affect our other stockholders 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire our company  which could inhibit stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock price 
we are subject to the delaware anti takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers 
these provisions may prohibit stockholders owning or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws also contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial 
these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions include a staggered board of directors  so that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all directors  
table of contents prohibition of stockholder action by written consent  and advance notice requirements for the submission by stockholders of nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting 
in addition  changes of control are often subject to state regulatory notification  and in some cases  prior approval 
our forecasts and other forward looking statements are based on a variety of assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties 
our performance may not be consistent with these forecasts and forward looking statements 
from time to time in press releases and otherwise  we may publish forecasts or other forward looking statements regarding our future results  including estimated revenues  net earnings  and other operating and financial metrics 
any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions 
these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties  and as a matter of course  any number of them may prove to be incorrect 
further  the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors  including those described in this annual report on form k  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  we cannot assure that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse 
you are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions  but instead are encouraged to utilize the entire publicly available mix of historical and forward looking information  as well as other available information affecting us and our services  when evaluating our prospective results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  investments  receivables  and restricted investments 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  and restricted investments 
we invest a substantial portion of our cash in the cadre affinity fund and cadre reserve fund cadre funds  a portfolio of highly liquid money market securities 
professional portfolio managers operating under documented investment guidelines manage our investments 
restricted investments are invested principally in certificates of deposit 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to payors consisting principally of the governments of each state in which our hmo subsidiaries operate 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  investments of million  and restricted investments of million 
the cash equivalents consist of highly liquid securities with original maturities of up to three months that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash 
our investments all of which are classified as current assets consist solely of investment grade debt securities with a maximum maturity of five years and an average duration of two years 
the restricted investments consist of interest bearing deposits required by the respective states in which we operate 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
all non restricted investments are maintained at fair market value on the balance sheet 
we have the ability to hold these investments until maturity  and as a result  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 
inflation we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of health care services 
through these contracted providers  our health plans emphasize preventive health care and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate health care cost inflation will continue to be successful  competitive pressures  new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from health care providers and customers  applicable regulations  or other factors may affect our ability to control health care costs 
compliance costs our health plans are regulated by both state and federal government agencies 
regulation of managed care products and health care services is an evolving area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
changes in applicable laws and rules occur frequently 
compliance with such laws and rules may lead to additional costs related to the implementation of additional systems  procedures and programs that we have not yet identified
