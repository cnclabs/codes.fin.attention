item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes and tables included throughout this report 
all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report  including statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are  or may be deemed to be  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the exchange act 
as discussed below  the financial statements  footnotes  schedules and discussion within this report have been reformatted to conform to the presentation required for discontinued operations pursuant to the company s sale of its mortgage banking subsidiary 
executive overview first community bancshares is a full service commercial bank which has positioned itself as a community bank and a financial services alternative to larger regional banks which often provide less emphasis on personal relationships  and smaller community banks which lack the capital and resources to efficiently serve customer needs 
the company has focused its growth efforts on building financial partnerships and more enduring and complete relationships with businesses and individuals through a very personal approach to banking and financial services 
the company also seeks to expand its resources  capabilities and geographic reach through acquisitions of like minded community banking organizations and financial service providers 
the company and its operations are guided by a strategic plan which comprehends growth through acquisitions and through office expansion in new market areas including strategically identified metro markets in virginia  west virginia  north carolina and tennessee 
while the company s mission remains that of a community bank  management believes that entry into new markets will accelerate the company s growth rate by diversifying the demographics of its customer base and customer prospects and by generally increasing its sales and service network 
as part of the strategic plan  the company has set long term goals for growth and profitability 
during the early phases of the strategic plan the company has achieved some significant successes and  like most growth oriented companies  encountered challenges to achievement of these objectives 
these challenges include  but are not limited to i strong competition from bank and non bank competitors  ii aggressive pricing in the commercial and commercial real estate loan arena  and iii slower internal deposit growth in certain banking markets which has been exacerbated by the historically low interest rate environment experienced over the past year 
despite these challenges  the company has succeeded in establishing new offices in seven new market areas including six new loan production offices in the last year and three new full service offices since the second quarter of the company has also completed two bank acquisitions and one wealth management acquisition since january and has grown total resources by almost over the last two years and over over the last four years 
along with these successes the company has also experienced slower than planned internal deposit growth in legacy markets  and in august of  exited the once lucrative mortgage banking segment 
as a result of these events and in conjunction with its ongoing strategic planning process  the company  in its third quarter report  downwardly revised its internal targets for planned growth  to a level that it believes more appropriately reflects prospects for continued expansion  internal growth and profitability 
the company continues its pursuit of community banking partners and is progressing with plans for new offices within its established target markets 
additional details regarding acquisitions and expansion are included under the heading recent acquisitions and branching activity 
economy throughout the first half of certain interest rates remained at forty year lows 
this rate environment led to further compression of net interest margins until the third quarter of when increases in the federal funds target rate and the new york prime rate began to positively impact the loan portfolio 
lower interest rates  both commercial and residential  also helped to sustain loan demand and contribute to growth of the loan portfolio 

table of contents overall growth was moderated by a national economy which has begun a modest sustained recovery with moderate job growth on a national level 
the economy in general has also been supportive of favorable trends in asset quality nationwide 
the company likewise has benefited from those economic factors  including interest rates and growth in gnp  which have a buoying effect on delinquencies  non accruals  foreclosures and charge offs 
the local economies in which the company operates are diverse and cover the majority portion of a four state region 
west virginia and southwest virginia has and should continue to benefit from the uncertainty of oil prices and spikes in oil prices in these economies have significant exposure to extractive industries  coal and natural gas  which become more active and lucrative when oil prices surge 
in recent months we have seen more activity in development and start up in both coal and natural gas 
the local economies in the central portion of north carolina have suffered in recent years due to foreign competition in both furniture and textiles as well as consolidation in the financial services industry 
despite these detractions  the economies in this region continue to benefit from strong real estate development  good commercial occupancy rates and some recent announcements by national companies with relocation plans in the triad and central piedmont areas 
the eastern virginia local economies  principally greater richmond and fredericksburg  are experiencing strong growth in residential and commercial development as those areas continue to benefit from corporate activities and relocations and beltway sprawl  in the case of stafford and spotsylvania counties 
mortgage industry the mortgage industry outlook at the close of was on the decline on the expectation of rising interest rates 
this was one factor leading to the company s decision to exit that business 
throughout the first half of  rate increases had not materialized but the mortgage industry continued in malaise over the uncertainty of the economy and mortgage interest rates 
although the federal reserve eventually began increasing key overnight rates at midyear  mortgage interest rates and the treasury yield curve did not respond in the same fashion  possibly due to continued concerns over a start and stop recovery and slower than expected jobs growth 
as a result  mortgage interest rates remained relatively low throughout the year and mortgage origination volumes  while down  did not contract to the degree anticipated 
competitive focus as the company competes for increased market share and growth in both loans and deposits it continues to encounter strong competition from many sources 
bank expansion through de novo branches and loan production offices lpo s has grown in popularity as a means of reaching out to new markets 
many of the markets targeted by the company are also being entered by other banks in nearby markets and  in some cases  from more distant markets 
despite strong competition from other banks  credit unions and mortgage companies  the company has seen success in newly established offices in its winston salem de novo markets as well as new lpo s in virginia and other markets in both virginia and north carolina 
the company attributes this measure of success to its recruitment of local  established bankers and loan personnel in those targeted markets 
competitive forces do impact the company through pressure on interest yields  product fees and loan structure and terms  however  the company has countered these pressures with its relationship style and pricing and a disciplined approach to loan underwriting 
application of critical accounting policies first community s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
first community s financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies  including judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in first community s consolidated financial position and or consolidated results of operations 

table of contents estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary principally when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at estimated fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded based upon the probability of occurrence of a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal and external modeling techniques and or appraisal estimates 
first community s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a summary of first community s more subjective and complex critical accounting policies 
in addition  the disclosures presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in management s discussion and analysis  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the use of derivatives for hedging purposes accounting for income taxes and accounting for business acquisitions to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments 
derivatives hedging practices were eliminated in august with the disposition of ufm 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained at levels management deems adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is based on management s evaluation of the risks in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activity 
estimates for loan losses are determined by analyzing historical loan losses  current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  plans for problem loan resolution  the opinions of fcbi s regulators  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio and industry information 
also included in management s estimates for loan losses are considerations with respect to the impact of economic events  the outcome of which are uncertain 
these events may include  but are not limited to  a general slowdown in the economy  fluctuations in overall lending rates  political conditions  legislation that may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry and economic conditions affecting specific geographic areas in which first community conducts business 
as more fully described in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the discussion included in the allowance for loan losses section of this discussion  the company determines the allowance for loan losses by making specific allocations to impaired loans  loans that exhibit inherent weaknesses and loan pools that possess common credit risk factors 
allocations to loan pools are developed giving weight to risk ratings  historical loss trends and management s judgment concerning those trends and other relevant factors 
these factors may include  among others  actual versus estimated losses  regional and national economic conditions  business segment and portfolio concentrations  industry competition and consolidation  and the impact of government regulations 
the foregoing analysis is performed by the company s credit administration department to evaluate the portfolio and calculate an estimated valuation allowance through a quantitative and qualitative analysis that applies risk factors to those identified risk areas 
this risk management evaluation is applied at both the portfolio level and the individual loan level for commercial loans and credit relationships while the level of consumer and residential mortgage loan allowance is determined primarily on a total portfolio level based on a review of historical loss percentages and other qualitative factors including concentrations  industry specific factors and economic conditions 
the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios require more specific analysis of individually significant loans and the borrower s underlying cash flow  business conditions  capacity for debt repayment and the valuation of secondary sources of payment collateral 
this analysis may result in specifically identified weaknesses and corresponding specific impairment allowances 
the use of various estimates and judgments in the company s ongoing evaluation of the required level of allowance can significantly impact the company s results of operations and financial condition and may result 
table of contents in either greater provisions against earnings reducing net income and earnings per share to increase the allowance or reduced provisions increasing net income and earnings per share 
these estimates and judgments are based upon management s current view of portfolio and economic conditions and the application of revised estimates and assumptions 
loans held for sale and derivative financial instruments ufm previously provided a distribution outlet for the sale of loans 
it originated residential mortgage loans through its production offices and sold the majority of its loans through pooled commitments to national investors on a servicing released basis 
ufm originated all loans with the positive intent to sell 
loans held for sale were stated at the lower of cost or market locom 
the locom analysis on pools of homogeneous loans were applied on a net aggregate basis 
interest income with respect to loans held for sale was accrued on the principal amount outstanding 
locom valuation techniques applicable to loans held for sale were based on estimated market price indications for similar loans 
pricing estimates were established by participating mortgage purchasers and prevailing economic conditions 
the majority of the loans held for sale had established market pricing indications 
the loans held for sale portfolio at december  were million and they are now included in assets related to discontinued operations 
risks associated with this lending function included interest rate risk  which was mitigated through the utilization of financial instruments commonly referred to as derivatives to assist in offsetting the effect of changing interest rates 
the company accounted for these instruments in accordance with fasb statement no 
 as amended accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity 
this statement established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
ufm used forward mortgage contracts and options short position sales and options to manage interest rate risk in the pipeline of loans and interest rate lock commitments rlcs from the point of the loan commitment to the subsequent allocation and delivery to outside investors 
as a result of the timing from origination to sale  and the likelihood of changing interest rates  forward commitments and options were placed with counter parties to attempt to counter the effect of changing interest rates 
the options and forward commitments to sell securities are considered to be derivatives and  as such  were recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and the changes in fair value are reflected in discontinued operations within the consolidated statements of income 
the fair value of the rlcs is based on prevailing interest rates  expected servicing release premiums and the assumed probability of closing pull through 
the assumption of a given pull through percentage also enters into the determination of the volume of derivative contracts 
pull through assumptions are continually monitored for changes in the interest rate environment and characteristics of the pool of rlcs 
differences between pull through assumptions and actual pull through could result in a mismatch in the volume of security contracts corresponding to rlcs and lead to volatility in profit margins on the loan products ultimately delivered 
the foregoing discussion of derivatives and hedging relates to the historical operation of ufm which was sold in august accordingly  these risks and the accounting policies and assumptions associated with derivatives and hedging are no longer considered material to the company s continuing operations 
further discussion of the impact of loans held for sale and derivatives is included in footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions and intangible assets as part of its growth plan  the company engages in business combinations with other companies 
the acquisition of a business is generally accounted for under purchase accounting rules promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
purchase accounting requires the recording of underlying assets and liabilities of the entity acquired at their fair market value 
any excess of the purchase price of the business over the net assets acquired and any identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill 
fair values are assigned based on quoted prices for similar assets  if readily available  or appraisal by qualified independent parties for relevant asset and liability categories 
financial assets and liabilities are typically valued using 
table of contents discount models which apply current discount rates to streams of cash flow 
all of these valuation methods require the use of assumptions which can result in alternate valuations and varying levels of goodwill and  in some cases  amortization expense or accretion income 
management must also make estimates of useful or economic lives of certain acquired assets and liabilities 
these lives are used in establishing amortization and accretion of some intangible assets and liabilities  such as the intangible associated with core deposits acquired in the acquisition of a commercial bank 
goodwill is recorded as the excess of the purchase price  if any  over the fair value of the revalued net assets 
goodwill is tested at least annually in the month of november for possible impairment 
this testing again uses a discounted cash flow model applied to the anticipated stream of cash flows from operations of the business or segment being tested 
impairment testing necessarily uses estimates in the form of growth and attrition rates and anticipated rates of return 
these estimates have a direct bearing on the results of the impairment testing and serve as the basis for management s conclusions as to impairment 
in the fourth quarter of and in the second quarter of  the company used impairment testing by a third party as part of its conclusion that the mortgage segment of the business had been impaired 
this led to impairment charges expense in each of those quarters and the ultimate decision to sell the impaired business segment 
income taxes the establishment of provisions for federal and state income taxes is a complex area of accounting which also involves the use of judgments and estimates in applying relevant tax statutes 
the company operates in multiple state tax jurisdictions and this requires the appropriate allocation of income and expense to each state based on a variety of apportionment or allocation bases 
management strives to keep abreast of changes in tax law and the issuance of regulations which may impact tax reporting and provisions for income tax expense 
the company is also subject to audit by federal and state tax authorities 
results of these audits may produce indicated liabilities which differ from company estimates and provisions 
the company continually evaluates its exposure to possible tax assessments arising from audits and records its estimate of probable exposure based on current facts and circumstances 
recent acquisitions and branching activity on march   the company acquired pcb bancorp  inc  a tennessee chartered bank holding company pcb bancorp headquartered in johnson city  tennessee 
pcb bancorp has six full service branch offices located in johnson city  kingsport and surrounding areas in washington and sullivan counties in east tennessee 
at acquisition  pcb bancorp had total assets of million  total net loans of million and total deposits of million 
these resources were included in the company s financial statements beginning with the second quarter of under the terms of the merger agreement  shares of pcb bancorp common stock were purchased for per share in cash 
the total deal value  including the cash out of outstanding stock options  was approximately million 
concurrent with the pcb bancorp acquisition  peoples community bank  the wholly owned subsidiary of pcb bancorp  was merged into the bank 
as a result of the acquisition and preliminary purchase price allocation  approximately million in goodwill was recorded which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets acquired and identified intangibles 
late in the second quarter of  the company also established additional commercial lending offices in norfolk  virginia and blacksburg  virginia 
these new offices will assist in the development of commercial business in both the hampton roads and new river valley regions and will be supported by full service offices in nearby divisions 
in january  the bank completed the acquisition of stone capital  based in beckley  west virginia 
this acquisition expanded the bank s operations to include a broader range of financial services  including wealth management  asset allocation  financial planning and investment advice 
at december   stone capital had a total market value of assets under management of million 
stone capital was acquired 
table of contents through the issuance of  shares of company common stock  which represents of the total consideration 
in and stone capital exceeded the annual revenue requirement outlined in the acquisition agreement and additional shares were paid to the original shareholders 
the balance of the remaining consideration is payable on january  in the form of company common stock subject to revenue minimums outlined in the acquisition agreement 
in june  the company acquired commonwealth  a virginia chartered commercial bank for total consideration of approximately million 
the merger was accomplished through the exchange of 
shares of the company s common stock valued at  cash  or a combination of the company s stock and cash equivalent to for each share of commonwealth common stock 
at acquisition  commonwealth had total assets of million  net loans of million and total deposits of million 
as a result of the preliminary purchase price allocation  the million excess of purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets acquired and identified intangibles was recorded as goodwill 
in the second  third and fourth quarters of  the company opened three de novo branches in winston salem  north carolina 
in february  the company also established commercial loan offices in charlotte and mount airy  north carolina 
at present  these offices are not involved in deposit gathering activities 
however  they will assist in commercial real estate loan origination 
these offices are in the development stages and produced startup operating losses throughout most of near year end  certain of these offices began to produce monthly profits as business development efforts began to produce sufficient loan volume 
results of operations net income for was million  down million from million in and down million from net income of million 
basic and diluted earnings per share for were and  respectively  compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of and  respectively  in and and basic and diluted earnings per share  respectively  in a million net loss in the mortgage banking operation which has been reclassified as a loss from discontinued operations was the major factor impacting the company s earnings performance 
after absorbing additional costs associated with the opening of new branches and loan production offices  continuing operations reflected a decrease in net income of million  or in compared to the prior year and a million increase  or  compared to the loss from discontinued operations increased from million for the year ended december  to a loss of million in this loss included a charge off of the now discontinued mortgage segment goodwill of million 
the discontinued mortgage banking segment is discussed more fully later in this management s discussion 
the company s key profitability ratios of return on average assets roa and return on average equity roe compare favorably with the average of the company s national peer ratios of and  respectively  based on the september bank holding company performance report 
roa  which measures the company s stewardship of assets  was at  compared to in and in roe for the company was in  compared to in and in roa for continuing operations was in vs 
in  roe for continuing operations was in compared to in net interest income current year comparison vs 
the primary source of the company s earnings is net interest income  the difference between income on earning assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets 
significant categories of earning assets are loans and securities while deposits and short term borrowings represent the major portion of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income from continuing operations  the largest contributor to earnings  was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the corresponding period in for 
table of contents purposes of the following discussion  comparison of net interest income is done on a tax equivalent basis for continuing operations  which provides a common basis for comparing yields on earning assets exempt from federal income taxes to those which are fully taxable 
as indicated in table i  tax equivalent net interest income totaled million for  an increase of million from the million reported in this million increase includes a million increase due to an increase in earning assets  which were added to the portfolio at declining replacement rates 
this increase was partially offset by a net million reduction due to rate changes on the underlying assets and liabilities as asset yields fell in the declining rate environment 
management was able to help offset the effect of the declining asset yield through aggressive management of deposit rates 
average earning assets increased million while interest bearing liabilities increased million 
as indicated in table i  the yield on average earning assets decreased basis points from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this decrease was accompanied by a basis point decline in the cost of funds during the same periods 
as a result  the net interest rate spread the difference between interest income on earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities at december  was lower at compared to for the same period last year 
the company s tax equivalent net interest margin of for the year ended december  decreased basis points from in the largest contributor to the decrease in the yield on average earning assets in  on a volume weighted basis  was the decrease in the overall tax equivalent yield on loans held for investment of basis points from the prior year to  as loans repriced downward in response to the declining rate environment of the preceding year and continued low rates in the first half of the average balance increased million  largely due to the pcb acquisition in tennessee and expansion offices in north carolina 
the decline in asset yield is attributable to the recent interest rate environment which created refinancing or repricing incentives for fixed rate borrowers to lower their borrowing costs 
strong competition for commercial loans also held loan yields lower in during  the taxable equivalent yield on securities available for sale decreased basis points to while the average balance increased by million 
consistent with the current rate environment  the company and the securities industry as a whole have experienced rapid turnover in securities as higher yielding securities are either called or prepaid as the refinancing opportunity presented itself 
the increasing average security balance is the result of continued reinvestment of available funds 
the average balance of investment securities held to maturity decreased million  while the yield decreased basis points to 
securities held to maturity are largely comprised of tax free municipal securities 
compared to  average interest bearing balances with banks decreased million between and  while the yield increased basis points to 
the company actively manages its product pricing by staying abreast of the current economic climate and competitive forces in order to enhance repricing opportunities available with respect to the liability side of its balance sheet 
in doing so  the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by basis points from in to in while the average volume of interest bearing liabilities increased million 
compared to  the average balance of fhlb and other short term convertible and callable borrowings increased in by million to million while the rate decreased basis points to  the result of the addition of balances acquired with the commonwealth and pcb acquisitions  the addition of new advances at lower rates partially offset by the maturity of a million fhlb advance in december the average balance of all other borrowings increased million in compared to  the result of the issuance of million in subordinated debentures late in the third quarter of  while the rate paid decreased basis points 
in addition  the average balances of interest bearing demand and savings deposits increased million and million  respectively 
the average rate paid on demand deposits decreased by basis points while the average rate paid on savings increased by basis points the result of higher rates paid by pcb on certain money market accounts 
average time deposits increased million while the average rate paid decreased basis points from in to in the level of average non interest bearing demand deposits increased million to million at december  compared to average interest 
table of contents bearing deposits and non interest bearing demand deposits for the acquired commonwealth bank branches totaled million and million  respectively in and million and million  respectively in included in the average balances related to the pcb acquisition were interest bearing and non interest bearing deposits of million and million at december  prior year comparison vs 
net interest income from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the corresponding period in tax equivalent net interest income table i totaled million for  an increase of million from the million reported in this million increase includes a million increase due to an increase in earning assets 
this increase was partially offset by a million reduction due to rate changes on the underlying assets as asset yields fell in the declining rate environment 
average earning assets increased million while interest bearing liabilities increased million 
the yield on average earning assets decreased basis points from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  however  this decrease was largely offset by a basis point decline in the cost of funds during the same periods leaving the net interest rate spread at december  slightly lower at compared to for the company s tax equivalent net interest margin of for the year ended december  decreased basis points from in the largest contributor to the decrease in the yield on average earning assets in  on a volume weighted basis  was the decrease in the overall tax equivalent yield on loans held for investment of basis points from the prior year to  as loans repriced downward in response to the declining rate environment while the average balance increased million 
the decline in asset yield is attributable to the interest rate environment which created refinancing or repricing incentives for fixed rate borrowers to lower their current borrowing costs 
in addition  due to the volume of loans directly tied to prime and other indices that are either adjustable incrementally or are variable rate advances  asset yields declined in response to federal funds rate cuts and drops in the prime loan rate which began in and continued in during  the taxable equivalent yield on securities available for sale decreased basis points to while the average balance increased by million 
the increased average security balance was the result of continued reinvestment of available funds largely created by higher average deposit levels 
both the average balance and tax equivalent yield on investment securities held to maturity remained relatively stable with a slight increase in yield of basis points to and a million decrease in average balance from securities held to maturity are largely comprised of tax free municipal securities 
compared to  average interest bearing balances with banks increased million while the yield remained the same at 
this average balance increase was largely the result of funds received from new deposit growth in existing markets and deposits obtained in the acquisition of the bank of greenville in the fourth quarter of and commonwealth in june as well as the continued cash flow roll off experienced in the loan and investment portfolio 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by basis points from in to in while the average volume increased million 
average short term borrowings  increased million in when compared to  because of additional borrowings assumed in the acquisition of commonwealth and a general increase in the level of retail repurchase agreements  net of reclassifications to discontinued operations 
the average rate paid on these borrowings decreased basis points to in versus in average long term borrowings increased million as a result of the september issuance of million in trust preferred securities and the payment of an million advance from the fhlb 
the average rate paid on these borrowings decreased basis points in compared to in addition  the average balances of interest bearing demand and savings deposits increased and million  respectively  during while the corresponding average rate paid on these deposit categories declined and basis points  respectively 
average time deposits increased million while the average rate paid decreased basis points from in to in the level of average non interest bearing demand deposits increased million to million in compared to approximately 
table of contents million of the million increase in average interest bearing deposit growth is attributable to the acquisitions of the bank of greenville million in the fourth quarter of and commonwealth million in june  respectively 
commonwealth also contributed significant non interest bearing deposit balances with its high balance deposit product for title companies and real estate settlement firms

table of contents non interest income current year comparison vs 
non interest income consists of all revenues which are not included in interest and fee income related to earning assets 
total non interest income increased approximately million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the corresponding period in along with an increase in deposits stemming from bank charges on deposit accounts increased million or while other service charges  commissions and fees reflected gains of  or 
a or  improvement in other operating income in is due to several factors  including improvement in atm usage fees on foreign cards and an increase in commission income generated by stone capital management  inc stone capital asset management fees grew from  in to  in this growth reflects the initial stages of expansion of the retail asset management services under stone capital and its addition of investment advisors and the licensing of a number of investment associates within the bank branches 
during  the company realized a gain on sale of securities of approximately million due largely to the sale of million of corporate bonds held in the company s available for sale investment portfolio  the market value of which had declined in step with the flattening of the treasury yield curve 
the proceeds from the sale of these securities in the second quarter of provided sufficient liquidity to pay off overnight borrowings and assisted the company in funding increased loan demand 
these gains  along with smaller gains on securities called  compared to those of the same period of reflect a year over year increase of  fiduciary revenues  which include fees for trust services  increased  in versus the increase in fiduciary revenues in relates to both account and asset growth within the trust division which came under new management in early the increase in fiduciary revenues includes an increase of  in mutual fund shareholder service fees which were previously retained by an outsourced investment advisor and increased estate fees of  prior year comparison vs 
total non interest income from continuing operations increased approximately million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for gains on the sale of securities of million  or a year over year change of million was the largest contributor to this increase  almost entirely due to the sale of certain short term equity investments in the third quarter of service charges on deposit accounts increased million  or primarily as the result of the company s overdraft program that allows well managed customer deposit accounts flexibility in managing overdrafts to their accounts 
other service charges  commissions and fees also increased million in compared to these fees are dependent upon customer behaviors and usage of the various products and services of the company and are transaction oriented 
revenues in this category include  among others  commissions on sales of credit life insurance and other fee sources of revenue including the new revenues from stone capital of  and an increase in atm service charge revenues of  partially generated in the new market areas 
fiduciary earnings representing asset management fees on trust and agency accounts of million were consistent with the prior year 
all other operating income increased  non interest expense current year comparison vs 
total non interest expense from continuing operations was million  an increase of or million for over a million or increase in salaries and benefits and a million increase in other operating expenses account for of this increase  resulting from the company s expansion into blacksburg  virginia  eastern virginia  east tennessee  and charlotte  winston salem and mount airy  
table of contents north carolina 
this expansion brings with it the associated costs of additional branch personnel  corporate services and support  added technology and infrastructure as further detailed below 
the million increase in salaries and benefits includes the addition of commonwealth bank in june million  the acquisition of pcb in the second quarter of million  the salaries and benefits associated with three north carolina de novo branches opened in late and the opening of two new north carolina loan production offices in the first quarter of million  and three new loan production offices in virginia and west virginia  as well as a general increase in salaries and benefits as staffing needs at several locations were satisfied in order to support added corporate services and continued branch growth 
occupancy and furniture and fixture expenses increased  and  respectively  compared to for a total of million 
the general level of occupancy and equipment costs grew largely as a result of the commonwealth acquisition  the pcb bancorp acquisition  increases in depreciation and insurance costs associated with new de novo branches  and depreciation associated with continued investment in operating equipment and technology infrastructure 
all other operating expense accounts increased million in compared to significant increases were related to the additional costs associated with the opening of three new branches in winston salem and two loan production offices in charlotte and mount airy  north carolina  the opening of three loan production offices in virginia and west virginia  the acquisition of commonwealth in richmond  virginia  and the tennessee acquisition of pcb bancorp 
other operational and data processing expenses also increased as a result of the acquisition and branching activity  such as correspondent bank fees  insurance  courier and fdic occ assessments 
the company has  for many years  used a traditional efficiency ratio that is a non gaap financial measure of operating expense control and efficiency of operations 
management believes that its traditional ratio better focuses attention on the operating performance of the company over time than does a gaap based ratio  and is highly useful in comparing period to period operating performance of the company s core business operations 
it is used by management as part of its assessment of its performance in managing non interest expenses 
however  this measure is supplemental  and is not a substitute for an analysis of performance based on gaap measures 
the reader is cautioned that the traditional efficiency ratio used by the company may not be comparable to gaap or non gaap efficiency ratios reported by other financial institutions 
in general  the efficiency ratio is non interest expenses as a percentage of net interest income plus non interest income 
non interest expenses used in the calculation of the traditional  non gaap efficiency ratio exclude amortization of goodwill and intangibles and non recurring expenses 
income for the traditional ratio is increased for the favorable effect of tax exempt income see table i  and excludes securities gains and losses  which vary widely from period to period without appreciably affecting operating expenses  and non recurring gains 
the measure is different from the gaap based efficiency ratio  which also is presented in this report 
the gaap based measure is calculated using non interest expense and income amounts as shown on the face of the consolidated statements of income 
the gaap and traditional based efficiency ratios are reconciled in the table below 
the efficiency ratios for continuing operations for   and were   and  respectively 
increases in the current year is reflective of the higher direct costs associated with the 
table of contents acquisitions and new offices in and and added corporate overhead required to support company expansion

non interest expense from continuing operations totaled million for increasing million  or over year end this increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in salaries and benefits as a result of the addition of greenville in late  the addition of commonwealth in june  as well as a general increase in salaries and benefits as staffing needs at several locations were satisfied in order to support added corporate services and continued branch growth  including three newly established branches in winston salem  north carolina 
in  occupancy and furniture and equipment expense increased by  compared to the general level of occupancy cost grew largely as a result of the greenville  and commonwealth acquisitions  as well as increases in depreciation and insurance costs associated with new de novo branches  and depreciation associated with a significant investment in operating equipment and technology infrastructure 
all other operating expense accounts increased  or in compared to this increase was largely attributable to the bank of greenville acquisition in late and the commonwealth acquisition along with the three de novo branches opened in the second  third and fourth quarters of income tax expense income tax expense is comprised of federal and state current and deferred income taxes on pre tax earnings of the company 
income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income may vary significantly from statutory rates due to items of income and expense which are excluded  by law  from the calculation of taxable income 
these items are commonly referred to as permanent differences 
the most significant permanent differences for the company include i income on state and municipal securities which are exempt from federal income tax  ii certain dividend payments which are deductible by the company  iii for and  goodwill impairment expense which is not deductible  and iv for the third quarter of  the loss on 
table of contents the sale of the ufm subsidiary which had a significant tax basis over and above its book carrying value 
the two latter items are reflected in the tax benefit from discontinued operations in and state and municipal bond income represents the most significant permanent difference that occurs on a regular basis 
goodwill impairment expense is infrequent and has historically been related to the ufm subsidiary  which was sold in august the difference related to the excess tax over book basis of the ufm subsidiary was a one time event linked to the sale of the mortgage subsidiary 
this item resulted in a substantial reduction in the effective income tax rate for this difference arose due to the non deductible goodwill impairment charges associated with the sale of the ufm subsidiary 
because those charges expenses were not deductible  they resulted in permanent differences which increased the effective tax rate in and the first two quarters of goodwill expense  by its very nature  is a permanent difference 
these expenses did  however  reduce the carrying basis of the mortgage subsidiary and resulted in a permanent difference tax affect of approximately  in the third quarter of upon the sale of the entity  which reduced the combined effective tax in to from in income tax expense is classified according to continuing operations and discontinued operations 
the  tax benefit associated with the loss on the sale of ufm is included in income tax benefit discontinued operations on the income statement 
throughout  the company has been engaged in a state tax audit involving state income  franchise and sales tax in one of its state tax jurisdictions 
while the company has received early indications of the state tax department s estimates of potential additional state income and franchise tax liabilities  the company s review of the potential assessments revealed a position which favors the company and which  if sustained  could result in the company receiving state income and franchise tax refunds 
the company and tax counsel continue to evaluate possible exposure under the state tax audit as well as the referenced favorable tax position and believe that the company has established appropriate provisions for state income and franchise taxes consistent with the uncertainty of the state tax audit and changes in the company s state tax filings 
financial position securities held to maturity investment securities held to maturity are comprised largely of us agency obligations and state and municipal bonds 
obligations of states and political subdivisions represent the largest portion of the held to maturity portfolio which totaled million at december  these are comprised of high grade municipal securities generally carrying aaa bond ratings  most of which also carry credit enhancement insurance by major insurers of investment obligations 
the average final maturity of the investment portfolio decreased from years in to years in with the tax equivalent yield decreasing from at year end to at the close of the average maturity of the investment portfolio  based on market assumptions for prepayment  is years and years at december and  respectively 
the average maturity data differs from final maturity data because of the use of assumptions as to anticipated prepayments

this change reflects the purchase of million in securities  million in maturities and calls  proceeds from sales of million  the acquisition of million in securities with the pcb bancorp purchase  a market value decrease of approximately million  the continuation of larger pay downs of million on mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations triggered by the low interest rate environment and approximately million in bond premium amortization 
the average final maturity of the available for sale portfolio was years at december  compared to years at december  although substantial reinvestment has been made in the available for sale security portfolio  the company has attempted to maintain a shorter portfolio duration the cash weighted term to maturity of the portfolio to reduce the sensitivity of the portfolio to changes in interest rates and lessen interest rate risk 
the longer the duration  the greater the impact of changing market rates for similar instruments 
at december   the estimated average life of the investment portfolio was years reflective of currently anticipated prepayments for both and securities available for sale are recorded at their estimated fair market value 
the unrealized gain or loss  which is the difference between amortized cost and estimated market value  net of related deferred taxes  is recognized in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
the unrealized gains after taxes of million at december   represent a decrease of million from the million gain at december   the result of market value depreciation in reaction to rate movements on similar instruments as well as gains realized on sales in the fair value of a security is determined based on quoted market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on quoted prices of similar instruments 
available for sale and held to maturity securities are reviewed quarterly for possible other than temporary impairment 
this review includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each individual investment such as the length of time the fair value has been below cost  the expectation for that security s performance  the credit worthiness of the issuer and the registrant s intent and ability to hold the security to recovery or maturity 
a decline in value that is considered to be other than temporary is recorded as a loss within non interest income in the consolidated statements of income

loan portfolio loans held for sale as mentioned previously in this report  ufm was sold during the third quarter the loans held for sale by ufm in prior periods are carried as assets related to discontinued operations on the balance sheet million at december  and have been removed from continuing operations 
the remaining million balance of loans held for sale at december  is held by the bank  largely resulting from the pcb acquisition 
the tennessee branches sell these longer term loans to an investor on a best efforts basis  accordingly  the company does not absorb the interest rate risk involved in the loan commitment

table of contents allowance and provision for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by charges to earnings in the form of provisions for loan losses and recoveries of prior loan charge offs  and decreased by loans charged off 
the provision for loan losses is calculated to bring the allowance to a level  which  according to a systematic process of measurement  is reflective of the required amount needed to absorb probable losses 
management performs monthly assessments to determine the appropriate level of allowance 
differences between actual loan loss experience and estimates are reflected through adjustments that are made by either increasing or decreasing the loss provision based upon current measurement criteria 
commercial  consumer and mortgage loan portfolios are evaluated separately for purposes of determining the allowance 
the specific components of the allowance include allocations to individual commercial credits and allocations to the remaining non homogeneous and homogeneous pools of loans 
management s allocations are based on judgment of qualitative and quantitative factors about both the macro and micro economic conditions reflected within the portfolio of loans and the economy as a whole 
factors considered in this evaluation include  but are not necessarily limited to  probable losses from loan and other credit arrangements  general economic conditions  changes in credit concentrations or pledged collateral  historical loan loss experience  and trends in portfolio volume  maturity  composition  delinquencies  and non accruals 
while management has attributed the allowance for loan losses to various portfolio segments  the allowance is available for the entire portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses was million on december   compared to million at december  and million on december  the allowance for loan losses represents of non performing loans at december   versus and at december  and  respectively 
when other real estate is combined with non performing loans  the allowance equals of non performing assets at december  versus and at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in the allowance since december is primarily attributable to the acquisition of pcb bancorp  new loan volume and changes in various qualitative risk factors specific to that portfolio 
the allowance attributable to the pcb bancorp portfolio at the date of acquisition was million 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  decreased  when compared to the year ended december  the decrease is largely attributable to improving asset quality and loan loss history  changes in risk factors and a decline in volume within certain portfolio segments

potential problems loans in addition to loans which are classified as non performing  the company closely monitors certain loans which could develop into problem loans 
these potential problem loans present characteristics of weakness or concentrations of credit to one borrower 
among these loans at december  was a loan of million which warrants close monitoring of a borrower within the hospitality industry 
the loan represents the retained portion of a million total loan shared with a participating bank 
the loan is secured by real estate improved with a national franchise hotel and parking building in a major southeast city 
the loan is further secured by the guarantee of the principals of the borrowing entity certain of which are considered to be substantial 
this loan  which was originated in  performed according to terms until it displayed delinquency in february and march and was subsequently brought current 
the loan remains current as to principal and interest at december  this loan does  however  represent one of the company s largest credits and is within an industry which has suffered from declining performance in recent years 
this loan was appropriately considered in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and there were no specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses for the foregoing potential problem loan as of december  the company had no foreign outstanding loans at december  although the company s loans are made primarily in the four state region in which it operates  the company had no concentrations of loans to one borrower or industry representing or more of outstanding loans at december  deposits total deposits grew by million or during  largely as a result of the pcb acquisition in april  million 
non interest bearing deposits increased million million pcb bancorp acquisition or

this category of liabilities represents wholesale sources of funding and liquidity for the company 
short term borrowings increased on average approximately million compared to the prior year as a result of continued loan demand and increases in portfolio assets 
the increase in average short term borrowings in  along with the increase in average deposits of million  was accompanied by an increase in total loans as these funds were used to finance the average loans held for investment portfolio growth million and the average increase in available for sale securities million 
the price sensitivity of funding cost is managed by the company s product group  which monitors product and pricing initiatives including  among other things  the management of the overall cost of funds to assist in maintaining an acceptable net interest margin  and to act as a resource in developing new products and establishing pricing guidelines

liquidity and capital resources liquidity represents the company s ability to respond to demands for funds and is primarily derived from maturing investment securities  overnight investments  periodic repayment of loan principal  and the company s ability to generate new deposits 
the company also has the ability to attract short term sources of funds and draw on credit lines that have been established at financial institutions to meet cash needs 
total liquidity of million at december  is comprised of the following cash on hand and deposits with other financial institutions of million  securities available for sale of million  securities held to maturity due within one year of  and federal home loan bank credit availability of million 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the bank s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income nii  which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and its interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets re price differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the bank manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity  and coordinating its sources and uses of funds while maintaining an acceptable level of nii given the current interest rate environment 
the company s primary component of operational revenue  nii  is subject to variation as a result of changes in interest rate environments in conjunction with unbalanced re pricing opportunities on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk has four primary components including re pricing risk  basis risk  yield curve risk and option risk 
re pricing risk occurs when earning assets and paying liabilities re rice at differing times as interest rates change 
basis risk occurs when the underlying rates on the assets and liabilities the institution holds change at different levels or in varying degrees 
yield curve risk is the risk of adverse consequences as a result of unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities for the same instrument 
lastly  option risk is due to embedded options often called put or call options given or sold to holders of financial instruments 
in order to mitigate the effect of changes in the general level of interest rates  the company manages re pricing opportunities and thus  its interest rate sensitivity 
the bank seeks to control its interest rate risk irr exposure to insulate net interest income and net earnings from fluctuations in the general level of interest rates 
to measure its exposure to irr  quarterly simulations of nii are performed using financial models that project nii through a range of possible interest rate environments including rising  declining  most likely and flat rate scenarios 
the results of these simulations indicate the existence and severity of irr in each of those rate environments based upon the current balance sheet position  assumptions as to changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest paying liabilities and management s estimate of yields to be attained in those future rate environments and rates that will be paid on various deposit instruments and borrowings 
specific strategies for management of irr have included shortening the amortized maturity of new fixed rate loans  increasing the volume of adjustable rate loans to reduce the average maturity of the bank s interest earning assets and monitoring the term structure of liabilities to maintain a balanced mix of maturity and re pricing structures to mitigate the potential exposure 
the simulation model used by the company captures all earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and all off balance sheet financial instruments and combines the various factors affecting rate sensitivity into an earnings outlook 
based upon the latest simulation  the company believes that it is biased toward an asset sensitive 
table of contents position 
absent adequate management  asset sensitive positions can negatively impact net interest income in a falling rate environment or  alternatively  positively impact net interest income in a rising rate environment 
the company has established policy limits for tolerance of interest rate risk that allow for no more than a reduction in projected nii based on quarterly income simulations compared to forecasted results 
in addition  the policy addresses exposure limits to changes in the economic value of equity eve according to predefined policy guidelines 
the most recent simulation indicates that current exposure to interest rate risk is within the company s defined policy limits as short term rates are anticipated to continue to move upward throughout the following table summarizes the impact on nii and the eve as of december  and  respectively  of immediate and sustained rate shocks in the interest rate environment of plus and minus basis points and plus basis points from the flat rate simulation 
the results of the rate shock analysis depicted below differ from the results in quarterly simulations  in that all changes are assumed to take effect immediately  whereas  in the quarterly income simulations  changes in interest rates are assumed to take place over a month horizon simulating a more likely scenario for a changing rate environment 
this table  which illustrates the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes  is based upon numerous assumptions including relative and estimated levels of key interest rates over a twelve month time period 
this type of modeling technique  although useful  does not take into account all strategies that management might undertake in response to a sudden and sustained rate shock as depicted 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
rate sensitivity analysis change in change in net interest market value increase decrease in interest rates basis points income change of equity change amounts in thousands change in change in net interest market value increase decrease in interest rates basis points income change of equity change amounts in thousands when comparing the impact of the rate shock analysis between and  the changes in nii reflect relatively similar results and the impact of the balance sheet composition of assets and liabilities as the profile continues to reflect asset sensitivity 
as a result  the simulation scenario in a falling rate environment depicts net interest income declining and the opposite occurs in a rising environment 
the asset sensitivity is reflected in on hand liquidity of million federal funds sold and interest bearing balances held with other banks and in the loan portfolio which contained adjustable or variable rates on about of the portfolio at december  coupled with the relatively short duration of the investment portfolio and rapid asset prepayment within the portfolio  this creates an asset sensitive position favoring a rising rate environment 
the company began to experience a shift in the balance sheet toward greater asset sensitivity in which was attributed to the reduced lives of certain assets and the control measures taken in prior years  
table of contents and continuing throughout  to reduce deposit cost and identify opportunities for product and net interest income enhancement in response to changes in rate environments 
the market value of equity is a measure which reflects the impact of changing rates of the underlying values of the company in various rate scenarios 
the scenarios illustrate the potential estimated impact of instantaneous rate shocks on the underlying value of equity 
the current year results are more impacted by the re pricing of assets which occurred in the prior years as well as the impact of rising rates on the non maturity deposits which generally tend to be relatively inelastic less sensitive to change but may shift  as modeled  to more elasticity as rate pressures cause deposit re pricing of these instruments
