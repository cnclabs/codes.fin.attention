critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments are as follows allowance for loan losses arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the company s allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as well as the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
for a full discussion of the company s methodology of assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  see the allowance for loan loss and provision for loan loss sections within the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation to follow 
income taxes the company estimates income tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note of the consolidated financial statements 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
although the company uses available information to record accrued income taxes  underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances such as changes in tax laws influencing the company s overall tax position

in  as compared to  the company experienced compression in its net interest margin  some of which began to reverse in the second half of the compression in the first half of was driven by two factors 
first  existing fixed rate assets were being replaced with new assets being priced in a lower rate environment 
second  demand for deposits and therefore competitive pricing for deposits began to increase 
however  in the second half of the company benefited from a continued focus on adjustable rate lending as the federal reserve began to raise rates thus repricing adjustable rate loans higher  resulting in a modest expansion in the net interest margin

in item hereof effective march  the net interest margin for prior periods shown above have not been adjusted to reflect the adoption of this interpretation 
during this historically low interest rate environment  management has focused greater effort  as shown below  on the origination of variable and adjustable rate loans 
the following represents the change in mix of variable rate loans and fixed rate loans from through mix of variable and fixed rate loans mix of variable and fixed loans pie charts includes fixed rate commercial real estate loans  the majority of which reprice after years 
this emphasis on adjustable lending resulted in a modest expansion in the company s net interest margin in the second half of  from a low of in the second quarter to in the fourth quarter of the year 
following increases in fed funds and the prime rate  the company was able to increase the yield on interest bearing assets  without a corresponding increase in the cost of deposits 

table of contents the following shows the historical prime lending rate from though historical prime lending rate historical prime lending rate graph source bloomberg lp net interest income increased million during as compared to  despite a reduction in the net interest margin  primarily as a result of strong loan growth during the year 
to diversify earnings and mitigate the impact to the net interest margin compression the company focuses on non interest income opportunities 
during service charges on deposit accounts increased by  or  as compared to as a result of the strong growth in core deposits experienced during the year 
this increase was offset however in mortgage banking income  which experienced a decline of million  or  as a result of the inevitable slowdown in the refinance market experienced during management believes that despite the downturn in mortgage banking income in  the retooling that has taken place in the residential lending division will better position the company to focus on the purchase mortgage market going forward 
investment management services income increased by  or  attributable to the growth in managed assets

salaries and employee benefits increased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year partially reflecting additions to staff to support continued growth as well as increased pension and medical expenses  partially offset by lower incentive compensation 
other non interest expenses increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the increase in other non interest expenses is primarily attributable to expenditures associated with the company s key business initiatives 
the company estimates that the total cost associated with its business initiatives was approximately million in in addition  advertising and business development increased by  in compared to to support the aforementioned business initiatives and capitalize on market changes due to merger and acquisition activity 
looking ahead to  the company expects the net interest margin to contract modestly to for the year 
the additional margin compression is a result of an anticipated increase in funding costs and the run off of deferred gains on sales of interest rate swaps that were amortized into interest income on home equity loans 
management plans to mitigate the impact of net interest margin compression through continued prudent asset growth  increasing deposit originations  generating growth in non interest income  and non interest expense control 
additionally  there are a number of initiatives that are expected to contribute to

table of contents loans secured by recreational vehicles  motor homes  boats  mobile homes  and motorcycles and cash reserve loans 
cash reserve loans are designed to afford the bank s customers overdraft protection 
cash reserve loans are made pursuant to previously approved unsecured cash reserve lines of credit 
the rate on these loans is subject to change due to market conditions 
as of december  and  million had been committed to but was unused under cash reserve lines of credit 
home equity loans may be made as a term loan or under a revolving line of credit secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower s residence 
as of december   there were million in unused commitments under revolving home equity lines of credit compared to million at december  the following table sets forth the scheduled contractual amortization of the bank s loan portfolio at december  loans having no schedule of repayments or no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less

generally  the actual maturity of loans is substantially shorter than their contractual maturity due to prepayments and  in the case of real estate loans  due on sale clauses  which generally gives the bank the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that  among other things  the borrower sells the property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of real estate loans tends to increase when current real estate loan rates are higher than rates on mortgages in the portfolio and  conversely  tends to decrease when rates on mortgages in the portfolio are higher than current real estate loan rates 
under the latter scenario  the weighted average yield on the portfolio tends to decrease as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates 
due to the fact that the bank may  consistent with industry practice  roll over a significant portion of commercial and commercial real estate loans at or immediately prior to their maturity by renewing the loans on substantially similar or revised terms  the principal repayments actually received by the bank are anticipated to be significantly less than the amounts contractually due in any particular period 
in addition  a loan  or a portion of a loan  may not be repaid due to the borrower s inability to satisfy the contractual obligations of the loan 
residential mortgage loans originated for sale are classified as held for sale 
these loans are specifically identified and carried at the lower of aggregate cost or estimated market value 
forward commitments to sell residential real estate mortgages are contracts that the bank enters into for the purpose of reducing the market risk associated with originating loans for sale should interest rates change 
forward commitments to sell as well as commitments to originate rate locked loans are recorded at fair value

asset quality rockland trust company actively manages all delinquent loans in accordance with formally drafted policies and established procedures 
in addition  rockland trust company s board of directors reviews delinquency statistics  by loan type  on a monthly basis 
delinquency the bank s philosophy toward managing its loan portfolios is predicated upon careful monitoring which stresses early detection and response to delinquent and default situations 
the bank seeks to make arrangements to resolve any delinquent or default situation over the shortest possible time frame 
generally  the bank requires that a delinquency notice be mailed to a borrower upon expiration of a grace period typically no longer than days beyond the due date 
reminder notices and telephone calls may be issued prior to the expiration of the grace period 
if the delinquent status is not resolved within a reasonable time frame following the mailing of a delinquency notice  the bank s personnel charged with managing its loan portfolios  contacts the borrower to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for payment 
any subsequent actions taken to resolve the delinquency will depend upon the nature of the loan and the length of time that the loan has been delinquent 
the borrower s needs are considered as much as reasonably possible without jeopardizing the bank s position 
a late charge is usually assessed on loans upon expiration of the grace period 
on loans secured by one to four family  owner occupied properties  the bank attempts to work out an alternative payment schedule with the borrower in order to avoid foreclosure action 
if such efforts do not result in a satisfactory arrangement  the loan is referred to legal counsel whereupon counsel initiates foreclosure proceedings 
at any time prior to a sale of the property at foreclosure  the bank may and will terminate foreclosure proceedings if the borrower is able to work out a satisfactory payment plan 
on loans secured by commercial real estate or other business assets  the bank similarly seeks to reach a satisfactory payment plan so as to avoid foreclosure or liquidation

in addition  certain commercial and real estate loans that are more than days past due may be kept on an accruing status if the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
as a general rule  a commercial or real estate loan more than days past due with respect to principal or interest is classified as a nonaccrual loan 
income accruals are suspended on all nonaccrual loans and all previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against current income 
a loan remains on nonaccrual status until it becomes current with respect to principal and in certain instances remains current

in the course of resolving nonperforming loans  the bank may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain commercial and real estate loans 
terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status 
it is the bank s policy to maintain restructured loans on nonaccrual status for approximately six months before management considers its return to accrual status 
at december   the bank had  of restructured loans 
at december   the bank had four potential problem loan relationships not included in nonperforming loans with an outstanding balance of million 
at december   the bank had two potential problem loans not included in nonperforming loans with an outstanding balance of million 
potential problem loans are any loans  which are not included in nonaccrual or non performing loans and which are not considered troubled debt restructures  where known information about possible credit problems of the borrowers causes management to have concerns as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms

table of contents remaining principal balance or the estimated fair value of the property acquired  less estimated costs to sell 
any loan balance in excess of the estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell on the date of transfer is charged to the allowance for loan losses on that date

a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial  commercial real estate  and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  the bank does not separately identify individual  consumer  or residential loans for impairment disclosures 
at december   impaired loans include all commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans on nonaccrual status and restructured loans 
total impaired loans at december  and were million and million  respectively 
allowance for loan losses while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on increases in nonperforming loans  changes in economic conditions  or for other reasons 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
federal reserve regulators examined the company in the third quarter of and the bank was most recently examined by the federal deposit insurance corporation  fdic  in the first quarter of no additional provision for loan losses was required as a result of these examinations 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to provide for probable loan losses based upon evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
additionally  in the bank s allowance increased by  upon acquisition of falmouth bankcorp  inc this increase represents management s estimate of potential inherent losses in the acquired portfolio

table of contents million to million at december   with increases shown in each of the various loan portfolio components except commercial and industrial loans  which decreased in increased amounts of allowance were allocated to six major portfolio components commercial real estate  real estate construction  residential real estate  consumer home equity  consumer auto and consumer other 
the increased amounts allocated to these portfolio components represented substantially all of the increase in the allocated allowance amounts  as compared to the amounts shown at december  the decrease in the amount of allowance allocated to the commercial and industrial portfolio component is attributed to the re categorization of certain loan balances and to portfolio turnover 
additionally  those loan balances in certain commercial and industrial loan groupings that have been repaid were replaced by newly originated loan balances that have been placed into other loan groupings within this portfolio component that require different levels of allocated allowance based upon the ascertainable risk characteristics of those loans 
the increase in the amount of allowance allocated to the commercial real estate portfolio component is due to loan balance growth within this portfolio component attributed to new loan origination and  to a certain extent  the falmouth acquisition 
loan balances outstanding in this portfolio component  at december   increased by  while the amount of allowance allocated to this portfolio component grew by  as compared to those respective amounts shown at december  the amount of allowance allocated reflects concerted increases in loan balances distributed among certain loan groupings within commercial real estate that require different levels of allocated allowance based upon the ascertainable risk characteristics of those loans 
the increase in the amount of allowance allocated to the real estate construction portfolio component is due to loan balance growth within this portfolio component attributed to new loan origination 
loan balances outstanding in this portfolio component  at december   increased by  while the corresponding amount of allowance allocated increased by  as compared to those respective amounts shown at december  the amount of allowance allocated within the real estate construction portfolio component reflects loan balance growth distributed among certain loan groupings within this portfolio component that require different levels of allocated allowance based upon the ascertainable risk characteristics of those loans

outstanding balances at december  in this loan category  excluding construction loans  grew by as compared to the amount shown at december  the increase in the amount of allowance allocated to the consumer home equity portfolio component is due to growth in this loan portfolio attributed to new loan origination and  to a certain extent  the falmouth acquisition 
outstanding balances at december  in this loan category grew by as compared to the amount shown at december  the increase in the amount of allowance allocated to the consumer auto loan portfolio component reflects growth in loan balances  which was led by the indirect financing subsets of this portfolio component

the formula based approach evaluates groups of loans to determine the allocation appropriate within each portfolio segment 
individual loans within the commercial and industrial  commercial real estate and real estate construction loan portfolio segments are assigned internal risk ratings to group them with other loans possessing similar risk characteristics 
the level of allowance allocable to each group of risk rated loans is then determined by management applying a loss factor that estimates the amount of probable loss inherent in each category 
the assigned loss factor for each risk rating is a formula based assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions  past experience and management s analysis of considerations of probable loan loss based on these factors 
a similar formula based approach  using a point in time credit grade distribution  was developed to evaluate the consumer installment segment of the loan portfolio 
this method was developed in response both to the significance of the balance and the seasoning of this segment of the portfolio which has allowed for a more analytical overview of its inherent risk characteristics 
this method has been combined with subjective factors  which reflect changing environmental conditions in the consumer installment loan market 
allocations for residential real estate and other consumer loan categories are principally determined by applying loss factors that represent management s estimate of probable or expected losses inherent in those categories 
in each segment  inherent losses are estimated  based on a formula based assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions  past loan loss experience and management s considerations of probable loan loss based on these factors 
the other method used to allocate allowances for loan losses entails the assignment of allowance amounts to individual loans on the basis of loan impairment 
certain loans are evaluated individually and are judged to be impaired when management believes it is probable that the bank will not collect all of the contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
under this method  loans are selected for evaluation based upon a change in internal risk rating  occurrence of delinquency  loan classification or non accrual status 
a specific allowance amount is allocated to an individual loan when such loan has been deemed impaired and when the amount of a probable loss is able to be estimated on the basis of a 
fair value of collateral  b 
present value of anticipated future cash flows or c 
the loan s observable fair market price 
loans with a specific allowance and the amount of such allowance totaled million and  respectively at december  and  and  respectively  at december  
table of contents a portion of the allowance for loan loss is not allocated to any specific segment of the loan portfolio 
this non specific allowance is maintained for two primary reasons a 
there exists an inherent subjectivity and imprecision to the analytical processes employed and b 
the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
moreover  management has identified certain risk factors  which could impact the degree of loss sustained within the portfolio 
these include a 
market risk factors  such as the effects of economic variability on the entire portfolio  and b 
unique portfolio risk factors that are inherent characteristics of the bank s loan portfolio 
market risk factors may consist of changes to general economic and business conditions that may impact the bank s loan portfolio customer base in terms of ability to repay and that may result in changes in value of underlying collateral 
unique portfolio risk factors may include industry concentration or covariant industry concentrations  geographic concentrations or trends that may exacerbate losses resulting from economic events which the bank may not be able to fully diversify out of its portfolio 
due to the imprecise nature of the loan loss estimation process and ever changing conditions  these risk attributes may not be adequately captured in data related to the formula based loan loss components used to determine allocations in the bank s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
management  therefore  has established and maintains an imprecision allowance for loan losses 
the amount of this measurement imprecision allocation was million at december   compared to million at december  management has decreased the measurement imprecision allocation primarily based upon its assessment of the effects of changing economic conditions on borrowers in its loan portfolio 
through the fiscal year ending december   the general state of the us economy has exhibited slow expansion  as measured by gross domestic product gdp  coupled with a lack of meaningful improvement in the level of unemployment  following a period of well publicized weakness 
national economic conditions notwithstanding  the credit quality of the bank s loan portfolio has remained stable and the incidence of default within the portfolio has not increased through the year ended december  as of december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million as compared to million at december  based on the processes described above  management believes that the level of the allowance for possible loan losses at december  is adequate
