item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations operations overview we operate as a provider of air pollution control products and services marketed under the kirk blum  ceco filters  cecoaire  busch international  ceco abatement systems  kbd technic and k b duct trade names 
our business is focused on engineering  designing  and building equipment  and installing systems that capture  clean and destroy airborne contaminants from industrial facilities as well as equipment that controls emissions from such facilities 
we have a diversified base of more than  active customers among a myriad of industries including aerospace  brick  cement  ceramics  metalworking  printing  paper  food  foundries  metal plating  woodworking  chemicals  tobacco  glass  automotive  and pharmaceuticals 
therefore  our business is not concentrated in a single industry or customer 
we operate under a hub and spoke business model in which executive management  finance  administrative and marketing staff serves as the hub while the sales channels serve as spokes 
we use this model throughout our operations 
this has provided us with certain efficiencies over a more decentralized model 
although we discuss four principal product lines  our operating units function as internal customers and suppliers of each others products and services and as such  products and services are intermingled in one major project 
as a result  it is not reasonably possible to segregate revenues to external customers  operating profits or identifiable assets by product line 
we have expanded our business by adding ceco abatement systems  cecoaire and k b duct while divesting of the operating assets of air purator corporation in and busch martec in neither were strategically important to us 
much of our business is driven by various regulatory standards and guidelines governing air quality in and outside factories 
favorable conditions in the economy generally lead to plant expansions and construction of new industrial sites 
economic expansion provides us with the potential to increase and accelerate levels of growth 
however  as we have seen in the past two years  in a weak economy customers tend to lengthen the time between inquiry and order or may defer purchases 
we have made significant strides in reducing our leverage through cash generated by operations and asset sales  which has reduced our debt carrying costs 
we ended with senior debt of million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december results of operations our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and reflect our operations consolidated with the operations of our subsidiaries

in  the individual larger contracts decreased slightly 
orders booked in were million compared with million in the large increase in bookings was due to the strengthening in the economy in the second half of the year coupled with several large orders booked in  including work for a steel production facility  an ethanol processing facility and an aluminum recycling facility 
we have experienced an increased level of customer inquiry and quoting activities in the later half of relative to the first half of this may be partially attributable to a perceived improvement in the economy by our customers  which could result in increased air quality related capital spending 
this favorable trend could lead to an increase in our future sales 
gross profit excluding depreciation and amortization was million in compared with million in gross profit  as a percentage of sales  was in compared to in the slight decrease was due to our product mix and lower margins realized in our contracting operations coupled with increasing material costs 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million to million in selling and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues for and were 
the cost reduction initiatives we implemented in and have helped to stabilize these costs at the current volume level 
depreciation and amortization remained constant at million for both years 
this was due primarily to reduced capital expenditures during periods of lower liquidity 
operating income was million in and million in the decrease in operating income resulting from the higher cost of materials was offset by lower factory overhead spending  which helped to mitigate the reduction in operating income 
other income for the year ended december  was  compared with income of  during the same period of the other income for the year ended december  was primarily a dividend of  from factory power which was a partnership with an adjacent manufacturing company to provide power to some of the other companies in the industrial park 
the partnership no longer provides any services to the area and will be liquidated 
other income for the year ended december  is the result of the gain recognized from the sale and leaseback of our conshohocken  pennsylvania property 
a deferred gain of million is being recognized over the ensuing three year leaseback period 
interest expense remained constant at million during compared to the same period of this was due to lower debt outstanding during the year offset by higher interest rates 
federal and state income tax benefit was  during compared with a tax benefit of  for the same period in the effective income tax rate for was compared with in the same period of the effective tax rate during was favorably affected by state tax benefits and exports sales and negatively affected by certain permanent differences including non deductible interest expense 
net loss was  in and  in vs

in  the individual larger contracts were down because of the continuing weakness in the us economy 
additionally  sales were higher resulting from the following a several large projects included in our december  backlog that were completed in including work performed for ethanol processing facilities and a specialty textile manufacturer  and b sales generated by large orders booked in including work performed for a large testing facility  a cement manufacturing facility and a major automotive manufacturer 
net sales during the year ended december  included  revenue generated from operations divested in orders booked in were million compared with million in the decline in bookings was due to the weakness in the economy coupled with several large orders booked in that were not replaced with comparably sized orders in including orders booked for a rockwool insulation manufacturing plant  a large testing facility  a cement manufacturing facility and for a major automotive manufacturer 
we have experienced an increased level of customer inquiry and quoting activities in the later half of relative to the first half of this may be partially attributable to a perceived improvement in the economy by our customers  which could result in increased air quality related capital spending 
this favorable trend could lead to an increase in our future sales 
gross profit excluding depreciation and amortization was million in compared with million in gross profit  as a percentage of sales  was in compared to in the decline was due to our product mix and higher margins realized in our contracting operations coupled with lower factory overhead costs 
we managed our fixed overhead costs to help offset some of the lost gross profit from reduced sales in a highly competitive market in as a result  gross margin was relatively stable in compared to selling and administrative expenses decreased by million to million in selling and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues for were compared to in in light of the lower revenue in and weakness in the economy  we implemented cost reduction initiatives in may  september and may  which generated an annualized operating cost savings of approximately million 
these cost savings  which are primarily due to a reduction in our workforce  and our cost containment efforts  were the principal reasons for the decrease in selling and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization decreased million to million in year ended december  operating income was million in and million in the impact on operating income from the lower sales was significantly lessened by our operating expense reductions 
we reduced selling and administrative expenses by million principally due to cost reduction programs implemented in and additionally  as noted above  depreciation and amortization expense was lower by  resulting from our initiatives to control capital expenditures 
these expense reductions and cost containment initiatives  as well as lower factory overhead spending  helped to mitigate the reduction in operating income due to lower sales 
other income for the years ended december  and  was million 
the other income for the year ended december  is the result of the gain recognized from the sale and leaseback of our conshohocken  pennsylvania property 
a deferred gain of million is being recognized over the ensuing three year leaseback period 
the other income during the year ended december  is the result of a fair market value adjustment to a liability recorded in connection with detachable stock warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of per share 
these warrants were issued along with the company s stock issuance of  shares of common stock on december  to a group of private investors 
this liability is accounted for at fair market value and adjustments in future quarters could result in an increase to the liability and a corresponding charge to income 
interest expense decreased million to million during compared to the same period of the decrease is due to lower debt outstanding during the year partially offset by higher interest rates 
federal and state income tax benefit was million during compared with a tax benefit of million for the same period in the effective income tax rate for was compared with in the same period of the effective tax rate during was favorably affected by state tax benefits and exports sales and negatively affected by certain permanent differences including non deductible interest expense 
net loss was  in and  in the impact on net loss from lower operating income was partially offset by reduced tax effected interest expense 
as a result  we increased our net loss in by liquidity and capital resources at december  and december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  and  respectively 
generally  we do not carry significant cash and cash equivalent balances because excess amounts are used to pay down our revolving line of credit 
total bank and related debt as of december  was  as compared to  at december   a decrease of  due to net payments under the bank credit facilities 
the cash that we used to pay down our debt came from cash generated by operating activities 
unused credit availability under our revolving line of credit at december  was  the bank credit facility was amended in november by extending the maturities of the revolving line of credit to january and in december to waive minimum coverage requirements under several financial covenants through december  no extinguishment loss was recognized as a result of this amendment 
we opted to amend the existing agreement rather than refinance the entire credit facility because of current market conditions 
we will continue to monitor such market conditions and will seek refinancing alternatives in future periods 
however  our loans are secured by substantially all of our assets and our ability to borrow additional amounts on a secured basis would be limited 
on september    of subordinated debt was raised from a related party with a maturity of april  and interest rate of per annum 
on june   the maturity date was extended by letter agreement to january  this debt is subordinated to the bank credit facility and the subordinated debt originally issued in december on december   the principal balance of the notes owed to green diamond was increased for the unpaid accrued interest 
the principal balance for the  subordinated note was increased by the accrued interest of  to  and the principal balance for the  subordinated note was increased by to  and the maturity date was extended to january  the entire principal balance of this obligation will be due upon maturity 
proceeds were used to reduce the revolving line of credit 
overview of cash flows and liquidity for the year ended december  s in thousands total operating cash flow purchases of property and equipment divestiture of businesses and other proceeds from sale of property net cash provided by used in investing activities proceeds from issuance of common stock and detachable warrants stock issuance expense repayments of borrowings  net proceeds from subordinated notes other net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in  million was generated from operating activities 
cash provided was impacted by our net loss adjusted for non cash items and increasing working capital demands from increasing sales 
we used additional cash due to an increase in accounts receivable of million that was due to increasing sales in the fourth quarter 
the other working capital accounts that used cash were inventory and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from increased purchases on increasing sales volume provided cash of million 
cash was also provided by increases in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and an increase in other liabilities 
our net investment in working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents and current portion of debt at december  was million as compared to million at december  looking forward  we will continue to manage our net investment in working capital 
we believe that our working capital needs will tend to change at a lower rate than the change in sales due to the acceleration of progress billings and collections of such on major contracts 
cash provided by operating activities in was million 
cash provided was impacted by net loss adjusted for non cash items  lessened working capital demands from lower sales and improved turnover in accounts receivable 
major changes in working capital that provided cash included accounts receivable  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  inventory  major changes in working capital that used cash included deferred charges and other assets  accounts payable and accrued expenses  and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts  net cash used in investing activities related to the acquisition of capital expenditures for property and equipment was  for compared with  for the same period in we received cash proceeds of approximately million from the sale of our conshohocken property as discussed in the following paragraph 
we are managing our capital expenditures in light of the current level of sales 
should sales increase in  we anticipate increased capital expenditure spending 
additional capital expenditures may be incurred related to the replacement facilities subject to the successful completion of the sale of our cincinnati property 
on may   we received approximately million in cash proceeds from the sale and leaseback of our conshohocken  pennsylvania property 
approximately  was used to reduce the revolving line of credit and the balance was used to reduce term debt 
financing activities used cash of million during compared with cash used of million during the same period of current year financing activities included net borrowings of  on our revolving line of credit and payments of million on our term loan 
our backlog has increased from million in to million in  and the company believes that the amount available on its credit facility  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet its short term needs for liquidity over the next twelve months 
additionally  in the longer term  we have real estate with market values significantly in excess of debt which may be sold to generate cash flow 
our cost reduction initiatives will have both short term and long term cash flow implications 
a lower or more stable cost structure will be beneficial in future periods as revenues increase 
we also have access to additional financing by increasing the amount of our subordinated debt obtained through related parties 
dividends we did not pay any dividends during the years ended december  and and do not expect to pay any in the foreseeable future as we are party to various loan documents that prevent us from paying such dividends 
debt covenants the company s credit facilities contained financial covenants requiring compliance including at december  and each quarter through september  maximum leverage of to  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to and minimum interest coverage ratio of to our debt agreement has been amended several times in recent years to revise covenants in order for the company to be in compliance with such covenants at quarterly reporting periods 
these amendments were necessary as a result of the economic environment over the last four years  which negatively affected the markets and industries served by us and therefore our operations and financial performance 
our below plan financial performance resulted in our inability to meet certain covenants that were established based on a higher level of operations 
we have made significant changes in our business in response to the lower level of revenues and believe our ability to react effectively has enabled us to successfully renegotiate our agreement 
the company s credit facilities were amended on december  to reduce the financial covenant requirements for december  in the future  if we cannot comply with the terms of the credit agreement as currently written  it will be necessary for us obtain a waiver or renegotiate our loan covenants  and there can be no assurance that such negotiations will be successful 
however  we have been able to demonstrate to our lender our ability to address the situation s resulting in our inability to comply by making changes to our business and successfully renegotiating our agreement 
in the event that we are not successful in obtaining a waiver or an amendment  we would be declared in default which would cause all amounts owed to be immediately due and payable 
employee benefit obligations based on the assumptions used to value other postretirement obligations  life insurance benefits and retiree healthcare benefits  in the fourth quarter of  cash payments for these benefits are expected to be in the range of  in each of the next years 
based on current assumptions  estimated contributions of  may be required in for the pension plan and  for the retiree healthcare plan 
the amount and timing of required contributions to the pension trust depends on future investment performance of the pension funds and interest rate movements  among other things and  accordingly  we cannot reasonably estimate actual required payments 
currently  our pension plan is under funded 
as a result  absent major increases in long term interest rates  above average returns on pension assets and or changes in legislated funding requirements  we will be required to make contributions to our pension trust of varying amounts in the long term 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table lists our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands of dollars 
total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations a estimated interest payments estimated pension funding subordinated debt b estimated interest payments on subordinated debt operating lease obligations c purchase obligations d a as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
b as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
c primarily as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
d primarily consists of purchase obligations for various costs associated with uncompleted sales contracts 
our interest rate swap matured in november and therefore  no future obligation exists under this agreement 
estimated interest payments associated with long term debt are based on anticipated interest payments on the term debt and estimated interest payments on the line of credit are based on the projected borrowing levels throughout the term of the line of credit 
interest payments associated with the repayment of the subordinated debt are based on the fixed rates  outstanding principal and anticipated payment dates 
interest on the subordinated debt is not currently permitted under the credit facility and therefore  accrued interest is assumed to be paid upon maturity of the debt for purposes of this schedule 
at december   accrued interest of million on related party subordinated debt was capitalized as principal and the related notes were amended to reflect this increase 
pension funding was assumed to stay at current levels based on consistent discount and long term return rates  current funding levels and no significant changes in plan design or benefits 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies  the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity 
revenue recognition a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from contracts  which are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date compared to estimated total contract costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
this method requires a higher degree of management judgment and use of estimates than other revenue recognition methods 
the judgments and estimates involved include management s ability to accurately estimate the contracts percentage of completion and the reasonableness of the estimated costs to complete  among other factors  at each financial reporting period 
in addition  certain contracts are highly dependent on the work of contractors and other subcontractors participating in a project  over which we have no or limited control  and their performance on such project could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts 
delays resulting from these contractors and subcontractors  changes in the scope of the project  weather  and labor availability also can have an effect on a contracts profitability 
contract costs include direct material  labor costs  and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  and other overhead expenses 
selling and administrative expenses are charged to expense as incurred 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
changes to job performance  job conditions  and estimated profitability may result in revisions to contract revenue and costs and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are made 
we provided for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts of  and  at december   and  respectively 
inventory costing all inventories are currently valued at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out fifo method 
prior to december   inventories were valued at the lower of cost or market using the last in  first out lifo inventory method for the labor content of work in process and finished products and substantially all inventories of steel at our cincinnati facility approximately of total inventories at december  
the remaining contents in our inventory were valued using the fifo method 
management changed its method of accounting for its lifo inventory to the fifo method as management believes the fifo method is preferable because it provides a better matching of costs to revenues  provides a more meaningful presentation of the company s financial position by reflecting recent costs in the balance sheet  and provides for a uniform costing method across the company s operations 
the lifo method of inventory valuation for all classes of inventory approximated the fifo value at december  and and therefore  prior periods have not been restated for this accounting change 
the effect of the change for the three months ended december  and the year ended december  was an increase to inventory of  the effect on net loss for the three months ended december  and the year ended december  was a reduction of  net loss per share was reduced for the three months ended december  and the year ended december  by 
impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill we review the carrying value of our long lived assets held for use and assets to be disposed of periodically when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of such assets 
for all assets excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset 
if this occurs  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds its fair value 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this accounting standard  we no longer amortize our goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life and are required to complete an annual impairment test 
we have determined that we have a single reporting unit  as defined in sfas no 
 within our company 
we completed our impairment test during as required by this accounting standard and have not recognized an impairment charge related to the adoption of this accounting standard 
the impairment test requires us to forecast our future cash flows  which requires significant judgment 
as of december   we have million of goodwill  
million of intangible assets finite life  million of indefinite life intangible assets  and million of property  plant  and equipment recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes and tax valuation allowances we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and will provide necessary valuation allowances as required 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
if we continue to operate at a loss or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to record a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results 
gross deferred tax assets and gross deferred tax liabilities at december  totaled million and million  respectively 
risk management activities we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate and foreign currency exposures 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we may enter into hedging relationships such that changes in the fair values or cash flows of items and transactions being hedged are expected to be offset by corresponding changes in the values of the derivatives 
accounting for derivative instruments is complex  as evidenced by the significant interpretations of the primary accounting standard  and continues to evolve 
as of december   there were no derivative instruments outstanding 
pension and postretirement benefit plan assumptions we sponsor a pension plan for certain union employees 
we also sponsor a postretirement healthcare benefit plan for certain office employees retiring before january  several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans 
these factors include key assumptions  such as a discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
in addition  our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these liabilities 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension or postretirement healthcare benefit expenses we have recorded or may record in the future 
an analysis for the expense associated with our pension plan is difficult due to the variety of assumptions utilized 
for example  one of the significant assumptions used to determine projected benefit obligation is the discount rate 
at december   a basis point change in the discount rate would change the projected benefit obligation by approximately  and the annual post retirement expense by less than  additionally  a basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would change the annual post retirement expense by approximately  cash surrender value of life insurance we have whole life insurance policies in force on the lives of six former shareholders of certain subsidiaries 
these policies were purchased by these subsidiaries prior to their acquisition by ceco environmental  inc in and were originally intended to provide funding for repurchasing shares in the event of the death of a shareholder 
the policies are fully paid up and the cash surrender values have been borrowed to pay premiums and interest on the policy loans  and to provide an occasional low cost source of financing for the company 
interest on the policy loans is expensed and the loan amounts on the cash surrender values are increased to cover payment of this expense 
the net value of these policies  reported as other long term assets  was   and  as of december   and other significant accounting policies other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of our financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  which discusses accounting policies that must be selected by us when there are acceptable alternatives 
backlog our backlog consists of orders we have received for products and services we expect to ship and deliver within the next months 
our backlog  as of december  was million compared to million as of december  there can be no assurances that backlog will be replicated  increased or translated into higher revenues in the future 
the success of our business depends on a multitude of factors related to our backlog and the orders secured during the subsequent period s 
certain contracts are highly dependent on the work of contractors and other subcontractors participating in a project  over which we have no or limited control  and their performance on such project could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts 
delays resulting from these contractors and subcontractors  changes in the scope of the project  weather  and labor availability also can have an effect on a contract s profitability 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued a revised fasb interpretation no 
 entitled consolidation of variable interest entities 
as revised  the new interpretation requires that the company consolidate all variable interest entities in its financial statements under certain circumstances 
we adopted the revised interpretation as of march  as required  however  the adoption of this interpretation did not affect our financial condition or results of operations  as we do not have any variable interest entities 
in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf no 
provided guidance for revenue arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products or services where performance may occur at different points or over different periods of time 
eitf no 
is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this interpretation on january  did not affect our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
revised is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
statement no 
r will require the fair value of all stock option awards issued to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period 
the statement also requires the recognition of compensation expense for the fair value of any unvested stock option awards outstanding at the date of adoption 
we are currently evaluating the impact on our results from adopting sfas no 
r  but expect it to be comparable to the pro forma effects of applying the original sfas no

raw materials the profitability of our manufactured products is affected by changing purchase prices of steel and other materials 
if higher steel or other material prices cannot be passed onto to our customers  operating income will be adversely affected 
credit risk as part of our ongoing control procedures  we monitor concentrations of credit risk associated with financial institutions with which we conduct business 
credit risk is minimal as credit exposure is limited with any single high quality financial institution to avoid concentration 
we also monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business 
concentrations of credit associated with these trade receivables are considered minimal due to our geographically diverse customer base 
bad debts have not been significant 
we do not normally require collateral or other security to support credit sales
