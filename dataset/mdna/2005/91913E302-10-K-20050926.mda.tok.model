company overview valentis is a clinical stage biotechnology company engaged in the development of innovative products for peripheral arterial disease  or pad  a large and unsatisfied market 
pad is due to chronic inflammation of the blood vessels of the legs leading to the formation of plaque which obstructs blood flow 
vlts  our lead product  is an anti inflammatory drug in phase iib testing 
our second product for the treatment of pad is the del angiogenic protein  a product  which we believe promotes the formation of new blood vessels 
valentis has developed a series of technologies including gene delivery and expression technologies  and proprietary formulation and manufacturing technologies that allow the generation of novel therapeutics to treat a wide range of diseases 
while valentis is focusing its efforts on the development of novel peripheral arterial disease therapeutics  its technologies are being applied by its collaborators for the development of therapeutics to treat a variety of indications including infectious diseases and cancer 
vlts  our lead product  is a nonionic block copolymer 
vlts appears to have a direct effect of repairing compromised cell membranes and improving cell function  which may have a therapeutic benefit in ischemic tissue due to its anti inflammatory effects 
peripheral arterial disease is a result of atherosclerosis in the legs of patients 
atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder of blood vessels that ultimately leads to the formation of atheroma or plaque in large blood vessels 
this plaque impedes blood flow to tissues including the legs 
vlts is believed to reduce levels of specific mediators of inflammation  which drives progression of the disease 
by suppressing the local inflammatory response in the blood vessels and muscle tissue  it would explain the improvement in blood flow and exercise tolerance seen in the prior clinical trial that included vlts we recently completed a phase iia clinical trial comparing vlts to deltavasc  an angiogenic agent  in patients with peripheral arterial disease 
the primary endpoint of the phase iia clinical trial was the improvement in exercise tolerance of patients treated with deltavasc 
in september  we reported that our deltavasc product did not meet its primary endpoint in the clinical trial 
both the deltavasc and the vlts treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant improvements compared to baseline with no significant differences between treatment groups 
in that trial  vlts demonstrated statistically significant improvements in exercise tolerance percent  p  ankle brachial index p and quality of life over baseline 
patients treated with vlts experienced an increase in work capacity of percent compared to baseline measurements 
in order to assess the potential efficacy of vlts in peripheral arterial disease  we have initiated a phase iib trial comparing vlts versus saline in patients with pad 
the results of this clinical trial are expected in mid calendar a positive outcome for the clinical trial demonstrating a statistically significant drug effect and safety for use in the targeted population is critical to the continued development of vlts a negative trial outcome could have a material and adverse effect on the further development of vlts  negatively affect our ability to raise additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all  negatively impact our business and prospects and cause the price of our common stock to fall 
see additional factors that may affect future results for a description of the risks related to our product development efforts  including risks with regard to the vlts pad phase iib clinical trial 
if results of the phase iib clinical trial justify proceeding to a phase iii clinical trial of vlts  we expect to license vlts to a pharmaceutical company that will assume responsibility for late stage development and commercialization 
additionally  we expect to perform an interim analysis of a portion of the placebo patients at the end of calendar change in peak walking time after days will be calculated on a representative sample of placebo patients to assess the validity of the statistical assumptions in the phase iib trial 
following the analysis  the sample size for the trial may be recalculated based on these placebo data and the number of subjects to be enrolled may be reduced or increased by the sponsor 
the calculations will be performed by a separate statistical team  and no study personnel will have access to unblinded data 
since no results of the active treatment arm will be available and no treatment comparisons will be made  there will be no impact on the type i error rate and no adjustments to the alpha level for the final analysis will be necessary 
results of operations fiscal years ended june   and revenue revenue recognized in the fiscal years ended june   and is as follows in thousands year ended june  license and milestone revenue geneswitch licenses dnavax gene delivery technology license and milestone pinc gene delivery technology licenses manufacturing technology milestone pegylation technology licenses contract research revenue other revenue total changes in revenue for each of the fiscal years ended june   and are explained below the geneswitch revenue recognized in fiscal  and resulted primarily from license and annual license maintenance fees received under several agreements for our geneswitch technology 
the geneswitch revenue recognized in fiscal included approximately  of license fees received from schering ag under a licensing agreement for the use of our geneswitch technology to develop and commercialize a designated product 
the geneswitch revenue recognized in fiscal included approximately  of license fee received under the same agreement with schering ag that allows the use of our geneswitch technology to develop and commercialize a different designated product 
the geneswitch revenue recognized in fiscal also reflected approximately million of license fee received from glaxosmithkline under an agreement that allows glaxosmithkline to practice the geneswitch technology for research purposes only 
the dnavax gene delivery technology license and milestone revenue of  recognized in fiscal consists of a milestone payment of  and a license fee of  received during fiscal under a license agreement related to our dnavax delivery technology 
the pinc gene delivery technology revenue recognized in fiscal primarily reflected  of license fees received from schering ag under a licensing agreement for the use of our pinc delivery technology to develop and commercialize a designated product 
the pinc gene delivery technology revenue recognized in fiscal included approximately  of license fee received under the same agreement with schering ag that allows the use of our pinc delivery technology to develop and commercialize a different designated product 
we recognized million of manufacturing technology milestone revenue in fiscal under a license agreement for our plasmid dna manufacturing technology 
in july  polymasc pharmaceuticals plc  our wholly owed subsidiary  entered into a license and settlement agreement with alza corporation  a unit of johnson johnson 
under the agreement  polymasc settled its patent infringement litigation against alza and granted a worldwide  irrevocable and non exclusive license to alza under its peg liposome patents 
non recurring license revenue of million was recognized from this agreement in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized  of contract research revenue under agreements with other companies 
under the agreements  we are required to conduct research on the manufacturing of certain biological materials for other companies 
the revenue was recognized based on research performed during the year 
other revenue of  and  recognized in fiscal and  respectively  consisted primarily of profit sharing and royalties received under a plasmid dna manufacturing agreement 
revenue derived from corporate collaborations and licenses helps us fund our operations and may increase in the future if we are successful in establishing new collaborations and additional licensing of our technology 
if we are unsuccessful in establishing new collaborations  additional licensing and grants  revenues may decline 
therefore  a reduction in funds for conducting our research and development  clinical trial  manufacturing  marketing and sales efforts may occur 
costs and expenses costs of contract research were  for fiscal year ended june   which consisted of costs incurred for contract research on the manufacturing of biological materials for other companies and included direct and related overhead expenses and costs of general and administrative support 
we did not have contract research arrangements with other companies prior to the fiscal year ended june  research and development expenses were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease in expenses in fiscal compared to primarily reflects decreased expenses for the deltavasc pad phase iia clinical trial  which completed the dosing of patients in june and resulted in a fall off in clinical trial expenses 
the decrease was partially offset by expenses incurred for the commencement of the vlts phase iib clinical trial in march the increase in expenses in fiscal compared to was primarily attributable to increased clinical trial expenses for the deltavasc pad phase iia clinical trial  which was initiated in july the increase was partially offset by decreased expenses resulting from staff reductions in october we expect research and development expenses in the future to remain at current levels 
however  research and development expenses may increase or decrease depending on the outcome of the vlts phase iib clinical trial and if we are successful in securing additional new funding and strategic partnerships to support increased spending levels 
the results of the trial are expected mid calendar the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential products 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and including  among others  proof of concept in animal studies and phase i  ii  and iii clinical studies in humans each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
our research and development expenses currently include costs for scientific personnel  animal studies  supplies  equipment  consultants  patent filings  overhead allocation  human clinical trials and sponsored research at academic and research institutions 
all of our research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended june   and were incurred in connection with the development of novel peripheral arterial disease therapeutics 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease in expenses in fiscal compared to was primarily attributable to lower depreciation and clinical support expenses in fiscal  partially offset by expenses recorded in fiscal for the issuance of warrants to non employees for services provided 
the decrease in expenses in fiscal compared to primarily reflected higher professional fees and other expenses incurred in fiscal related to the company s capital restructuring efforts  patent infringement lawsuit with alza corporation and the termination of leases  partially offset by savings resulting from staff reductions in october we expect our annual general and administrative expenses to increase in the future reflecting expenses associated with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act including  as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act  our assessment of and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
however  general and administrative expenses may increase or decrease depending on the outcome of the vlts phase iib clinical trial and if we are successful in securing additional new funding and strategic partnerships to support increased spending levels 
the results of the trial are expected mid calendar corporate restructuring on october   we announced that we had reduced our staff and planned expenditures to allow us to continue the development of our then lead product  del for the treatment of a variety of cardiovascular diseases including peripheral arterial disease pad and ischemic heart disease ihd 
in addition  we continued to advance our geneswitch gene regulation technology through the licensing to other companies 
in connection with our corporate restructuring  we reduced staff by individuals in order to reduce our cash expenditures 
for the year ended june   we recorded restructuring and related charges of approximately  interest income and other income and expense  net interest income and other income and expense  net was approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income and other income and expense  net in fiscal compared to was primarily attributable to higher interest income derived from higher investment balances in fiscal the decrease in interest income and other income and expense  net in fiscal compared to resulted primarily from decreased interest income derived from lower investment balances in fiscal and foreign currency transaction adjustments recorded in fiscal we did not incur any interest expenses for fiscal and interest expense for fiscal was approximately deemed dividend and adjustment related to series a redeemable convertible preferred stock the deemed dividend related to series a redeemable convertible preferred stock see note redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity in our notes to consolidated financial statements includes the accretion of warrants  the accretion of a beneficial conversion feature and the accretion of related issuance costs 
upon conversion of the series a preferred stock to common stock in january  the remaining amount of unaccreted deemed dividend representing the balance of amounts attributed to common stock purchase warrants  beneficial conversion feature and issuance costs related to the series a preferred stock was fully accreted and recorded as a deemed dividend 
additionally  as a result of the simultaneous conversion of the series a preferred stock to common stock and the reduction in the series a preferred stock conversion price see note redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity in our notes to consolidated financial statements  the excess of the fair value of the common stock issued to the series a preferred stockholders over the fair value of the common stock issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms was approximately million 
dividends on series a redeemable convertible preferred stock dividends on the series a preferred stock see note redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity in our notes to consolidated financial statements were calculated at the rate of per annum  and were approximately  for the fiscal years ended june  and were charged against additional paid in capital 
there were no dividends paid on the series a preferred stock during fiscal and because all of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock were converted into common stock in january new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  or statement r  share based payment 
fas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and will require companies to recognize compensation expense  using a fair value based method  for costs related to share based payments including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
we adopted fas r on july  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using either the modified prospective or modified retrospective transition method 
we have decided to use the modified prospective transition method  which requires that compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted  modified or settled after the effective date as well as for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested as of the effective date 
we expect that our adoption of fas r will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
however  uncertainties such as stock price volatility  estimated forfeitures and employee stock option exercise behavior  make it difficult to determine whether future stock based compensation expenses will be similar to the pro forma expenses disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as discussed elsewhere in this report  including further below  we have received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  that includes an explanatory paragraph stating that the financial statements have been prepared assuming valentis will continue as a going concern 
the explanatory paragraph states the following conditions  which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern i we have incurred operating losses since inception  including a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended june   and our accumulated deficit was million at june  and ii we anticipate requiring additional financial resources to enable us to fund our operations at least through june  management s plans as to these matters are also described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are currently supporting the ongoing vlts phase iib clinical trial 
the results of this trial are expected in mid calendar a positive outcome for the clinical trial demonstrating a statistically significant drug effect and safety for use in the targeted population is critical to the continued development of vlts a negative trial outcome could have a material and adverse effect on the further development of vlts  negatively affect valentis ability to raise additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all  negatively impact our business and prospects and cause the price of our common stock to fall 
see additional factors that may affect future results for a description of the risks related to our product development efforts  including risks with regard to the vlts pad phase iib clinical trial 
if results of the phase iib clinical trial justify proceeding to a phase iii clinical trial of vlts  because of the size of the potential market for the product and the number of possible uses for the product  we expect to license vlts to a pharmaceutical company that will assume responsibility for late stage development and commercialization 
since our inception  we have financed our operations principally through public and private issuances of our common and preferred stock and funding from collaborative arrangements 
we have used the net proceeds from the sale of the common and preferred stock for general corporate purposes  which has included funding research  development and product manufacturing  increasing our working capital  reducing indebtedness  acquisitions or investments in businesses  products or technologies that are complementary to our own  and capital expenditures 
we expect that proceeds received from any future issuance of stock will be used for similar purposes 
in june  we completed a private placement  in which we issued and sold  shares of common stock and warrants  exercisable for a five year period  to purchase  shares of common stock at per unit  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
the warrants are exercisable at per share june private placement 
we entered into registration rights agreements with the purchasers in the june private placement 
pursuant to the registration rights agreements  we filed with the securities and exchange commission registration statements related to the shares issued to the purchasers and shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants under the private placements 
in the event we must suspend use of the registration statements for greater than consecutive days or a total of days in the aggregate during the time we are required to keep the registration statement effective under the registration rights agreements  then we must pay to each purchaser in cash of the purchaser s aggregate purchase price of the shares for the first month  as well as an additional of the purchaser s aggregate purchase price for each additional month thereafter  while the use of the registration statements has been suspended 
we currently expect to be required to maintain availability of the registration statement for at least two years following the applicable closing 
in addition  under the securities purchase agreement entered into in connection with the june private placement  while there is an effective registration statement and if we fail to deliver a stock certificate that is free of restrictive legends within three trading days upon delivery of such a request by a purchaser of the june private placement  we are required to pay to the purchaser  for each  of shares of stock or shares issuable upon exercise of warrants requested  per trading day for each trading day beginning five trading days after the delivery of the request  increasing to per trading day after the first five trading days for which such damages have begun to accrue  until such certificate is delivered without restrictive legends 
the safety and long term effects of gene based therapy has been evaluated and debated extensively in recent years 
in  the food and drug administration issued a guidance document that mandated long term follow up of patients treated in gene therapy clinical trials 
currently all gene therapy clinical trials are required to include a long term follow up program to collect patient safety data for selected morbidities in patients over the course of years 
valentis initiated the long term follow up program for the deltavasc phase iia clinical trial in january we estimated the total expenses for this program to be approximately  over the period of fifteen years and the expenses for the first year of the program to be approximately  of which approximately  of expenses have been incurred and recorded in the year ended june  it is anticipated that annual expenses for this program will decline substantially over the year period due to the length of follow up and the age of the patients 
in september  the fda stated that it generally will not require long term follow up observations of participants in clinical trials of gene transfer technology when the risk of delayed adverse events is low  according to draft guidance 
valentis intends to work with the fda to determine its long term follow up requirements 
we lease our facilities under operating leases 
these leases expire between november and october with renewal options at the end of the initial terms to extend the leases for an additional six and five years  respectively 
minimal annual rental commitments under the operating leases at june  are as follows in thousands year ended june  our capital expenditures were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect our capital expenditures to remain at current levels 
however  capital expenditures may increase or decrease depending on the outcome of the vlts phase iib clinical trial and if the company is successful in securing additional new funding and strategic partnerships to support increased spending levels 
the results of the trial are expected in mid calendar net cash used in operating activities for the year ended june  was approximately million  which primarily reflected the net loss of million and the decreases in accrued liabilities of million related to compensation and clinical trial expenses 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended june  was approximately million  which primarily consisted of a net loss of approximately million  an increase in accrued clinical trial expenses of approximately million and non cash depreciation expenses of approximately million 
for the year ended june   net cash used in operating activities was approximately million  which was primarily attributable to a net loss of approximately million  the decreases of million of accrued clinical trial expenses and non cash depreciation expenses of million 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  which primarily reflected the maturities of available for sale investments 
for the year ended june   net cash used in investing activities was approximately million  which was primarily attributable to the purchases of marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  which consisted primarily of net proceeds received from the private placements of common stock 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately  for the fiscal year ended june   which related primarily to payments for preferred stock dividends and long term debt 
except for the quarter ended september   in which we reported net income of approximately million resulting principally from the million non recurring license revenue recognized under the license and settlement agreement with alza corporation see note alza license and settlement agreement in our notes to consolidated financial statements  we have experienced net losses since our inception through june   and reported a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended june  our accumulated deficit was million at june  we expect such losses to continue into the foreseeable future as we proceed with the research  development and commercialization of our technologies 
depending on the outcome of the vlts phase iib clinical trial  which is expected in mid calendar  and if we are successful in securing additional new funding and strategic partnerships to support increased expenses  spending levels for research and development and general and administrative expenses may increase above current levels  to reflect increases in clinical trial efforts to advance the vlts pad product to phase iii testing 
at june   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments  and we anticipate that we will require additional financial resources to advance the vlts product and continue our planned operations at least through june  the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the matters discussed above 
critical accounting policies clinical trial expenses valentis believes the accrual for clinical trial expense represents its most significant estimate used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
valentis accruals for clinical trial expenses are based in part on estimates of services received and efforts expended pursuant to agreements established with clinical research organizations and clinical trial sites 
we have a history of contracting with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities on our behalf in the ongoing development of our biopharmaceutical drugs 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations and may vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
we determine our estimates through discussion with internal clinical personnel and outside service providers as to progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services 
the objective of valentis clinical trial accrual policy is to reflect the appropriate trial expenses in our financial statements by matching period expenses with period services and efforts expended 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we accrue expenses associated with an estimate of the remaining  non cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the trial 
our estimates and assumptions for clinical trial expenses have been reasonably accurate in the past 
revenue recognition revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are considered separately for each of the separate units 
non refundable up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology advancement funding that is intended for the development of our core technology  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant period specified in the agreement  generally the research term 
revenue related to research with our corporate collaborators is recognized as research services are performed over the related funding periods for each contract 
under these agreements  we are required to perform research and development activities as specified in each respective agreement 
the payments received under each respective agreement are not refundable and are generally based on a contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project 
research and development expenses under the collaborative research agreements approximate or exceed the revenue recognized under such agreements over the terms of the respective agreements 
deferred revenue may result when we do not incur the required level of effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective contracts 
payments received relative to substantive  at risk incentive milestones  if any  are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the incentive milestone event because we have no future performance obligations related to the payment 
incentive milestone payments are triggered either by results of our research efforts or by events external to us  such as regulatory approval to market a product 
we also have licensed technology to various biotechnology  pharmaceutical and contract manufacturing companies 
under these arrangements  we receive nonrefundable license payments in cash 
these payments are recognized as revenue when received  provided we have no future performance or delivery obligations under these agreements 
otherwise  revenue is deferred until performance or delivery is satisfied 
certain of these license agreements also provide the licensee an option to acquire additional licenses or technology rights for a fixed period of time 
fees received for such options are deferred and recognized at the time the option is exercised or expires unexercised 
additionally  certain of these license agreements involve technology that we have licensed or otherwise acquired through arrangements with third parties pursuant to which we are required to pay a royalty equal to a fixed percentage of amounts received by us as a result of licensing this technology to others 
such royalty obligations are recorded as a reduction of the related revenue 
furthermore  we receive royalty and profit sharing payments under a licensing agreement with a contract manufacturing company 
royalty and profit sharing payments are recognized as revenue when received 
we also provide contract research services for research and development manufacturing of biological materials for other companies 
under these contracts  we generally receive payments based on a contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project 
revenue is recognized for actual research work performed during the period
