item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation summary of products and segments we are a leading supplier of products that enable the research  development and manufacturing of nanoscale features by helping our customers understand their three dimensional structures 
we serve the semiconductor  data storage and industry and institute markets  where decreasing feature sizes and the need for sub surface  structural information drive the need for our equipment and services 
our products and systems include hardware and software for focused ion beams  or fibs  scanning electron microscopes  or sems  transmission electron microscopes  or tems  and dualbeam systems  which combine a fib and sem on a single platform  as well as secondary ion mass spectrometry systems  or sims  stylus nanoprofilometry imaging systems  or snps  and cad navigation and yield management software 
tems  sems and sims systems collectively comprise our electron optics segment products 
dualbeams  fibs  snps and cad navigation and yield management software products collectively comprise our microelectronics segment products 
overview the semiconductor and industry and institute markets showed strength throughout  while the data storage market slowed significantly in the second half of our small dualbeam products  our defect analysis tools and our tems showed the strongest growth in we received a number of strategic orders during the second half of  including a multi unit order for defect analysis tools  small dualbeams and tems from a leading memory manufacturer for use in developing next generation devices 
in the first half of  we announced that we had broken the one angstrom barrier with a kv tem  which has positively affected sales of our tecnai tools and our defect analysis tools 
our customers are combining our ultra high resolution tems with our defect analysis tools and our small dualbeam products to create systems that allow them to determine the root cause of ultra small defects in the semiconductor fab  taking advantage of our strength in wafer level defect analysis tools  small dualbeams for sample milling and analysis and tems for high resolution analysis 
in the industry and institute markets  the market was strong in part because of continued growth in government spending worldwide for nanotechnology research 
that government funding supports many of the orders we receive from academic and institutional customers 
we believe we are benefiting from this spending because of the new capabilities we are bringing to this market  especially with ultra high resolution imaging in tems and three dimensional cutting and imaging in the lower priced small dualbeams introduced in our increased production volume during the second half of had a positive impact on our gross margins  as we utilized our production capacity more efficiently  although utilization in us operations was lower than expected 
the weakening united states dollar in had a negative impact on our operating expenses 
this impact was partially offset by our hedging program 
despite the positive effects of our hedging program  we anticipate that our operating results in coming quarters will continue to be affected somewhat by volatility in exchange rates 
however  with our hedging program  we are better able to match realized gains and losses pertaining to these derivative contracts with the actual economic gains and losses of the underlying hedge transaction in the appropriate line items of our statement of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s below 
outlook for for  we expect our revenues to continue to be substantially dependent upon the health of the semiconductor and industry and institute markets 
in particular  an upturn in the semiconductor market and capital spending by semiconductor companies would be beneficial to us 
also  we are increasingly focused on selling products to emerging nanotechnology research markets 
the extent to which these markets develop and increase their capital spending will impact our revenues for the year 
we expect to introduce new product and product enhancements in the year and the timing of these new product introductions  as well as the degree to which customers accept them and prefer them to our competitors products  also will affect our revenues for the year 
we also are seeking to modestly increase our product gross margins in our success in achieving this will depend on our ability to increase sales volumes and gain higher factory utilization  improve our product mix through increased sales of our higher margin products and reduce materials costs and other costs in our supply chain 
we expect our foreign currency hedging activities to partially mitigate the effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on our gross margins in  although these fluctuations will continue to have some impact on our financial results 
in  we also plan to increase our r d and marketing spending in absolute dollars as we continue to develop and introduce new products 
our reported earnings in also will be affected by certain changes in accounting rules 
among other things  beginning in mid we will be required to expense certain amounts associated with the grant of employee equity incentives  such as stock options and the sale of shares to our employees under our employee share purchase plan 
also  since the fourth quarter of we have been required to treat the approximately million shares of our common stock deemed to be underlying our zero coupon convertible debt as outstanding for purposes of calculating our diluted earnings per share amounts  in addition we will have to include the approximately million shares underlying our convertible debt in our per share calculation to the extent the inclusion of those shares is dilutive

net sales increased million  or  to million  in compared to million in the increase in net sales was driven primarily by increased sales to the microelectronics segment  due to stronger semiconductor industry conditions in compared to  as well as increased electron optics segment sales from nanotechnology research  which are described more fully below 
net sales increased million  or  to million in compared to million in this increase primarily resulted from increases in sales from our microelectronics and service segments 
sales in the asian pacific and european regions were also stronger in compared to net sales by segment net sales include sales in our microelectronics  electron optics  components and service segments 
net sales by segment in thousands and as a percentage of total sales were as follows year ended december  microelectronics    electron optics    service    components    microelectronics the million  or  increase in microelectronics sales in compared to primarily was due to increased capital spending by the semiconductor industry  which positively affected unit sales of our mm defect analysis tools and of our newer small dualbeam products 
our small dualbeam systems include the nova product and the quanta d 
our new small dualbeam products  which have a lower price point than our other dual beam products  have made it possible for certain customers to buy a dualbeam product rather than one of our single beam sem products 
we also had improvements in sales of our circuit edit and mask repair tools in compared to in addition  we had million of software sales related to our knights technology software purchased as the egsoft division of electroglas in the third quarter of in  compared to million in the million  or  increase in microelectronics sales in compared to primarily was a result of increased demand for new products  combined with some improvement in demand for existing products directed at the semiconductor and data storage equipment business 
total unit shipments increased in compared to the increase was due primarily to strong demand for our small stage dualbeam systems and our data storage metrology certus d systems  which were introduced in mid electron optics the million  or  increase in our electron optics segment in compared to primarily was due to unit increases in sales of our sem products and increased sales of our higher end tem products  which were partially driven by increased spending in the research market and improved product positioning 
the million  or  decrease in electron optics sales in compared to primarily was a result of decreased volumes of both tem and sem units and continued pricing pressures from competition in the marketplace  partially offset by favorable currency exchange gains totaling approximately million 
total electron optics unit shipments decreased by in compared to shifts in product mix towards our lower priced products and lower margin products  such as sems  negatively affected our sales in compared to  as did the shift from possible sem sales to our small dualbeam microelectronics products 
service the million  or  increase in our service segment in compared to  as well as the million  or  increase in compared to  primarily were due to continued expansion of our installed base 
our installed base grew in compared to service sales are driven by the size of our installed base and the percentage of our installed base that is more than one year old  as our warranty period is typically one year 
increased sales of systems that have reached the end of their warranty periods usually lead to a related increase in service contracts 
components our component sales  which comprised between and of our net sales from to  tend to follow the cyclical pattern of the semiconductor equipment business 
sales from our component segment were flat in compared to as improvements in the semiconductor equipment business  primarily in the first three quarters of  were offset by longer product life 
components are consumables and  therefore  the longer the product life  the less they have to be replaced 
in addition  our component production capacity is limited  and we utilized a larger percentage of the components internally in compared to our component sales were relatively flat in as compared to  but did increase sequentially in each quarter of sales by geographic region a significant portion of our revenue has been derived from customers outside of the united states  which we expect to continue 
the following table shows our net sales by geographic location dollars in thousands year ended december  north america    europe    asia pacific region    north america the million  or  increase in sales in north america in compared to primarily was due to the improvement in the semiconductor industry  which positively affected unit sales of our mm defect analysis tools and of our small dualbeam products 
also  with the increase in our installed base  service revenues increased in compared to we also had increases in sales of our mask repair and circuit edit tools in compared to in addition  we had million of knights technology software sales in  compared to million in and  virtually all sales from our components segment are in the united states 
the million  or  decrease in sales from the north american region in compared to was due to market uncertainty as well as transition for new product introductions 
the semiconductor and data storage markets were shifting to more overseas production and investment  which shifted sales out of north america and into europe and the asia pacific region 
many united states based companies were purchasing equipment for delivery overseas 
however  the north american economic climate  and the semiconductor industry in particular  improved in the second half of the north american region was also positively affected in by million of sales related to our knights technology software 
europe the million  or  increase in sales in europe in compared to primarily was due to an increase in nanotechnology spending  better customer reception of our higher end tem products  increased service revenue  due to the increase in our installed base  and currency fluctuations 
these increases were partially offset by a large circuit edit sale in that did not repeat in the increase of the value of european currencies against the united states dollar increased sales by approximately million in the million  or  increase in the european region in compared to primarily was due to significant sales to adopters of our small dualbeam product nova 
an overall strengthening of european currencies against the united states dollar had an approximately million positive impact on net sales in was also positively affected by two large microelectronics equipment sales of approximately million each for defect analysis and mask repair 
asia pacific region the million  or  increase in sales in the asia pacific region in compared to primarily was due to increases in unit sales of our small dualbeam products and our sem products 
during the second half of  sales to the korean market increased significantly 
these increases were partially offset by a large data storage sale in that did not repeat in the million  or  increase in the asia pacific region in compared to was primarily due to an increase in sales in japan of microelectronics products  especially small dualbeam units 
we also realized improved sales in china  which included sales of sem and tem electron optics products and certain microelectronic products for the semiconductor industry 
sales by market sales by market and as a percentage of total sales were as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  semiconductor    industry and institute    data storage    semiconductor product sales to the semiconductor market includes both wafer level and small dualbeam systems  defect analysis tools  mask repair and circuit editing fib and dualbeam tools  as well as a number of component products 
the million  or  increase in sales to the semiconductor market in compared to primarily was due to the increase in unit sales of our small dualbeam products  as well as increases in sales of our defect analysis tools 
during the second half of  we sold our first two clm d metrology systems to the semiconductor market 
tem sales also improved significantly in the fourth quarter of  as did sales of our defect analysis and small dualbeam products 
in addition  we had million of revenue in related to our knights technology software  compared to million in the million  or  increase in semiconductor sales in compared to primarily was due to strength in the laboratory area of this sector in the second half of  where we benefited from the general industry upturn  as well as from sales of our small dualbeam products 
during  we also shipped several high end defect analysis systems as part of our strategy to move our defect analysis products from laboratory into production environments 
industry and institute product sales to the industry and institute market primarily consist of sems  tems  small dualbeam and sims systems 
customers in this market include universities  research institutes and corporate research and development labs 
in addition  this market serves life sciences customers who are utilizing pathology applications of our tems and sems 
within the industry and institute market  we see opportunity for increased sales related to applications in life sciences and nanotechnology 
also  with the introduction of our small dualbeam products in mid  we penetrated customers who were previously using sem tools 
these tools  which provide a broader range of solutions for our customers  provide greater gross margins than we obtained on our sem products 
the million  or  increase in sales to the industry and institute market in compared to primarily was due to an increase in unit sales of our sem  tem and small dualbeam products  attributed to increased nanotechnology research spending by governments  universities and industry in both the united states and europe 
sales of our small dualbeam line of products  especially the nova nanolab  as well as our higher end tem products were especially strong 
the million  or  decrease in industry and institute sales in compared to primarily was due to pricing pressure 
data storage product sales to the data storage market primarily consists of wafer and small dualbeam systems 
the million  or  increase in data storage sales in compared to primarily was due to increases in unit sales of our certus product in the first two quarters of  which we began selling in the second half of fiscal the certus tool offers new metrology capability and improved performance over the prior generation of our data storage metrology tool 
while we continue to sell upgrade packages for existing tools  sales of our certus product in the third and fourth quarters of were delayed due to a slow down in capital purchases by the data storage industry 
capital equipment spending in this market is sometimes very volatile from one quarter to the next 
while certain manufacturers in the data storage market have begun to switch to perpendicular recording  until this transition becomes a wide scale trend  we expect our sales to this market to continue to be negatively affected 
the million  or  increase in data storage sales in compared to primarily was due to increased sales of our certus tool in the second half of cost of sales and gross margin cost of sales includes manufacturing costs  such as materials  labor both direct and indirect and factory overhead  as well as all of the costs of our customer service function such as labor  materials  travel and overhead 
in our current circumstance  we see four primary drivers affecting gross margin product mix including the effect of price competition  volume  ongoing cost reduction efforts and currency fluctuations 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase primarily was due to the increases in sales volume and the effects of currency fluctuations related to our manufacturing operations in brno  czech republic  and eindhoven  the netherlands  which is where our electron optics products  our small dualbeam products and certain of our defect analysis tools are manufactured 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase primarily was due to the effects of currency fluctuations related to our manufacturing operations in brno  czech republic  and eindhoven  the netherlands  as well as an increase in sales volume 
our overall gross margin as a percentage of sales in compared to increased slightly  primarily due to the increase in gross margin in the microelectronics segment  as well as the increase in microelectronics sales as a percentage of total sales 
the products in our microelectronics segment generally are higher margin products than the products in our other segments 
our gross margins also benefited from increased utilization in our european manufacturing sites in the second half of this was offset  in part  by lower than expected utilization of our us manufacturing facilities 
our overall gross margin in was reduced by approximately percentage points due to currency effects  net of the benefits of our hedges 
our overall gross margin in compared to decreased primarily due to decreased sales in the microelectronics and electron optics segments 
our gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales by segment was as follows year ended december  microelectronics electron optics components service overall compared to the manufacturing operations for many of our microelectronics and electron optics products are located in europe  and  as the dollar weakened in relation to the euro and czech koruna  our expenses in these locations increased  and our margins have been negatively impacted 
in addition  our electron optics segment experienced pricing pressures from competitors  such as jeol and seiko  which have introduced new products into our markets or which have benefited from favorable currency exchange movements in their countries 
microelectronics the increase in gross margin in the microelectronics segment in compared to primarily was due to an improvement in product mix with an increasing percentage of sales generated by our higher margin small dualbeam products and our defect analysis tools 
in addition  the increase in our software sales as a percentage of total sales in compared to also increased our gross margin 
production efficiencies were also realized as our production volumes increased 
the improvements in margin were partially offset by an approximately percentage point decrease in in our gross margin due to the relative decline in the united states dollar compared to european currencies without giving effect to our foreign currency hedges related to our manufacturing operations in brno  czech republic  and eindhoven  the netherlands 
our small dualbeam products and certain of our defect analysis tools are manufactured in those locations 
electron optics the decrease in margins in our electron optics segment in compared to primarily was due to a percentage point decrease in margins related to the relative decline in the united states dollar compared to european currencies without giving effect to our foreign currency hedges  partially offset by a shift in mix to higher margin sem and tem products and production efficiencies realized as our production volumes increased 
components the decrease in margin in our components segment primarily was due to a decrease in units produced  as well as a shift in mix of component products produced in compared to these decreases were magnified by the fact that our components revenue was only million in service the decrease in margins in our service segment in compared to primarily was due to increases in parts  labor and travel related expenses to support our products introduced in  including the certus products  our small dualbeam products and our clm d metrology systems in both the united states and europe 
we increased headcount in the service segment of our business by approximately  or people  in compared to compared to gross profit and margins were negatively affected in by the weakening of the united states dollar in relation to the euro and other european currencies  without giving effect to currency hedging activity 
currency issues reduced our overall gross profit by approximately million in and increased our gross profit by approximately million in a shift in product mix in  especially within the electron optics segment  to lower margin products  as well as a shift to a greater percentage of our sales being generated by our service segment  also negatively affected gross margin and gross profit 
service segment gross margins  however  have improved in compared to due to continued improved economies of scale from the additional growth in our installed base of systems 
gross margin in the microelectronics segment was positively affected in by the sale of high margin software products acquired when we purchased egsoft in the third quarter of these sales increased our overall gross margin by approximately in research and development costs research and development r d costs include labor  materials  overhead and payments to philips and other third parties for research and development of new products and new software or enhancements to existing products and software and are presented net of subsidies received for such efforts 
r d costs were million of net sales in compared to million of net sales in and million of net sales in r d costs are reported net of subsidies and capitalized software development costs as follows in thousands year ended december  subsidies    capitalized software development costs   r d costs increased approximately million in compared to approximately million of the increase in compared to was as a result of our acquisitions of knights technology in the third quarter of and of emispec in the fourth quarter of increases in labor and related costs  exclusive of our knights technology and emispec acquisitions  added an additional million in expense 
we also had a million increase in material consumption in compared to and a million increase in software application development 
included in the above increases  as well as other components of r d  is a total of million of expense related to the impact that the weakening of the united states dollar in relation to the euro had on r d activities in europe 
r d costs increased approximately million in compared to the weakening of the united states dollar in relation to the euro increased r d costs in compared to by approximately million 
r d costs increased an additional approximately million in as a result of our acquisitions of our knights technology and revise in the third quarter of and of emispec in the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by a decrease in of million in material consumption compared to we anticipate that we will continue to invest in r d at a similar percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  as revenues increase  we currently anticipate that r d expenditures also will increase 
actual future spending  however  will depend on market conditions 
selling  general and administrative costs selling  general and administrative sg a costs include labor  travel  outside services and overhead incurred in our sales  marketing  management and administrative support functions 
sg a costs also include sales commissions paid to our employees as well as to our agents 
sg a costs were million of net sales in compared to million of net sales in and million of net sales in sg a costs increased by million in compared to due to an approximately million increase associated with regulatory requirements  including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and a million increase in labor related costs  including sales commissions and bonuses 
sg a costs also increased approximately million in compared to due to our acquisition of knights technology during the third quarter of included in the above increases  as well as other components of sg a  is a total of million related to the weakening of the united states dollar in relation to the euro 
the weakening of the united states dollar in relation to the euro increased sg a costs in compared to by approximately million 
the increase in also includes costs for moving and temporarily maintaining duplicate facilities related to our transition from leased facilities to our hillsboro facility we moved into in  which totaled approximately million 
sg a costs increased approximately million in due to our acquisitions of our knights technology  revise and emispec and increased million due to increased sales commissions  which resulted from increased sales 
these increases were partially offset by cost containment programs initiated in the fourth quarter of and throughout in addition  we were able to reduce our expenditures in the areas of travel  consulting fees  supplies and other miscellaneous corporate related charges in as compared to merger costs during  million of legal  accounting and investment banking costs were incurred and expensed in connection with our proposed merger with veeco 
in january  the proposed merger was terminated by mutual agreement of the parties 
there were no merger related expenses in or amortization of purchased technology amortization of purchased technology was million in  million in and million in the increases in compared to and in compared to are due to the acquisitions of knights technology and revise during the third quarter of and emispec in the fourth quarter of our purchased technology balance at december  was million  and current amortization of purchased technology is approximately million per quarter  which could increase if we acquire additional technology 
purchased in process research and development the million of purchased in process research and development in relates to the write off of certain in process technology purchased in connection with the acquisition of knights technology and revise in the third quarter of the knights technology acquisition in process research and development relates to next generation computer aided design navigation software 
this software was approximately complete upon acquisition  and became ready for market in late the revise acquisition in process research and development related to laser technology to take core samples from silicon 
this project was approximately complete upon acquisition 
in  this project was determined to have no future value 
no write offs were recorded in restructuring  reorganization and relocation our restructuring charges are based on estimates that are subject to change 
workforce related charges could change because of shifts in timing  redeployment or changes in amounts of severance and outplacement benefits 
facilities charges could change due to changes in sublease income 
our ability to generate sublease income is dependent upon lease market conditions at the time we negotiate the sublease arrangements 
variances from these estimates could alter our ability to achieve anticipated expense reductions in the planned time frame and modify our expected cash outflows and working capital 
as a result of restructuring and other cost reduction efforts  as of december   we had reduced operating expenses and materials costs by approximately million to million per year compared to expense levels at the end of these cost reductions  however  were offset by increased costs due to the decline of the united states dollar against other currencies  increased salary costs primarily in europe  increased insurance expense  increased costs due to redundant operations while we transitioned manufacturing lines to the brno site and consolidated our hillsboro operations in and increased costs due to our acquisitions 
in addition to the charges in connection with our restructuring and reorganization plans  this line item includes costs related to relocating current employees 
relocation costs totaled million in  million in and in the million restructuring charge recorded in was to accrue for costs related to an operating lease for a building we abandoned in the second quarter of fourth quarter restructuring during the fourth quarter of  in response to the continuing global economic downturn  we recorded restructuring and reorganization charges related to our plan to consolidate operations  reduced excess leased facilities and reduced operating expenses 
costs included in the restructuring charges consist of workforce reductions and other related costs  and facility and leasehold improvement charges related to future abandonment of various leased office and manufacturing sites in north america and europe 
restructuring accrual the following table summarizes  for  the charges  write offs and expenditures related to restructuring charges in thousands year ended december  beginning accrued liability charged to expense expenditures write offs adjustments ending accrued liability severance  outplacement and related benefits for terminated employees abandoned leases  leasehold improvements and facilities  remaining cash expenditures for severance and related charges are expected to be paid through the second quarter of the current estimate accrued for cash to be paid related to abandoned leases is net of estimated sublease payments to be received and will be paid over the respective lease terms through other income expense  net other income expense items include interest income  interest expense  foreign currency gains and losses and other miscellaneous items 
interest income represents interest earned on cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities and a shareholder note receivable 
interest income was million in  million in and million in the increase in interest income in compared to was primarily due to increased average cash and investment balances  which were the result of our receipt of net proceeds of million from our zero coupon convertible debt offering in june  offset by the million used for the redemption of a portion of our convertible note and million used for the purchase of a convertible note hedge related to the zero coupon convertible debt offering 
the decrease in interest income in compared to was the result of lower average interest rates  partially offset by increased average cash and investment balances  which was the result of our receipt of net proceeds of million from our zero coupon convertible debt offering in june interest expense for the  and periods primarily relates to our convertible debt issued in august the amortization of capitalized note issuance costs related to both of our convertible note issuances is also included as a component of interest expense 
in addition  interest expense in included the write off of million of note issuance costs and million for the premium paid on the redemption of million of our convertible debt in june further  interest expense in included million of interest related to borrowings under bank lines of credit and to borrowings from philips under the philips credit facility  which was terminated prior to the august debt offering 
amortization of our remaining convertible note issuance costs will total approximately million per quarter through other  net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses on transactions and realized and unrealized gains and losses on the changes in fair value of derivative contracts entered into to hedge these transactions 
the million loss in primarily relates to a loss on our forward extra contracts in the first quarter of  which was prior to our achieving hedge treatment of such contracts 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a million gain on such contracts 
currency related losses totaled million in  million in and million in in addition  beginning in july  we entered into various forward exchange contracts to partially mitigate the impact of changes in the euro against the dollar on our manufacturing and operating expenses in europe 
prior to achieving hedge treatment of such contracts in the second quarter of  we marked to market any contracts that were not realized in a given quarter 
the realized and unrealized gains related to these contracts totaled million in see liquidity and capital resources below for a discussion of the changes in our cash and investment balances during see also item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk below for a discussion of our foreign currency gains and losses and hedging activities 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate was in  in and in our effective tax rate may differ from the united states federal statutory tax rate primarily as a result of the effects of state and foreign taxes and our use of the foreign export benefit  research and experimentation tax credits earned in the united states  adjustments to our tax contingency reserves and other factors 
in addition to the factors mentioned above  our effective income tax rate can be affected by changes in statutory tax rates in the united states and foreign jurisdictions  our ability or inability to utilize various carry forward tax items  changes in tax laws in the united states governing research and experimentation credits  the foreign export benefit  and other factors 
the american jobs creation act of  enacted october   repealed the extraterritorial income exclusion eti 
transition rules  however  kept the exclusion for we currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be approximately based on the forecasted mix of income between the united states and foreign jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the reduction of reserves held for tax contingencies and additional reserves and experimentation credits 
the effective tax rate decreased compared to the rate for primarily due to our release of valuation allowances on deferred taxes for foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity and capital resources as of december  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents  short term restricted cash and short term investments  million in non current investments  million of long term restricted cash  million of available borrowings under our existing credit facilities  as well as potential future cash flows from operations 
restricted cash relates to bank guarantees that expire through december we believe that these sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to meet our expected operational and capital needs through at least in the year ended december   cash and cash equivalents increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  primarily as a result of million provided by operations  the positive impact of currency of million  million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options  net sales of investments and marketable securities of million and million related to the repayment of a shareholder note receivable 
these increases were partially offset by million used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment  million used for an investment in convertible debt and equity of an unconsolidated subsidiary and million used for development of software 
accounts receivable increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  primarily due to the increase in total revenue in the third and fourth quarters of compared to the third and fourth quarters of in addition  million of the increase related to changes in currency rates 
our days sales outstanding  calculated on a quarterly basis  was days at december  compared to days at december  the increase as of december  compared to december   was primarily due to a greater volume of shipments in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of inventories decreased million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  the decrease was primarily was due to more efficient management and usage of our inventory  partially offset by a million increase due to changes in currency rates 
our annualized inventory turnover rate  calculated on a quarterly basis  was times and times for the quarters ended december  and  respectively 
expenditures for property  plant and equipment of million in primarily were for customer evaluation systems 
we expect to continue to invest in capital equipment  customer evaluation systems and research and development equipment for applications development 
we estimate our total capital expenditures in to be approximately million  primarily for the development and introduction of new products and a new enterprise resource planning erp system 
other assets  which include service inventories  capitalized software development costs  note issuance costs  trademarks  patents  deposits and other long term assets  increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  significant components of other assets are summarized as follows in thousands balance at december  additions amortization write offs and other adjustments balance at december  current quarterly amortization service inventories  net     n a capitalized software development costs   note issuance costs    investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries    n a patents  trademarks and other intangible assets  other adjustments primarily include disposal of service inventory against the excess and obsolescence valuation adjustment and translation adjustments 
the increase in service inventories primarily is for service support requirements related to certain product sales that occurred in we expect to continue to invest in software development as we develop new software for our existing products and for our new products under development 
in addition to our million of convertible debt outstanding  we maintain a million unsecured  committed bank borrowing facility in the united states  a million unsecured and uncommitted bank borrowing facility in japan and various limited facilities in select foreign countries used in connection with product sales 
in addition  we maintain a million unsecured and uncommitted bank facility in the united states and a million facility in the netherlands for the purpose of issuing standby letters of credit and bank guarantees 
at december   a total of million was available under these facilities 
at december   we had outstanding standby letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling approximately million to secure customer advance deposits  million of which are secured by our restricted cash balance

we utilize the residual method under which revenue is allocated to the undelivered element  based on vendor specific evidence of fair value  and the residual amount of revenue is allocated to the delivered element 
we recognize license revenues upon delivery of the software 
we generally provide consulting and training services on a time and materials basis and provide maintenance and support services under renewable  term maintenance agreements 
maintenance and support fee revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual term  which is generally months  and commences from delivery of product 
amounts received prior to services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue  with recognition commencing upon service delivery 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on past collection problems and known trends with current customers 
the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies somewhat mitigates our credit risk exposure and the magnitude of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes to the reserve occur based upon changes in revenue levels and associated balances in accounts receivable and estimated changes in credit quality 
historically  we have not incurred significant write offs of accounts receivable  however  an individual loss could be significant due to the relative size of our sales transactions 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and valuation of excess and obsolete inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined by standard cost methods  which approximate the first in  first out method 
inventory costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
inventory is reviewed for obsolescence and excess quantities on a quarterly basis  based on estimated future use of quantities on hand  which is determined based on past usage  planned changes to products and known trends in markets and technology 
changes in support plans or technology could have a significant impact on obsolescence 
because of the long lived nature of many of our products  we maintain a substantial supply of parts for possible use in future repairs and customer field service 
as these service parts become older  we apply a higher percentage of reserve against the recorded balance  recognizing that the older the part  the less likely it is ultimately to be used 
total valuation adjustments included in inventory were million and million  respectively  at december  and lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets we evaluate the remaining life and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if there is an indication of impairment  we prepare an estimate of future  undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
no such adjustments were made in  or goodwill goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations  is evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we perform our annual impairment test in november each year 
to perform that test  we compare the carrying value of our business segments to our estimates of the fair value of each of those segments 
if the fair value of a business segment is less than its carrying value  we will write down the related goodwill to its implied fair value 
we use estimates of future cash flows  discounted to present value  and other measures of fair value to estimate the relative fair value of each of our business segments 
it is reasonably possible that our estimates of future cash flows  discount rates and other assumptions inherent in the calculation of the estimated fair value of each business segment will change in the future  which could cause us to write down goodwill at that time 
we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in  or existing technology intangible assets existing technology intangible assets purchased in business combinations  which represent the estimated value of products utilizing technology existing as of the combination date discounted to their net present value  are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the technology 
we currently are using amortization periods ranging from to years for these assets 
changes in technology could affect our estimates of the useful lives of such assets 
we test our technology intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
we evaluate recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon estimates of future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate 
we review the estimated useful lives of the assets on an annual basis 
we have not changed estimated useful lives or recognized impairment charges related to our technology intangible assets during  or software development costs we capitalize certain software development costs for software expected to be sold independently or within our products 
such costs are capitalized after the technological feasibility of the project is determined and are reported on the balance sheet in other assets 
once we begin to include such software in our products  these costs are amortized over the estimated economic life of the software  which is usually years 
changes in technology could affect our estimate of the useful life of such assets 
capitalized software development costs totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and current amortization totals approximately million per quarter 
restructuring and reorganization costs restructuring and reorganization costs are recognized and recorded at fair value as incurred in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
restructuring and reorganization costs include severance and other costs related to employee terminations as well as facility costs related to future abandonment of various leased office and manufacturing sites 
changes in our estimates could occur  and have occurred  due to fluctuations in exchange rates  the sublease of unused space  unanticipated voluntary departures before severance was required and unanticipated redeployment of employees to vacant positions 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to more likely than not be realized in our future tax returns 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  adjustments to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required 
our net deferred tax assets totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and warranty liabilities our products generally carry a one year warranty 
a reserve is established at the time of sale to cover estimated warranty costs and certain commitments for product upgrades 
our estimate of warranty cost is primarily based on our history of warranty repairs and maintenance  as applied to systems currently under warranty 
for our new products without a history of known warranty costs  we estimate the expected costs based on our experience with similar product lines and technology 
while most new products are extensions of existing technology  the estimate could change if new products require a significantly different level of repair and maintenance than similar products have required in the past 
our estimated warranty costs are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes to the reserve occur as volume  product mix and warranty costs fluctuate 
our warranty reserve totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and warranty expense totaled million  million and million  respectively  during  and stock based compensation we measure compensation expense for our stock based employee compensation plans using the method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we provide disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the method prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
compensation expense  net of tax  calculated pursuant to sfas no 
totaled million  million and million  respectively  in  and see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
accounting for derivatives we use foreign forward extra contracts a combination of forward exchange and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions 
when specific criteria required by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  have been met  changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income 
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions 
by their nature  our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions 
when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels  or when the timing of transactions changes significantly  we reclassify a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other income expense during the quarter in which such changes occur 
we also use foreign forward exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exchange impact of our cash  receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
these derivatives do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting 
changes in fair value for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recognized in net income in the current period 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk a large portion of our business is conducted outside of the united states through a number of foreign subsidiaries 
each of the foreign subsidiaries keeps its accounting records in its respective local currency 
these local currency denominated accounting records are translated at exchange rates that fluctuate up or down from period to period and consequently affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
the major foreign currencies in which we experience periodic fluctuations are the euro  the czech koruna  the japanese yen and the british pound sterling 
although for each of the last three years more than of our sales occurred outside of the united states  a large portion of these foreign sales were denominated in united states dollars and euros 
in addition  because of our substantial research  development and manufacturing operations in europe  we incur a greater proportion of our costs in europe than the revenue we derive from sales in that geographic region 
our raw materials  labor and other manufacturing costs are primarily denominated in united states dollars  euros and czech korunas 
this situation negatively affects our gross margins and results of operations when the dollar weakens in relation to the euro or koruna 
a strengthening of the dollar in relation to the euro or koruna would have a positive effect on our gross margins and results of operations 
movement of asian currencies in relation to the dollar and euro also can affect our reported sales and results of operations because we derive more revenue than we incur costs from the asia pacific region 
in addition  several of our competitors are based in japan and a weakening of the japanese yen has the effect of lowering their prices relative to ours 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments increased shareholders equity and comprehensive income in by million 
holding other variables constant  if the united states dollar weakened by against all currencies that we translate  shareholders equity would increase by approximately million as of december  holding other variables constant  if the united states dollar strengthened by against all currencies that we translate  shareholders equity would decrease by approximately million as of december  risk mitigation we use derivatives to mitigate financial exposure resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
when specific accounting criteria have been met  changes in fair values of derivative contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income  rather than net income  until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income 
changes in fair value for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recognized in net income in the current period 
as of december   the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding derivative contracts was million  which contracts have varying maturities through september holding other variables constant  if the united states dollar weakened by  the market value of our foreign currency contracts outstanding as of december  would increase by approximately million 
the increase in value relating to the forward sale or purchase contracts would  however  be substantially offset by the revaluation of the transactions being hedged 
a increase in the united states dollar relative to the hedged currencies would have a similar  but negative  effect on the value of our foreign currency contracts  substantially offset again by the revaluation of the transactions being hedged 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
balance sheet related we attempt to mitigate our currency exposures for recorded transactions by using forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our future cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
we enter into forward sale or purchase contracts for foreign currencies to hedge specific cash  receivables or payables positions denominated in foreign currencies 
changes in fair value of derivatives entered into to mitigate the foreign exchange risks related to these balance sheet items are recorded in other income expense currently together with the transaction gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position 
cash flow hedges beginning in july  we began using foreign forward extra contracts a combination of forward exchange and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions 
the foreign exchange hedging structure is set up on a nine month time horizon 
the hedging transactions we undertake primarily limit our exposure to changes in the dollar euro exchange rate 
the hedges have a bias to protect us as the dollar weakens  but also provide us with some flexibility if the dollar strengthens 
prior to the second quarter of  we did not meet the criteria to treat these derivatives as hedges and  accordingly  the changes in fair value were recorded in net income 
we recorded unrealized losses of million and realized gains of million related to these contracts in the first quarter of fiscal as a component of other income 
in the second quarter of  these derivatives met the criteria to be designated as hedges and  prospectively  we record the change in fair value of these hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income 
we recognized realized gains of million in in cost of sales related to hedge results 
as of december   million of deferred unrealized net gains on outstanding derivatives have been recorded in other comprehensive income and are expected to be reclassified to net income during the next nine months as a result of the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in net income 
no amounts were recorded in other comprehensive income for such hedges as of december  interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relate to our investments 
since we have no variable interest rate debt outstanding at december   our interest expense is relatively fixed and not affected by changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this objective is accomplished by making diversified investments  consisting only of investment grade securities 
as of december   we held cash and cash equivalents of million and short term restricted cash of million that consisted of cash and highly liquid short term investments having maturity dates of no more than days at the date of acquisition 
declines of interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our highly liquid short term investments 
a decrease in interest rates of one percentage point would cause a corresponding decrease in annual interest income by approximately million assuming our cash and cash equivalent balances at december  remained constant 
due to the nature of our highly liquid cash equivalents  an increase in interest rates would not materially change the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we held short and long term fixed rate investments of million that consisted of corporate notes and bonds  government backed securities  variable rate notes and other equity securities 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows  as we have the intent and ability to hold these fixed rate investments until maturity 
declines in interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our short term investments  as our short term portfolio is re invested at current market interest rates 
a decrease in interest rates of one percentage point would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income from these items of less than million assuming our investment balances at december  remained constant 
the following table summarizes the weighted average yields and expected maturity or liquidation dates of each type of our investments as of december  dollars in thousands in year in years in years total variable rate notes   weighted average yield government backed securities     weighted average yield corporate notes and bonds     weighted average yield fair value of fixed rate debt the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the interest rate changes affect the fair market value of our long term debt  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
at december   we had million of long term fixed interest rate debt outstanding 
based on open market trades  we have determined that the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt was approximately million at december
