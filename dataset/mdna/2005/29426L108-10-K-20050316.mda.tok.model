new accounting pronouncements in april  the eitf reached final consensus on eitf  participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 which requires companies that have participating securities to calculate earnings per share using the two class method 
this method requires the allocation of undistributed earnings to the common shares and participating securities based on the proportion of undistributed earnings that each would have been entitled to had all the period s earnings been distributed 
eitf is effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  and earnings per share reported in prior periods presented must be retroactively adjusted in order to comply with eitf the company adopted eitf for the quarter ended june  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on the company s earnings per share calculation 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides new guidelines for the evaluation and determination of whether a loss on certain investments is other than temporary and requires certain additional disclosures pertaining to unrealized investment losses in a company s financial statements 
the effective date of the evaluation and measurement criteria of issue no 
have been delayed pending issuance of additional implementation guidance by the fasb 
the additional disclosure requirements  however  remain effective for annual periods ending after december  management continues to monitor the fasb s progress and does not currently expect the adoption of the evaluation and measurement criteria  once issued to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment to replace sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires  among other things  that all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options  be measured based on their grant date fair value and recognized as expense in the financial statements effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  unless observable market prices exist  the grant date fair value is estimated using an appropriate option pricing model as determined by management 
management must also make certain assumptions about employee exercise habits  forfeiture rates and select an appropriate amortization methodology for recognizing compensation expense 
the statement requires a modified prospective method of adoption 
under this method  compensation expense will be recorded in the financial statements for all awards granted after july  and the future vesting of awards outstanding as of july  companies may also elect to restate their previously issued financial statements to provide consistency across all periods presented under a modified retrospective method 
management believes the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and earnings per share  but has not yet determined the method of adoption or whether adoption will result in expense amounts materially different from those provided under the current pro forma disclosures in note item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s cash and cash equivalents and its credit facility 
at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents 
based on the investment interest rate  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately  on an annual basis  and likewise decrease the company s earnings and cash flows 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company places its investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company is averse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the company s interest expense associated with its credit facility will vary with market rates 
the company had million in variable rate debt outstanding at december  based upon these variable rate debt levels  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately  on an annual basis  and likewise decrease the company s earnings and cash flows 
the company cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on its variable rate debt  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate long term debt will be available to the company at favorable rates  if at all 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above 
foreign currency risk 
the company transacts business in various foreign currencies  primarily in certain european countries  canada and australia 
the company does not have any hedging or similar foreign currency contracts 
international revenues represented of the company s total revenues for the year ended december  and of revenues were denominated in foreign currencies

given a hypothetical increase of in the euro against the great britain pound  the realized transaction gain would increase by approximately  at december   and likewise increase the company s earnings and cash flows
