item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report 
overview we design  develop  license and market memory technologies used by the semiconductor industry and electronic product manufacturers 
we have developed a patented semiconductor memory technology  called t sram  that offers a combination of high density  low power consumption and high speed at performance and cost levels that other available memory technologies do not match 
we license this technology to companies that incorporate  or embed  memory on complex integrated circuits  such as socs 
we have also sold memory chips based on our t sram technologies 
in the second quarter of  we notified customers of our decision to discontinue the sale of our memory chip products 
using elements of our existing memory technology as a foundation  we completed development of our first memory chips incorporating our t sram technologies in the fourth quarter of we signed our first license agreement related to our t sram technologies at the end of the fourth quarter of and recognized licensing revenue from our t sram technologies for the first time in the first quarter of we have introduced improved and enhanced versions of our technology  t sram r  t stram m  and t sram q 
we generate revenue from the licensing of our intellectual property  which consists of both licensing revenues and royalties 
our licensing revenue consists of fees paid for engineering development and engineering support services 
royalty revenues are earned under each of our licensing agreements when our licensees manufacture or sell products that incorporate any of our t sram technologies and report the results to us 
as of december   we had signed license agreements related to our t sram technologies with companies  of which have paid us royalties to date 
generally  we expect our total sales cycle  or the period from our initial discussion with a prospective licensee to our receipt of royalties from the licensee s use of our t sram technologies  to run from to months after the commencement of the project 
during  we purchased atmos corporation  a semiconductor memory company focused on creating high density  compiler generated embedded memory solutions for soc applications 
effective november   we closed the atmos research and development facility in canada and terminated the employment of approximately employees working there 
restructuring charges related to the closure of approximately  were included in the results 
sources of revenue we generate three types of revenue licensing  royalties and product sales 
prior to  we derived almost all our revenue from the sale of memory chips 
since the beginning of  product revenue as a percentage of our total revenue has declined significantly  while licensing and royalty revenues have grown substantially as a percentage of total revenue 
in the third quarter of  for the first time  combined license and royalty revenue exceeded product revenue 
by the end of third quarter of  we had exited the product business except for minor ongoing sales of products required from time to time by customers 
licensing 
our license agreements involve long sales cycles  which makes it difficult to predict when the agreements will be signed and when  if ever  we will recognize revenues under the agreements 
in addition  our licensing revenues fluctuate from period to period  and  it is difficult for us to predict the timing and magnitude of such revenue from quarter to quarter 
moreover  we believe that the amount of licensing revenues for any period is not necessarily indicative of results in any future period 
our future revenue results are subject to a number of factors  particularly those described in part i  business risk factors 
our licensing revenue consists of fees for providing circuit design  layout and design verification and granting a license to a customer that is embedding our memory technology into its product 
for some customers  we also provide engineering support services to assist in the commencement of production of products utilizing the licensed t sram technologies 
license fees generally range from one hundred thousand dollars to several million dollars per contract  depending on the scope and complexity of the development project  the licensee s rights and licensee generally pays the license fees in installments at the beginning of the license term and upon the attainment of specified milestones 
the vast majority of our contracts allow billing between milestones based on work performed 
all license agreements entered into to date require us to meet performance specifications 
for agreements involving performance specifications that we have not met and for which we lack the historical experience to reasonably estimate the costs  we defer recognition of revenue until the licensee manufactures products that meet the contract performance specifications and recognize revenue under the completed contract accounting method 
fees collected prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred contract revenue 
however  if the agreement involves performance specifications that we have significant experience in meeting and the cost of contract completion can be reasonably estimated  we recognize revenue over the period in which the contract services are performed under the percentage of completion accounting method 
revenue is recognized when collectibility is probable 
we use actual direct labor hours incurred to measure progress towards completion 
if the amount of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method exceeds the amount of billings to a customer  then under the percentage of completion accounting method  we account for the excess amount as an unbilled contract receivable 
our total unbilled contract receivable was   and  as of december    and  respectively 
from time to time  a licensee may cancel a project during the development phase 
such a cancellation is not within our control and is often caused by changes in market conditions or the licensee s business 
cancellations of this nature are an aspect of our licensing business  and most of our newer contracts allow us to retain all payments that we have received or are entitled to collect for items and services provided before the cancellation occurs 
we will consider a project to have been canceled even in the absence of specific notice from our licensee  if there has been no activity under the contract for a significant period  and we believe that completion of the contract is unlikely 
in this event  we recognize revenue in the amount of cash received  if we have performed a sufficient portion of the development 
if a cancelled contract had been entered into before the establishment of technological feasibility  the costs associated with the contract would have been expensed prior to the recognition of revenue 
in that case  there would be no costs associated with that revenue recognition  and gross margin would increase for the corresponding period 
in  we recognized no licensing revenue from cancelled contracts compared to  in and  in royalties 
each license agreement provides for royalty payments at a stated rate 
we negotiate royalty rates by taking into account such factors as the anticipated volume of the licensee s sales of products utilizing our technologies and the cost savings to be achieved by the licensee through the use of our technology 
our license agreements require the licensee to report the manufacture or sale of products that include our technology after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs 
we recognize royalties from reports provided by the licensee that are received in the quarter immediately following the quarter during which the licensee has sold or manufactured products containing our technology 
as with our licensing revenues  the timing and level of royalties are difficult to predict 
they depend on the licensee s ability to market  produce and sell products incorporating our technology 
many of the products of our licensees that are currently subject to licenses from us are consumer products  such as electronic game consoles  for which demand can be seasonal and generally highest in the fourth quarter 
we would report royalties from products sold in the fourth quarter in the first quarter of the following year 
if a licensee holds excess inventory of products using our licensed technology  we are unlikely to report additional royalty revenue attributable to that product until the quarter after the licensee restarts production 
for a discussion of factors that could contribute to the fluctuation of our revenues  see part i business risk factors our lengthy licensing cycle and our licensees lengthy development cycles will make the operating results of our licensing business difficult to predict  and anything that negatively affects the business of our licensees could negatively impact our revenue 
product sales 
product sales are typically on a purchase order basis  with shipment of product occurring from one to six months later 
allowances for sales returns or warranty liabilities are recorded based upon historical experiences and any specific known pending customer returns 
our products are manufactured  assembled and tested prior to shipment by independent  third party contractors 
we contract for manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and have no long term commitments for the supply of any of our memory chip products 
in the second quarter of  we have notified customers of our decision to discontinue sale of our memory chip products 
as of the end of the third quarter of  we had no remaining product inventory 
accordingly  we will have only minor ongoing sales of products required from time to time by customers 
critical accounting policies use of estimates 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis we make these estimates based on our historical experience and on assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and reported results could differ under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following accounting policies are affected by estimates and judgments in the following manner revenue 
license 
in accordance with sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  when license agreements include deliverables that require significant production  modification or customization  contract accounting is applied 
if a licensing contract involves performance specifications that we have significant experience in meeting and the direct labor hours to be incurred to complete the contract can be reasonably estimated  we recognize the revenue over the period in which the contract services are performed using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method includes judgmental elements  such as determining that we have the experience to meet the design specifications and estimation of the total direct labor hours 
we follow this method because we can obtain reasonably dependable estimates of the direct labor hours to perform the contracted services 
the direct labor hours for the development of the licensee s design are estimated at the beginning of the contract 
as these direct labor hours are incurred  they are used as a measure of progress towards completion 
we have the ability to reasonably estimate direct labor hours on a contract to contract basis from our experience in developing prior licensee s designs 
during the contract performance period we review estimates of direct labor hours to complete the contracts as the contract progresses to completion and will revise our estimates of revenue and gross profit under the contract if we revise the estimations of the direct labor hours to complete 
our policy is to reflect any revision in the contract gross profit estimate in reported income in the period in which the facts giving rise to the revision become known 
under the percentage of completion method  provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined 
for contracts involving design specifications that we have not met previously  we defer the recognition of revenue until the design meets the contractual design specifications and expenses the cost of services as incurred 
when we have experience in meeting design specifications but do not have significant experience to reasonably estimate the direct labor hours related to services to meet a design specification  we defer both the recognition of revenue and the cost 
for these arrangements  we recognize revenue using the completed contract method 
under the completed contract method  we recognize revenue when we have knowledge that the customer has successfully verified our design 
under our support and maintenance arrangements  we provide unspecified upgrades  design rule changes and technical support 
no other upgrades  products or other post contract support are provided 
these arrangements are renewable annually by the customer 
support and maintenance revenue is recognized at its fair value ratably over the period during which the obligation exists  typically months 
the fair value of any support and maintenance obligation is established based on the specified renewal rate for such support and maintenance 
when we provide a combination of products and services to customers  in addition to the considerations noted above  we evaluate the arrangements under eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
product 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
for each of the periods presented  there were no formal acceptance provisions with our end customers 
royalty 
licensing contracts provide also for royalty payments at a stated rate and require licensees to report the manufacture or sale of products that include our t sram technologies after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs 
we recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee s report 
goodwill 
we review goodwill  recorded from the acquisition of atmos corp 
on august  for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
using the guidance in sfas no 
 we consider there to be only one reporting unit at the entity level 
for step one  we determine the fair value of our reporting unit using the market approach 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on the market value of the reporting unit at the entity level 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of net assets assigned to the reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
we performed the annual impairment test during the third quarter of and the test did not indicate impairment of goodwill as of september  as of december   we found no indicators of potential impairment 
restructuring charges 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded significant restructuring charges related to the closure of our atmos research and development facility in canada 
those charges represented expenses incurred due to severance and fringe benefits and lease abandonment in connection with the closure of the facility 
restructuring charges for exit costs require the use of estimates  primarily related to the cost of exiting facilities  including estimates and assumptions related to future maintenance costs  our ability to secure a sub tenant  if applicable  and any sublease income to be received in the future 
we accounted for the restructuring charges under sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
if we fail to make accurate estimates regarding these costs or to accurately estimate the timing of the completion of planned activities  we may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions in the future 
tax valuation allowance 
when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability for each of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our consolidated balance sheet under the category of other current assets 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon weighted available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period  we must record a tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations unless the increase is attributable to stock based compensation deductions  which has been recorded directly to equity 
we must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of approximately million  of which approximately million was attributable to canadian net operating losses and million was attributable to us and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
results of operations the following discussion compares the historical results of operations based on us generally accepted accounting principles for the years ended december   and results of operations as a percentage of net revenue were as follows year ended december  net revenue product licensing 
royalty cost of net revenue product licensing gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring expense total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income provision for income taxes net income loss years ended december   and revenue 
in  total revenue decreased to million representing a decline from total revenue in the decline was mainly attributable to a significant decrease in licensing revenue  which declined to million in from million in licensing revenue decreased in because we did not add new licensing projects to offset the decrease in licensing revenue earned from older projects that we completed in in  we reduced revenue by  for a reimbursement given to a customer for excess verification costs incurred by the customer 
royalty revenue decreased to million in from million in  which included a one time past due royalty payment of approximately  from conexant in excluding that one time payment  total royalties in declined by approximately  from  as customer sales of chips incorporating our technology declined 
for example  royalties related to the production of nintendo gamecube chips represented million in compared to million in in  total revenue decreased to million from million representing a decline from the decline was mainly attributable to a significant decrease in royalty revenue  which declined to million in from million in gamecube related revenue represented of our total revenue in  a decrease from of our total revenue in as nintendo reduced its purchases of chips incorporating our licensed technology for its gamecube consoles 
royalty revenues from other licensees increased in compared to  however  mainly due to increased sales of royalty bearing products first shipped in licensing revenue also decreased slightly to million in from million in as we earned licensing revenue from our new projects started in largely offset the decrease in licensing revenue earned from the older projects completed in during the second quarter of  we collected million in cash from conexant for the termination of its october license agreement with us 
that payment consisted of current and past due royalty payments totaling  and a contract termination fee of  which we included in other income 
in  total revenue was million primarily from licensing and royalty activities 
royalties earned from the sale of gamecube chips incorporating our t sram technology represented a significant portion of our total revenue in royalty revenues from other licensees also increased in as we simultaneously increased and diversified our licensees and development projects during that year 
majority of licensing revenue earned in was derived from development projects other than gamecube related projects 
during the years ended december    and  our product sales totaled  million and million  respectively 
sales of our memory chips have declined steadily as we shifted our primary focus from product sales to the licensing of our t sram technologies after in the second quarter of  we notified customers of our decision to discontinue sale of our memory chip products 
as of the end of the third quarter of  we had no remaining product inventory of value 
accordingly  we will only have minor ongoing sales of products required from time to time by customers 
we have approximately  of product revenue from the products shipped from the inventory previously written off in gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in primarily due to the significant decline in our licensing revenue 
our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in from in primarily due to the decline in licensing gross profit which fell to in from in this decline occurred because we incurred higher cost in fulfilling our obligations under new license agreements than we had originally estimated or had historically experienced 
in addition  we recognized revenue under some lower margin license projects including a few contracts in which our estimated cost exceeded the amount of revenue to be recognized 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in primarily due to the significant decline in our royalty revenue  which has no associated costs 
primarily for this reason  our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in from in licensing gross profit declined to in from in primarily because we recognized revenue under some lower margin license projects in in  product gross margin as a percentage of product revenue decreased to compared to in mainly due to an inventory write off of approximately  in  which was not previously reserved for 
in  product gross margin as a percentage of product revenue decreased to compared to in the decline resulted primarily from lower average selling prices for our memory chips in in addition  in our fixed manufacturing overhead costs were spread over a reduced number of our memory chips shipped in compared to research and development 
our research and development expenses include development and design of variations of the t sram technologies for use in different manufacturing processes used by licensees and the development and testing of prototypes to prove the technological feasibility of embedding our memory designs in the licensees products 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in mainly because more engineering time was spent on licensing development projects  therefore  more engineering expenses were allocated to cost of licensing revenue in compared to effective november   we closed the atmos research and development facility in ottawa  canada and terminated the employment of approximately employees working there 
atmos research and development expenses represented approximately million in research and development expenses increased to million in from million in because we had increased engineering staff from our acquisition of atmos and to support our memory compiler development 
atmos research and development expenses represented approximately million in in  research and development expense increased to million due to additions to the engineering staff from additional hiring and our acquisition of atmos at the end of august the atmos research and development expenses represented approximately  in selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in due primarily to million of expenses related to the aborted acquisition by synopsys  inc  litigation expenses related to litigation with synopsys over its abandonment of the acquisition and litigation expenses with respect to the patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation suit brought against us by uniram technology  inc in  expenses related to testing and assessment of effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required by section of sarbanes oxley act were approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in due primarily to increased sales and marketing activities  including the establishment of a sales office in japan in january and higher professional fees 
we do not expect to incur legal expenses at the level we did in in future periods 
restructuring charges 
on november   we announced our plan to close the atmos research and development facility in canada in order to reduce operating expenses and to further align our business with market conditions  future revenue expectations and planned future product direction 
as a part of the plan  we implemented a reduction in workforce of approximately employees  which represented of our workforce 
in addition  we are attempting to sublease the atmos research and development facility  which we occupy under long term operating leases through we recorded restructuring costs of  in the fourth quarter of  consisting of  of severance and fringe benefits and lease abandonment charges of  at december  we have a total restructuring accrual of  comprised of unpaid employee severance costs of  and estimated lease abandonment costs of  all employees to be affected by our reduction in workforce were notified of the termination of their employment on november  estimates related to sublease costs and income were based on assumptions regarding sublease rates and the time required to locate sub lessees  which were derived from market trend information provided by a commercial real estate broker 
we review these estimates periodically if these assumptions materially change due to rental market factors  the ultimate restructuring expense for the abandoned facilities would be adjusted 
the following table summarizes the activities under the restructuring plan abandoned space severance related total in thousands provision cash payments foreign exchange fluctuations restructuring liability at december  less current portion long term portion of restructuring liability interest and other income 
interest and other income increased to million in from million in primarily because of a million termination fee paid by synopsys  inc related to the aborted acquisition 
in addition  interest income increased slightly to million in from million in as income attributable to higher interest rates in was impacted adversely by the requirement that we liquidated the short term and long term investments in the second quarter of prior to the abandonment of its acquisition of our company by synopsys  inc in  interest and other income increased to million from million in primarily due to the  contract termination fee from conexant and  of canadian research and development incentive tax credits 
interest income was million and million in and  respectively 
this fluctuation in interest income levels corresponded to differences in average cash and investment balances for the periods and the applicable corresponding interest rates  which declined each year in and there was no other income recorded in we incurred no interest expense in   and deferred stock based compensation cost to employees 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded deferred compensation cost of approximately   and  respectively  which cost would be amortized in future periods 
the deferred compensation cost represents the intrinsic value of options granted to purchase shares of our stock to newly appointed members of our board of directors that had an exercise price less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the option grant 
this deferred compensation cost will be amortized over the vesting period of months using the graded vesting method 
the deferred compensation cost represented the shares of common stock issued to certain employees of atmos as part of the acquisition that were subject to vesting requirements  which cost is being amortized over the vesting period of months using the graded vesting method 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded stock compensation expenses of   and  respectively  of which   and  respectively  was attributable to the excess of the fair market value of our common stock over the price at which we granted stock options to employees 
stock compensation expenses in  and also included   and  respectively  for amortization of deferred compensation cost attributable to the fair market value of shares of our common stock issued to certain employees of atmos 
in addition  we incurred  of stock compensation expense in related to the issuance of options to purchase our stock to newly appointed members of our board of directors that had an exercise price less than the fair market value of our stock on the date of the option grant 
we also incurred  of stock compensation expense in due to modification of our employee stock option held by a former member of our board of directors 
deferred compensation expense is being amortized using the graded vesting method over the vesting period of each respective option  generally four years 
the accelerated amortization results in expensing approximately of the total award in the first year  in the second year  in the third year and in the fourth year 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 share based payment sfas r which will become effective beginning in the third quarter of sfas r will result in the recognition of substantial compensation expense relating to our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
under the new rules  we are required to adopt a fair value based method for measuring the compensation expense related to employee stock awards and therefore this will lead to substantial additional compensation expense that will be included in our results of operations 
provision for income taxes 
provisions for income taxes of approximately   and million  were recorded in   and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate was negative for and for each of and as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes  approximately million for state tax purposes and approximately million for canadian tax purposes that we expect to be available to reduce future income tax liabilities to the extent permitted under federal  canadian and applicable state income tax laws 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire from to in  we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will be less than the federal statutory tax rate but higher than the effective income tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million resulting in a total balance of cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million 
as of the same date  the company had total working capital of million 
in july  the company completed the sale of a total of  shares of common stock in its initial public offering 
the company realized total net proceeds of approximately million upon the close of the ipo  which proceeds have not been used to fund our operations to date 
our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs 
we believe that our current focus on licensing and royalty revenues with reduced levels of memory chip sales has generally enabled us to steadily improve our cash position 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended   and  respectively 
in  net cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net loss of million offset by a non cash charge of million for depreciation and amortization  reduced unbilled contract receivables of million  and prepaid expenses and other assets of  which included a reduction in deferred tax assets in in addition  net cash provided by operating activities in included restructuring related liabilities of in  net cash provided by operating activities was principally represented by our net profit of million plus a non cash charge of million for depreciation and amortization  although deferred revenue associated with cash receipts in excess of recognized revenue declined by million 
in  net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net income of million plus a non cash charge of depreciation and amortization of million 
prepaid expenses and other assets increased by million as we recorded deferred tax assets of million from the realization of tax benefits through the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  deferred revenue declined by million and accounts payable declined by million 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million in net cash used in investing activities was approximately million and million for the years ended and aside from investing in marketable securities  we purchased  and  of property and equipment in and  respectively  consisting principally of engineering design software 
in  we purchased million of property and equipment mainly consisting of engineering design software and used million for the acquisition of atmos 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million in and net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended and in  the major financing use of cash was million for the repurchase of million shares of common stock 
we received proceeds in the amount of million from the exercise of employee options to purchase common stock during as of december   approximately million remained available for repurchase of common stock under the existing repurchase authorization 
cash received upon the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of options totaled million in and  in our future liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter  depending on numerous factors  including level and timing of licensing and royalty revenues  cost  timing and success of technology development efforts  market acceptance of our existing and future technologies and products  competing technological and market developments  cost of maintaining and enforcing patent claims and intellectual property rights  variations in manufacturing yields  materials costs and other manufacturing risks  costs of acquiring other businesses and integrating the acquired operations  profitability of our business  and litigation expenses 
we expect that existing cash  and equivalents  short term and long term investments along with our existing capital and cash generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we expect that a licensing business such as ours generally will require less cash to support operations after multiple licensees begin to ship products and pay royalties 
however  we cannot be certain that we will not require additional financing at some point in time 
should our cash resources prove inadequate  we may need to raise additional funding through public or private financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
the failure to raise capital when needed could have a material  adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
lease commitments and off balance sheet financing the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payment due by period total less than year years years over years operating lease obligations the company did not have any unconditional purchase obligations as of december  recent accounting pronouncements see note of the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussion of market interest rate risk our investment portfolio consists of money market funds  corporate backed debt obligations and mortgage backed government obligations generally due within one year 
our primary objective with investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
in accordance with our investment policy  we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
these securities  which approximate million as of december   and have an average interest rate of approximately  which are subject to interest rate risks 
however  based on the investment portfolio contents and our ability to hold these investments until maturity  we believe that if a significant change in interest rates were to occur  it would not have a material effect on our financial condition
