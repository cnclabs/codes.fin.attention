item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are one of the ten largest regional ltl carriers in the united states based on revenues  according to transport topics  generating approximately million in revenue during in our operations  we pick up and deliver multiple shipments for multiple customers on each trailer 
the history of the name central freight lines and its franchise dates back to  when central freight lines was founded in waco  texas and served the intrastate texas ltl market for decades 
our company began its operations effective june   when our chairman of the board  jerry moyes  organized our company and acquired the central freight lines name  terminal network  and physical assets from the southwestern division of viking freight lines  whose corporate group acquired our predecessor in prior to  we conducted our operations almost exclusively in our eight state southwest region  which is anchored by texas and california 
since  a significant portion of our business has continued to be concentrated in our southwest region 
through the following two expansions  however  we have increased the geographic scope of our business o in december  we expanded service in a seven state  midwest region  establishing all points coverage in six of these states 
our expenses for the year ended december   reflect the costs of this midwest expansion  primarily consisting of purchased transportation  employee training  and relocation expenses 
we increased our use of purchased transportation in the midwest region as a more efficient method of transporting freight in lanes where we do not yet have sufficient freight volume to profitably transport the freight in our own trucks 
as we continue to develop our operations in the midwest  we expect our purchased transportation costs to return to historical levels 
o in march  we expanded into the pacific northwest through the purchase of selected terminal network and rolling stock of eoff  a non union ltl carrier that operated in the states of oregon  washington  and idaho 
the selected assets of eoff were purchased for approximately million  with the purchase price paid from cash reserves 
the assets acquired included six owned terminal properties  fifteen leased terminal properties  tractors  and trailers 
recent results of operations and year end financial condition in  for reasons discussed below  we reported a loss from operations of approximately million  and our operating ratio for the year was 
a summary of our recent performance in each of the four quarters of is as follows first quarter in the first quarter  we reported marginally positive income from operations  and a net loss of million  on revenue of million 
our operating ratio for the quarter was 
we attribute these results  in part  to additional expenses from our accelerated northwest expansion 
these additional expenses mainly related to additional employees  terminal leases  and employee relocations 
the northwest expansion also contributed to lower overall productivity in our operations during the period 
second quarter in the second quarter  we reported a loss from operations of million  and a net loss of million  on revenue of million 
our operating ratio for the quarter was 
this second quarter loss resulted mainly from continuing start up expenses in our northwest region  additional purchased transportation expenses resulting from freight imbalances to and from the northwest and midwest regions  and delays in implementing planned operating improvement initiatives 
third quarter in the third quarter  we reported a loss from operations of million  and a net loss of million  on revenue of million 
our operating ratio for the quarter was 
the third quarter loss was due in large part to lower revenue  compared to the second quarter  as tonnage and yield declined 
increases in expenses relating to insurance and claims also contributed to the third quarter loss 
in an effort to align expenses with business volumes  during the third quarter we consolidated the operations of ten terminals into surrounding facilities that had excess capacity and converted an additional seven terminals into driver only locations 
this terminal consolidation resulted in reductions of employees by approximately full time and part time employees 
in addition  we opened a new door terminal in phoenix  arizona to replace an outdated and inefficient facility  and re engineered our linehaul system to gain efficiencies and to reduce purchased transportation expenses 
fourth quarter in the fourth quarter  we reported a loss from operations of million  and a net loss of million  on revenue of million 
our operating ratio for the quarter was 
despite lower revenue in the fourth quarter  compared to the third quarter of due in part to three less working days in the fourth quarter  we lowered our operating ratio by basis points 
insurance and claims and labor expenses improved as a percentage of revenue when compared to the third quarter  due in part to the initiatives taken in the third quarter described above 
at december   our balance sheet reflected million in unrestricted cash  million in restricted cash that served as collateral for letters of credit under our prior credit facility  million in long term debt and capital lease obligations  including current portion  and million in short term debt  of which million represented the cash collateral for letters of credit 
our stockholders equity was million at december  recent development on january   we entered into a four year senior collateralized revolving credit facility and letter of credit sub facility the new credit facility with bank of america  na  as agent  and certain other lenders from time to time party to the new credit facility 
the new credit facility replaces both our amended and restated revolving credit facility with suntrust bank  originally dated july   and our million revolving accounts receivable securitization facility with suntrust bank  originally dated april  subject to the terms of the new credit facility  the maximum revolving borrowing limit under the new credit facility is the lesser of a million  or b of borrower s eligible accounts receivable  plus of the net orderly liquidation value of borrower s eligible rolling stock owned as of january   plus of the cost of eligible rolling stock acquired by borrower after january  letters of credit under the new credit facility are subject to a sub limit of million 
the new credit facility terminates on january  borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at the base rate  as defined  plus an applicable margin of to  or libor plus an applicable margin of to  based on the average quarterly availability under the new credit facility 
letters of credit under the new credit facility are subject to an applicable letter of credit margin of to  based on the average quarterly availability under the new credit facility 
the new credit facility also prescribes additional fees for letter of credit transactions  and an unused line fee of to  based on aggregate amounts outstanding 
the new credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets  other than certain revenue equipment and real estate that is or may in the future become subject to other financing 
operating strategy for our main goals for are to achieve quarter by quarter sequential improvement in our operating performance and to return to profitability by the end of we believe the fourth quarter of was the first step in that direction  as our operating ratio improved basis points to from between the third and fourth quarters of we have identified five specific areas of focus in our efforts to improve results o improving revenue yield and total tonnage 
o reducing our cost structure to better align controllable costs with our expected revenue base 
o streamlining freight movements to consolidate movements and reduce the use of third party purchased transportation 
o improving employee efficiency 
o reducing insurance and claims expense 
we are encouraged by the fact that improvements were made in four of these five areas in the fourth quarter of  as compared to the third quarter of we believe that much work remains to be done to return our results to acceptable levels  particularly in the area of revenue yield and tonnage 
however  we believe the results for the fourth quarter of demonstrate measurable improvement 
achieving sequential improvement in the first quarter of will be difficult because of the seasonal effects on revenue and cost  but it remains our immediate goal 
revenues our revenues vary with the revenue per hundredweight we charge to customers and the volume of freight we transport o revenue per hundredweight measures the rates we receive from customers and varies with the type of goods being shipped and the distance these goods are transported 
our ltl revenue per hundredweight increased approximately from in  to in  due mainly to increases in fuel surcharge revenue 
our ltl revenue per hundredweight  without fuel surcharge revenue  declined to in from in o volume depends on the number of customers we have  the amount of freight those customers ship  geographic coverage  and the general economy 
our total tonnage decreased by from to  with a more dramatic decrease occurring during the second half of historically  most of our revenue has been generated from transporting ltl shipments from customers within our operating regions 
in  approximately of our revenue was derived from shipments that originated or terminated in regions outside our network  where a portion of the freight movement was handled by another carrier 
we refer to this as interline freight 
most of this revenue was obtained from carriers with which we maintain transportation alliances 
the revenue from interline freight in was lower compared to  due in large part to our geographic expansion 
because of the geographic expansion of our network  our need to rely upon other carriers for freight movements declined 
in addition  some of our relationships with carriers handling interline freight were negatively affected by our geographic expansion 
we do not recognize the portion of revenue or the associated expenses that relate to the portion of shipments hauled by our alliance partners 
in addition to transportation revenue  we also recognize revenue from fuel surcharges we receive from our customers when the national average diesel fuel price published by the us department of energy exceeds prices listed in our contracts and tariffs 
operating expenses our major expense categories can be summarized as follows salaries  wages  and benefits 
this category includes compensation for our employees  health insurance  workers compensation  k plan contributions  and other fringe benefits 
these expenses will vary depending upon several factors  including our efficiency  our experience with health and workers compensation claims  and increases in health care costs 
salaries  wages  and benefits also include the non cash expense associated with stock options granted to several of our executives that had exercise prices that were determined to be below fair market value 
this non cash compensation expense is expected to amount to approximately  annually through june of purchased transportation 
this category primarily consists of the payments we make to third parties to handle a portion of a freight movement for us 
the largest category is outsourced linehaul movements  where we contract with truckload carriers to move our freight between origin and destination terminals 
swift transportation  a related party  has been our largest provider of outsourced linehaul service 
purchased transportation also includes outsourced pick up and delivery service when we use alternative providers to service areas where we lack the terminal density to provide economical service 
operating and general supplies and expenses 
this category includes fuel  repairs and maintenance  tires  parts  general and administrative costs  office supplies  operating taxes and licenses  communications and utilities  and other general expenses 
repairs and maintenance  fuel  tires  and parts expenses vary with the age of equipment and the amount of usage 
we have a fuel surcharge program that enables us to recover a significant portion of fuel price increases 
insurance and claims 
this category includes the cost of insurance premiums and the accruals we make for claims within our self insured retention amounts  primarily for personal injury  property damage  physical damage to our equipment  and cargo claims 
these expenses will vary primarily based upon the frequency and severity of our accident experience and the market for insurance 
building and equipment rentals 
this category consists mainly of payments to unrelated third parties under terminal leases and payments to related parties for eight terminals leased under operating leases 
depreciation and amortization 
this category relates to owned assets  assets under capitalized leases  and properties we lease from southwest premier properties that are considered to be a financing arrangement 
unusual items affecting results during  we recorded an aggregate of million in increases to our insurance reserves for accident  workers compensation  and other liabilities arising prior to million of which related to two accidents that occurred in 
this compared to an accrual of million relating to claims that arose in prior periods in that we accrued in the year ended december  we recorded the increased accruals despite improvements in our rate of both accident claims and workers compensation claims during we also amended a benefit plan to reduce our future obligations 
as a result of this amendment  we recorded a curtailment gain of approximately million in in addition  in january of and  we increased the useful lives and decreased the salvage values of our tractors and trailers to reflect that we are operating the tractors and trailers for longer periods than previously estimated by our past management 
these changes decreased our depreciation expense by approximately million compared with the expense we would have recorded under the prior method 
in the aggregate  these items had a positive effect of approximately million on our operating income for the year ended december  we do not anticipate benefits similar to these in future periods 
discontinued operations of central refrigerated in  central refrigerated  a refrigerated truckload carrier  was formed to acquire certain assets from the bankruptcy estate of simon transportation services  inc  a refrigerated truckload carrier controlled by jerry moyes prior to the bankruptcy 
the goal was to obtain certain efficiencies for the refrigerated business  such as decreased insurance costs  in the period immediately following the acquisition 
the acquisition closed  and the operations of central refrigerated began  on april  we determined that it was advisable to divest central refrigerated in order to focus on our ltl growth strategy and devote our capital resources to our ltl operations 
effective december   ownership of central refrigerated was transferred to jerry moyes  our chairman  and one of his affiliates  and central refrigerated ceased to be our subsidiary 
since december   central refrigerated has continued to provide us with transportation services 
in the year ended december   central refrigerated provided us with approximately million of such services  representing approximately of the total amount paid by us for third party linehaul services in the period 
although central refrigerated is owned by jerry moyes  we believe that amounts paid by us to central refrigerated are equivalent to rates that could have been obtained in an arm s length transaction with an unrelated third party 
we expect our arrangements with central refrigerated for transportation services to continue  so long as its rates and service remain competitive with those offered by other carriers 
for additional information on our relationship with central refrigerated  see management compensation committee interlocks and participation in the definitive proxy statement to be delivered to our stockholders in connection with the annual meeting of stockholders to be held on may  separation payment to central refrigerated and repayment of moyes loans as part of the disposition of central refrigerated  we agreed to pay approximately million to central refrigerated to compensate central refrigerated and jerry moyes for facilitating the transaction 
this payment was made on october   and was reflected in our financial statements as an expense in our fourth fiscal quarter in following our payment of million to central refrigerated  mr 
moyes repaid approximately million in principal and interest due to us under loans we made to him prior to july  which were separate from and unrelated to our transactions with central refrigerated 
the loans to mr 
moyes had been recorded in our consolidated financial statements as a reduction of stockholders equity because of their related party nature and this reduction of equity was reversed with the repayment of the loan 
accordingly  taken together  our payment to central refrigerated and the loan repayment by mr 
moyes had no effect on our cash position and stockholders equity 
related party terminal leases we lease active terminals and seven dormant terminals from related parties 
the lease for most of these properties is accounted for as a financing arrangement in our consolidated financial statements  with the rental payments being reflected as interest 
the aggregate paid rent for these properties was approximately million in  million in and million in we believe the rent on certain of these properties had been below fair market value and agreed to increase the aggregate rent 
as a result of the rent increase  we have recognized approximately million annually in non cash interest expense in all periods prior to february   to reflect the rental of the affected properties at fair market value 
aggregate rent and non cash interest expense combined was approximately million in  million in and million in for all properties leased from related parties 
we are actively seeking to sublease or arrange for the sale of the dormant terminals 
for additional information on our related party terminal leases  see management compensation committee interlocks and insider participation in the definitive proxy statement to be delivered to our stockholders in connection with the annual meeting of stockholders to be held on may  s corporation status prior to november   we operated as an s corporation for federal income tax purposes 
an s corporation passes through essentially all taxable income and losses to its stockholders and does not pay federal income taxes at the corporate level 
for comparative purposes  we have included a pro forma provision for income taxes showing what those taxes would have been had we been taxed as a c corporation in all periods our s corporation election was in effect 
the provision for income taxes reflects the approximately million non cash charge for recognition of deferred federal income taxes to reflect our conversion from an s corporation to a c corporation on november  change in fiscal quarters our fiscal year ends on december from inception through december   our first three fiscal quarters consisted of weeks each  and our fourth fiscal quarter consisted of weeks 
commencing january   our year consists of four quarters  each with weeks 
this change in accounting periods will not affect the comparability of year end financial results 
the change will  however  affect comparisons of periods less than a full year 
each of our first three quarters in and beyond includes one additional week  and our fourth quarter in and beyond will include three fewer weeks  as compared to previous years 
results of operations the table below sets forth the percentage relationship of the specified items to operating revenues for the periods indicated

comparison of to operating revenues 
operating revenues decreased million  or  from million for to million for revenue per working day decreased from million in to million in the decrease in revenue per working day was attributable primarily to a decrease in ltl tonnage offset in part by an increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight from in to in this increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight was due mainly to an increase in fuel surcharge revenue per working day  as the cost of fuel increased in compared to ltl bills per working day decreased from to total tonnage decreased  tons  or  from  tons in to  tons in salaries  wages  and benefits 
salaries  wages  and benefits increased million  or  from million for to million for a substantial portion of this increase was attributable to the million curtailment gain recognized in that related to a reduction of our obligations under a benefit plan 
further  our group health expenses increased by million in  despite a decrease in the number of employees  while workers compensation expenses increased by million 
mileage based payments to linehaul drivers also increased by million from to  as our length of haul increased by to miles 
as a percentage of operating revenues  salaries  wages  and benefits increased from for  to for purchased transportation 
purchased transportation remained essentially constant at approximately million in both and however  purchased transportation paid to related parties decreased by million  which was offset by a similar increase in non related party purchased transportation 
we used third party contractors for a significant portion of our shipments 
as a percentage of operating revenues  purchased transportation increased from for to for operating and general supplies and expenses 
operating and general supplies and expenses increased million  or  from million for to million for the increase in operating and general supplies and expenses resulted primarily from increases in the cost of fuel  offset in part by an increase in fuel surcharge revenue 
the average price per gallon of diesel fuel was higher during as compared to also contributing to the increase in operating and general supplies and expenses were professional fees relating to our audit of internal controls under the sarbanes oxley act  increased property tax expense  increased provisions for doubtful accounts  and vehicle repair costs 
as a percentage of operating revenues  operating and general supplies and expenses increased from for to for insurance and claims 
insurance and claims increased million  or  from million for to million for the increase in insurance and claims expense resulted primarily from an increase in the number of cargo claims  an increase in insurance premiums and the approximate  settlement  in march of  for a lawsuit filed in all of which was expensed in the increase in insurance premiums was largely attributable to the cost of additional directors and officers insurance coverage 
the increase in insurance and claims expense also reflects our recording of a  expense in the third quarter in connection with the stockholder class action complaints 
the amount represents the entire deductible under our directors and officers insurance policy 
as a percentage of operating revenues  insurance and claims increased from for to for building and equipment rentals 
building and equipment rentals increased approximately million  or  from million for to million for the increase in building and equipment rentals resulted primarily from the addition of leased terminals in connection with our northwest expansion and the addition of a new terminal in california 
as a percentage of operating revenues  building and equipment rentals increased from for to for depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million  or  from million for to million for this increase was primarily attributable to equipment acquired in march in our northwest expansion and the addition of approximately other new and used tractors and new trailers added during the year 
as a percentage of operating revenues  depreciation and amortization increased from for to for operating ratio 
as a result of the foregoing  our operating ratio increased from for to for interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  from million for to million for as a percentage of operating revenues  interest expense decreased from for to for our average debt balances decreased from million in to million in due in large part to our payment of approximately million in december to reduce outstanding debt utilizing part of the net proceeds from our initial public offering 
during the second half of  we cash collateralized approximately million in letters of credit 
interest expense on this million borrowing was generally offset by interest income on the invested cash 
interest expense in included million of non cash interest expense attributable to a million annual increase in payments under related party terminal leases effective february  these payments were increased to fair value  and we recorded non cash interest expense in all prior periods to reflect the difference between the fair value rental and the former rental amount 
after february   the interest amounts reflect cash payments 
the amounts are recorded as interest because the leases are reflected as a financing arrangement in our consolidated financial statements 
income loss from continuing operations before income taxes was million for and million for pro forma income from continuing operations  assuming an effective tax rate of approximately in  amounted to million for compared to a net loss of million for our income tax benefit expenses changed from million for excluding the million expense for the establishment of federal deferred income taxes to million for the net tax benefit is net of a million valuation allowance established against our net deferred tax assets as of december  additionally  income taxes for included federal income tax expense for the last two periods of the year 
comparison of to operating revenues 
operating revenues increased million  or  from million for to million for revenue per working day increased from million in to million in the increase in revenue per working day was attributable primarily to a increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight from in to in and to an increase in fuel surcharge revenue per working day 
the overall increase in revenue per working day was partially offset by a decrease in total tonnage per working day 
as a result of yield improvement efforts  we eliminated less profitable freight and  where possible  replaced it with more profitable loads 
total tonnage decreased  tons  or  from  tons in to  tons in our midwest expansion also contributed to our overall increase in revenues 
salaries  wages  and benefits 
salaries  wages  and benefits decreased million  or  from million for to million for due mainly to a million gain relating to a reduction of our obligations under a benefit plan 
without this reduction  salaries  wages and benefits would have amounted to million 
the resultant increase in salaries  wages  and benefits resulted primarily from an increase in compensation for most of our employees  rising medical costs  the costs of additional sales personnel  and the costs of additional employees and relocation expenses incurred in connection with our midwest expansion 
in addition to these factors  salaries  wages  and benefits expense for also included a million increase to our workers compensation reserves for claims that arose prior to  compared with a million increase to such reserves for prior period claims recorded in these factors partially offset a decrease in the total number of employees resulting from our management initiatives 
as a percentage of operating revenues  salaries  wages  and benefits decreased from for  to for purchased transportation 
purchased transportation increased million  or  from million for to million for the increase in purchased transportation resulted primarily from an increase in our midwest expansion 
because of the geographic breadth and lane characteristics of that particular expansion effort  we used third party contractors for a significant portion of our shipments 
our use of contractors in the midwest decreased beginning in the third quarter of as a percentage of operating revenues  purchased transportation increased from for to for operating and general supplies and expenses 
operating and general supplies and expenses increased million  or  from million for to million for the increase in operating and general supplies and expenses resulted primarily from an increase in the cost of fuel and vehicle repairs 
as a percentage of operating revenues  operating and general supplies and expenses increased from for to for  primarily because the average price per gallon of diesel fuel was higher during as compared to insurance and claims 
insurance and claims increased million  or  from million for to million for the increase in insurance and claims expense resulted primarily from an increase in the accrual of million in estimated liabilities for claims that arose prior to million of which related to two accidents in  compared with no increase in such reserves for prior period claims recorded in the period 
as a percentage of operating revenues  insurance and claims increased from for to for building and equipment rentals 
building and equipment rentals increased approximately million  or  from million for to million for the increase in building and equipment rentals resulted primarily from the addition of leased terminals in connection with our midwest expansion 
as a percentage of operating revenues  building and equipment rentals decreased slightly from for to for depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately million  or  from million for to million for  as a result of a change in the estimated useful lives and sales of our revenue equipment 
in january  we increased useful lives of trailers from twelve to fifteen years and reduced salvage values from to 
we also increased useful lives of line tractors from seven to ten years and reduced salvage values on pick up and delivery and line tractors from to 
these changes were made to reflect the fact that we are currently operating these tractors for longer periods of time than previously estimated by our past management 
the changes reduced depreciation expense by approximately million in as a percentage of operating revenues  depreciation and amortization decreased from for to for operating ratio 
as a result of the foregoing  our operating ratio improved from for to for interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  from million for to million for as a percentage of operating revenues  interest expense decreased from for to for our average debt balances decreased from million in to million in due in large part to our payment of approximately million in december to reduce outstanding debt utilizing part of the net proceeds from our initial public offering  and our average non related party interest rates decreased from in the to in includes million and includes million of non cash interest expense attributable to a million annual increase in payments under related party terminal leases effective february  income from continuing operations before income taxes was million for and million for pro forma income from continuing operations  assuming an effective tax rate of approximately in each period  improved from million for to million for our income taxes changed from a net tax benefit of million for to a net tax expense of million for excluding the million expense for establishment of federal deferred income taxes primarily due to the reversal of a million reserve for the contingent expense that could have resulted from any tax assessments related to our election of s corporation tax status in during the fiscal quarter ended june   we determined that this reserve was no longer necessary because the allowable period for a tax assessment had ended 
liquidity and capital resources our business has required substantial  ongoing capital investments  particularly to replace revenue equipment such as tractors and trailers 
our primary sources of liquidity have historically been cash from operations  secured borrowings  and proceeds of our initial public offering 
during our net capital expenditure requirements are expected to be only million to million  as our tractor and trailer fleets are at average ages that do not require substantial replacements and we do not expect to purchase any terminals 
our net capital expenditure expectations include roughly million for replacement of revenue equipment and selling our former phoenix location 
if we decide not to replace revenue equipment and are successful in selling the former phoenix facility  our net capital expenditures may be close to zero for we do not believe a substantial increase in net capital expenditures over the million to million level assumed for will be required in at december   we had approximately million in stockholders equity and in long term debt  including current maturities 
under our new credit facility described under recent development above  we had an average of approximately million of availability during the first three weeks of march in addition to the availability under our new credit facility  we have approximately million cost basis in active terminals that we are able to use in one or more sale leaseback or borrowing transactions  and we have approximately million in assets  primarily real estate  held for sale 
management is presently pursuing financing alternatives involving the active terminals and is attempting to sell the assets held for sale 
although we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful  we expect to gain significant additional liquidity from these assets 
our discussion above concerning net capital expenditures does not take into account any proceeds from a potential sale leaseback of our terminals 
although there can be no assurance  we believe cash from operations  borrowing available under our new credit facility  and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the end of to the extent that actual results or events differ from management s financial projections or business plans  our liquidity may be adversely affected and we may be unable to meet our financial covenants 
specifically  our liquidity may be adversely affected by one or more of the following factors weak freight demand or a loss in customer relationships or volume  our success in executing management s turnaround steps described above  our ability to improve the collection of our accounts receivable  elevated fuel prices and the ability to collect fuel surcharges  costs associated with insurance and claims  an inability to maintain compliance with  or negotiate amendments to  loan covenants  the ability to finance tractors and trailers  and the possibility of shortened payment terms by our suppliers and vendors worried about our ability to meet payment obligations 
we are currently executing a turnaround plan that is designed to reverse recent negative cash flows 
during and into early we have experienced a period of negative cash flow attributable primarily to operating losses and approximately in acquisitions of revenue equipment during during the third and fourth quarters of  our management began implementing several steps that are intended to improve our operating results and maintain compliance with our financial covenants 
these steps include reducing our cost structure to better align controllable costs with our expected revenue base  streamlining freight movements to consolidate movements and reduce the use of third party purchased transportation  improving employee efficiency  reducing insurance and claims expense  and improving revenue yield and total tonnage 
these steps contributed to a basis point improvement in our operating ratio between the third quarter of when the steps were implemented and the fourth quarter of we expect additional improvement in our operating ratio between the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of although our management believes that these actions should generate the required improvements  there can be no assurance that the improvements will occur as planned 
our ability to fund our cash requirements in future periods will depend on our ability to improve operating results and cash flow and our ability to comply with covenants contained in our financing arrangements 
our ability to achieve required improvements will depend on general shipping demand by our customers  insurance and claims expense  and other factors 
on january   we entered into our new credit facility with bank of america and others that replaced the securitization facility and the amended and restated revolving facility 
see recent development above for additional information 
the new credit facility contains certain restrictions and covenants relating to  among other things  fixed charge coverage ratio  cash flow  capital expenditures  acquisitions and dispositions  sale leaseback transactions  additional indebtedness  additional liens  dividends and distributions  investment transactions  and transactions with affiliates 
the new credit facility includes usual and customary events of default for a facility of this nature and provides that  upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default  payment of all amounts payable under the new credit facility may be accelerated  and the lenders commitments may be terminated 
net cash used in provided by operating activities was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash  provided by operating activities  from to million  resulted mainly from million in reduced cash as a result of a larger cash loss from operations offset by an million increase in trade accounts payable in  compared to a million decrease in trade accounts payable in  and a million increase in accounts receivable in  compared to a million increase in the average age of our accounts receivable was days for the year ended december   days for the year ended december   and days for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these expenditures were financed with long term debt and cash flows from operations 
our capital expenditures were approximately million in mainly for revenue equipment and two new terminals  million in  and million in we also paid million in for certain assets related to our northwest expansion 
our budget for net capital expenditures  giving effect to any offset from sales or trades of equipment  is expected to range between and million in we expect our capital expenditures to consist primarily of the acquisition of new tractors and trailers 
we expect to pay for the projected capital expenditures with borrowings under our credit facilities  borrowings under capital leases and cash flows from operations 
our capital expenditure budget excludes the effect of any acquisitions 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in july  as a condition for amending our credit facility we agreed to place million in a restricted cash account 
this fund was established through a borrowing under our securitization facility 
the restricted cash fund was established to cash collateralize an equal amount of letters of credit 
other funds provided by financing activities in arose mainly from borrowings under our securitization facility while in they were mainly derived from the million net proceeds from our initial public offering in december  at december   we had outstanding long term obligations of approximately million 
the following chart reflects the outstanding amounts by category capital lease obligations 
million total long term debt million related party financing million total million on april   we entered into a million revolving accounts receivable securitization facility the securitization facility that was set to expire on april  under the securitization facility  we sell  on a revolving basis  our interests in accounts receivable to central receivables  a wholly owned  special purpose subsidiary 
the assets and liabilities of central receivables are included in our consolidated financial statements 
the securitization facility allowed us to receive up to million of proceeds  subject to eligible receivables and pay a service fee recorded as interest expense  as defined in the agreement 
we were required to pay commercial paper interest rates plus an applicable margin on the proceeds received 
interest was generally payable monthly 
the securitization facility included certain restrictions and financial covenants 
we were required to pay a commitment fee equal to per annum of of the facility limit minus the aggregate principal balance  as well as an administrative fee equal to per annum of the uncommitted balance 
as of december  there were borrowings of million and at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the securitization facility 
on july   we entered into a million amended and restated revolving credit facility with suntrust bank the amended and restated revolving facility 
on november   we executed a first amendment to the amended and restated revolving credit facility 
under the first amendment to the amended and restated revolving facility  we could receive up to an aggregate of million of proceeds in the form of letters of credit  only 
the amended and restated revolving facility accrued interest at a variable rate equal  at our option  to either a the bank s prime lending rate minus an applicable margin  or b libor plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margins for both types of loans varied depending on our lease adjusted leverage ratio 
interest was payable in periods from one to three months at our option 
the amended and restated revolving facility was collateralized by certain revenue equipment  and letters of credit that were issued were collateralized by cash collateral 
the facility contained  among other things  certain financial and non financial covenants  and was set to mature on april  we were required to pay a commitment fee equal to per annum on the daily unused amended and restated revolving facility as well as a letter of credit fee equal to per annum on the average daily amount of the letters of credit 
we were also required to cash collateralize our outstanding letters of credit 
at december   we had restricted cash of million  as reported on our consolidated balance sheet related to these letters of credit 
at december   we had letters of credit of million outstanding and available under the amended and restated revolving facility 
on january   we entered into our new credit facility with bank of america and others that replaced the securitization facility and the amended and restated revolving facility 
in march  we acquired certain assets of eoff for approximately million 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid approximately million of the purchase price at closing  million in the second quarter of  million in the third quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of the remaining million is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as short term notes payable at december  and is expected to be paid or liquidated prior to the end of our first quarter 
in  we entered into an agreement with southwest premier properties llc  for the sale and leaseback of the land  structures  and improvements of terminal properties and one additional property in waco  texas 
the sale price for the properties was approximately million in for financial accounting purposes  the lease for these properties is accounted for in our consolidated financial statements as a financing arrangement 
consequently  the related land  structures  and improvements remain on our consolidated balance sheet 
the annual lease payments are reflected as a cost of the financing and recorded as interest expense 
in february  the lease covering these properties was extended to february  with further options through in addition  the annual rental amount on active terminal properties was adjusted to reflect agreed market values 
the annual rental amount was increased from million to million 
we have recognized approximately million annually in non cash interest expense in all periods prior to february in the accompanying financial statements to reflect the rental of the affected properties at the increased values 
the rent will be adjusted upward after five years to reflect any increase in interest rates between february and february the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands less than after total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations      related party real estate financing   operating lease obligations

consequently  each purchase of financed revenue equipment decreases working capital 
we had a working capital surplus of million at december   million at december  and million at december  off balance sheet arrangements certain of our terminals are financed off balance sheet through operating leases 
as of december   of our terminals  including seven owned by related parties  were subject to operating leases 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents our unaudited operating results for the eight quarters ended december  in our opinion  all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the quarterly results when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes  which are included elsewhere in this annual report

accordingly  income tax expenses recorded by us reflect state income taxes 
pro forma net loss income has been adjusted to reflect the application of federal income taxes 
on november  we elected c corporation status for federal income taxes and recorded million federal deferred taxes upon conversion 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a million gain as a result of amendments made to a benefit plan 
in the second quarter of  we recorded a million increase in our claims accrual related to accident  workers compensation  and other claims including million related to two accidents that occurred in in which the underlying events occurred prior to in the third quarter of  we recorded a million gain as a result of further amendments made to the benefit plan referenced above 
in  we recorded reduced depreciation expense as a result of additional changes in useful lives and salvage values of trailers and line tractors of  in each of the quarters 
these changes in useful lives and salvage values were made based on our historical experience 
on november  we elected c corporation status for federal income taxes 
in the fourth quarter  we recognized a loss from discontinued operations of million which along with the million income tax expense from converting to c corporation status was primarily responsible for the million net loss from continuing operations for the quarter 
during  the irs disallowed certain tax deductions taken by the s corporation shareholders pursuant to a contested liability trust 
as a result of the disallowance of such deductions  the c corporation s tax basis was increased resulting in a deferred tax benefit of million 
during  we analyzed our deferred tax assets and liabilities and determined that  under current accounting treatment  a valuation allowance of million was applicable to our net deferred tax assets 
critical accounting policies we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financials statements 
revenue recognition 
operating revenue is recognized upon delivery of the related freight  as is fuel surcharge revenue 
in  approximately of our revenue was derived from interline shipments 
most of this revenue was with carriers with which we maintain transportation alliances 
we do not recognize revenue or the associated expenses that relates to the portion of the shipment transported by our alliance partners 
insurance and claims accruals 
we record insurance and claims accruals based upon our estimate of the ultimate total cost of claims  not covered by insurance  for bodily injury and property damage  cargo loss and damage  physical damage to our equipment  workers compensation  long term disability  and group health  and post retirement health benefits 
our estimates are based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of the claims and our past claims experience 
we include an estimate for incurred but not reported claims 
the estimated costs for bodily injury and property damage  cargo loss and damage  and physical damage to our equipment are charged to insurance and claims 
the other estimated costs are charged to employee benefits expense 
from june  to june   our self insured retention for bodily injury and property damage  cargo loss and damage  and physical damage to our equipment was an aggregate million per occurrence 
effective june   we increased our self insured retention to million per occurrence  on october  reduced our self insured retention to million per occurrence and on january  increased our self insured retention to million 
our self insured retention for workers compensation has been million per occurrence since october  we also self insure for all health claims up to million per occurrence 
we expect our claims reserves to increase in future periods as a result of our higher self insured retention 
in october  we were forced to seek replacement excess insurance coverage after our insurance agent failed to produce proof of insurance on policies for which we had obtained binders as of july  we are not aware of any claims during the period between july and october that are expected to exceed the self insured retention level we had at the time 
for any claims arising during such period  that would exceed that level  we intend to pursue our legal rights against the insurance agent and its errors and omissions policy but we cannot assure you that such coverage will be available  in which case our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue adjustments 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue adjustments 
such allowances represent our estimate of accounts that will not ultimately be collected and correspondingly adjust our operating revenues to reflect the estimates of noncollectible accounts 
estimates used in determining this allowance are based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy  and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in years in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed 
under sfas no 
and applicable interpretations  if all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as state tax credit carry forwards or state net operating loss carry forwards  are determined not to be realizable  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of such deferred tax assets 
in  based on our results of operations and existing accounting interpretations that do not allow us to consider future expectations  only past results  we established a million valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
despite the requirement for such allowance  we believe that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income 
the determination of the combined tax rate used to calculate our provision for income taxes for both current and deferred income taxes also requires significant judgment by management 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that the net deferred tax asset or liability be valued using enacted tax rates that we believe will be in effect when these temporary differences reverse 
we use the combined tax rates in effect at the time the financial statements are prepared since no better information is available 
if changes in the federal statutory rate or significant changes in the statutory state and local tax rates occur prior to or during the reversal of these items or if our filing obligations were to change materially  this could change the combined rate and  by extension  our provision for income taxes 
goodwill 
our business acquisitions have resulted in goodwill  which may become impaired in the future 
as of december   our goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  was million 
we perform our goodwill impairment tests annually and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that impairment may have occurred occurred 
a drop in our market value could result in an impairment charge of all or a portion of our goodwill 
based on our current market value  it is possible that a non cash impairment charge of all or a portion of our goodwill will occur in the first quarter of inflation most of our expenses are affected by inflation  which generally results in increased operating costs 
in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products  particularly diesel fuel  we have implemented a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements 
the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of fuel above a base price and increases as fuel prices escalate over the base 
we do not expect the net effect of inflation on our results of operations to be different from the effect on ltl carriers generally 
seasonality we experience some seasonal fluctuations in freight volume 
historically  our shipments decrease during winter months and our operating expenses have been higher in the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs for our tractors and trailers in colder weather 
our southern operating region has lessened the seasonal impact of colder weather to some extent 
our expansion into the midwest and planned expansion into the northwest may increase our exposure to seasonal fluctuations in operating expenses 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb revised sfas no

factors that may affect future results our future results may be affected by a number of factors over which we have little or no control 
the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our business and growth outlook 
we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability 
numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to achieve profitability 
these factors include the following o we compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes  some of which have more equipment  a broader coverage network  a wider range of services  and greater capital resources than we do or have other competitive advantages 
o some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business  especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy  which may limit our ability to maintain or increase prices or maintain significant growth in our business 
o some of our competitors have begun offering customers a money back guarantee if certain shipments are delivered late  and we have not yet evaluated the effect of such product offerings on the marketplace or the possible effects on our financial condition 
o many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so called core carriers as approved transportation service providers  and in some instances we may not be selected 
o many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs  and this process may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors 
o the trend towards consolidation in the ground transportation industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources than us and other competitive advantages relating to their size 
o advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive  and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments 
o competition from non asset based logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and prices 
o competitors that  in the past  have used us to deliver interline shipments for them in our regions may not continue to do so  which would reduce our revenue 
we have a limited operating history as an independent company and experienced net losses during  and we began our operations on june   after acquiring the name central freight lines and substantially all of the operating assets of the southwestern division of viking freight system 
thus  our operating history is brief and provides a limited basis for evaluating our performance 
further  we experienced a net loss of approximately million in and million in although we generated income from continuing operations of approximately million and million in and  respectively  we experienced a loss from continuing operations of approximately million in although we have identified certain steps designed to return the company to profitability by the end of  we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or that we will again achieve profitability 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will not experience net losses in the future 
if we are unable to make planned improvements in our operations  the value of stockholders investments may suffer 
further  there can be no assurance as to our ability to generate positive cash flow in future periods 
if we are unable to generate positive cash flow in the future  we may not be able to satisfy contractual obligations or fund our working capital needs 
our business is subject to general economic and business factors over which we have little or no control 
our business is affected by a number of factors that may have a materially adverse effect on the results of our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include o significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices 
o excess capacity in the trucking industry 
o decline in the resale value of used equipment 
o fluctuations in interest rates 
o rising healthcare costs 
o higher fuel taxes and license and registration fees 
o increases in insurance costs or liability claims 
o difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers 
we also are affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries  such as retail  where we have a significant concentration of customers 
economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay for our services 
customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
a significant amount of our freight is concentrated in texas and california 
accordingly  we also are directly impacted by economic conditions in and affecting texas and california over which we have no control 
if we are unable to successfully execute our operating strategy  our business and future results of operations may suffer 
as part of our operating strategy for the immediate future  we have identified five specific areas of focus in our efforts to improve operating results reducing our cost structure to better align controllable costs with our expected revenue base  streamlining freight movements to consolidate movements and reduce the use of third party purchased transportation  improving employee efficiency  reducing insurance and claims expense  and improving revenue yield and total tonnage 
this business strategy is subject to a number of risks  which include the following o revenue growth may be delayed or not occur at all 
o improvements in revenue yield and tonnage growth may be delayed or not occur at all 
o our service  safety  and productivity measures may be further delayed or not be successfully implemented throughout our operations 
o our cost cutting measures may have unintended and unforeseen consequences that adversely affect our business 
o our insurance and claims costs may continue to exceed our expectations and may not return to acceptable levels on a timely basis or at all 
if these risks materialize  or if our efforts to improve performance are otherwise unsuccessful  our business  financial condition  and results of operations will suffer 
we may not be able to successfully manage our growth or integrate acquisitions  which could cause our business to suffer 
in december  we expanded our ltl service in a seven state region in the midwest 
in march  we expanded our business further to serve a three state region in the northwest through the acquisition of the terminal network and selected assets of eoff 
we cannot assure you that our midwest expansion or our northwest expansion will be successful 
further  in connection with our growth generally  we may need to purchase additional equipment  add new terminals  hire additional personnel  and increase our marketing efforts 
our growth exposes us to a number of risks  including the following o our geographic expansion has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our existing transportation alliances with carriers in those regions 
o our geographic expansion has produced and may continue to produce freight imbalances  customer service issues  operational issues  or other consequences that we cannot manage successfully on a timely basis or at all 
o our growth has strained and may continue to strain our management  capital resources  and computer and other systems 
we cannot assure you that we will overcome the risks associated with the growth of our company 
we have significant ongoing capital requirements that could adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations 
the ltl industry is capital intensive 
historically  we have depended on cash from operations  proceeds from our accounts receivable securitization  borrowing from banks and finance companies  and leases to expand the size of our terminal network and maintain and expand our fleet of revenue equipment 
we are projecting continuing expenditures for tractors and trailers in and beyond  primarily due to the need to replace older equipment in the fleet and increased costs of new tractors following the october implementation of new emissions control regulations 
our budget for capital expenditures  giving effect to any offsets from sales or trades of equipment  will range from to million for if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain financing on favorable terms in the future  we may have to limit our growth  enter into less favorable financing arrangements  or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods  any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability 
if we are unable to retain our key employees  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be harmed 
we are highly dependent upon the services of the following key employees robert v 
fasso  our chief executive officer and president  jeffrey a 
hale  our senior vice president and chief financial officer  and walt ainsworth  our executive vice president 
the loss of any of their services could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and future profitability 
we must continue to develop and retain a core group of managers if we are to realize our goal of expanding our operations and continuing our growth 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
our ability to compete would be substantially impaired if our employees were to unionize 
none of our employees are represented under a collective bargaining agreement by a labor union 
in  the international brotherhood of teamsters filed a petition with the national labor relations board seeking an election among the employees at our dallas  texas facility 
our employees voted not to form a union when that election was conducted in april in october  after we requested an election  the teamsters withdrew from representing our employees in las vegas  our only remaining facility where employees had at one time requested union representation 
while we believe our current relationship with our employees is good  we cannot assure you that further unionization efforts will not occur in the future 
our non union status is a critical factor in our ability to compete 
if our employees vote to join a union and we sign a collective bargaining agreement  the results probably would be adverse for several reasons o some shippers have indicated that they intend to limit their use of unionized trucking companies because of the threat of strikes and other work stoppages 
a loss of customers would impair our revenue base 
o restrictive work rules could hamper our efforts to improve and sustain operating efficiency  for example by inhibiting our ability to implement dynamic resource planning within our workplace 
o a strike or work stoppage would hurt our profitability and could damage customer and other relationships 
o an election and bargaining process would distract management s time and attention and impose significant expenses 
these results  and unionization of our workforce generally  could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial position  and results of operations 
ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly affect our operations 
our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels  which could reduce our earnings 
we currently carry million of insurance coverage  with a self insured retention of million per occurrence for claims resulting from cargo theft or loss  personal injury  property damage  and physical damage to our equipment 
we also self insure for workers compensation up to million per occurrence  and for all health claims up to million 
insurance carriers have raised premiums for most trucking companies 
additional increases could further increase our insurance and claims expense as current coverages expire or cause us to raise our self insured retention 
if the number or severity of claims for which we are self insured increases  we suffer adverse development in claims compared with our reserves  or any claim exceeds the limits of our insurance coverage  our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
our large self insured retentions require us to make estimates of ultimate loss amounts and accrue such estimates as expenses 
changes in estimates may materially and adversely affect our financial results 
in  we recorded an aggregate of million in increases to our reserves for accident  workers compensation  and other liabilities arising in prior periods 
such accrual included million for two accidents that occurred in this compared to an accrual of million in additional expense in  relating to claims that arose in prior periods 
the large accrual in caused our financial results to suffer 
we may be required to accrue such additional expenses in the future 
in october  we were forced to seek replacement excess insurance coverage after our insurance agent failed to produce proof of insurance on policies for which we had obtained binders as of july  we are not aware of any claims during the period between july and october that are expected to exceed the self insured retention level we had at the time 
for any claims arising during such period that exceed that level  we intend to pursue our legal rights against the insurance agent and its errors and omissions policy but we cannot assure you that such coverage will be available  in which case our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
ongoing insurance requirements could constrain our borrowing capacity 
our ability to incur additional indebtedness could be adversely affected by an increase in requirements that we post letters of credit in support of our insurance policies 
on january   we entered into our new credit facility with bank of america  na  as agent  and certain other lenders 
as of march   million in borrowings and million in letters of credit were outstanding 
available borrowings under the new credit facility as of that date were million 
the face amount of letters of credit we are required to post is expected to increase in the future 
increases in letters of credit outstanding will reduce our borrowing capacity under the new credit facility  thereby adversely affecting our liquidity 
difficulty in attracting qualified drivers could adversely affect our profitability and ability to grow 
periodically  the trucking industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers  including independent contractors 
if we are unable to attract drivers and contract with independent contractors  we could be required to adjust our compensation package  let trucks sit idle  or operate with fewer independent contractors and face difficulty meeting shipper demands  all of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 
fluctuations in the price or availability of fuel and our ability to collect fuel surcharges may affect our costs of operation 
we require large amounts of diesel fuel to operate our tractors 
diesel fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to economic  political  and other factors beyond our control 
for example  diesel fuel prices recently reached historically high levels average price per gallon in october  with our cost averaging per gallon for  compared with per gallon for to address fluctuations in fuel prices  we seek to impose fuel surcharges on our accounts 
these arrangements will not fully protect us from fuel price increases 
in addition  any shortage or interruption in the supply of fuel would negatively affect us 
accordingly  fluctuations in fuel prices  or a shortage of diesel fuel  could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we base our fuel surcharge rates on the weekly national average price of diesel fuel 
because our operations are concentrated in the southwestern united states  there is some risk that the national average will not fully reflect regional fuel prices  particularly in california 
historically  we have not engaged in hedging transactions to protect us from fluctuations in fuel prices 
we rely on transportation alliances with other ltl operators  and a breakdown of these alliances could adversely affect our revenues 
in our regional ltl operations  we primarily pick up and deliver freight within our own operating regions 
freight originating outside our territory for delivery inside our territory is brought to us by several other trucking companies with which we have formed transportation alliances 
in return  we deliver to them freight that originates in our territory for delivery in their territories 
in  transportation alliances generated approximately of our revenue 
these alliances subject us to certain risks  including o expanding our own operations into an alliance company s territory may cause that company to stop using our alliance 
o we may not control the customer relationship on freight moving into our territory 
o our alliance companies can end their relationships with us at any time and could choose to form an alliance with one of our competitors in our territory 
o the reduction or termination of our alliances could negatively impact our business and results of operations 
our chairman  jerry moyes  his family  and trusts for the benefit of his family own approximately of our stock and have substantial control over us 
jerry moyes and trusts for the benefit of his family beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  mr 
moyes brother and sister in law  ronald and krista moyes  beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
mr 
jerry moyes  his family  and certain trusts for the benefit of his family are able to influence decisions requiring stockholder approval  including election of our board of directors  our management and policies  the adoption or extension of anti takeover provisions  mergers  and other business combinations 
this concentration of ownership may allow mr 
jerry moyes to prevent or delay a change of control of our company or an amendment to our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws 
in matters requiring stockholder approval  mr 
jerry moyes interests may differ from the interests of other holders of our common stock and he may take actions affecting us with which you may disagree 
we engage in transactions with other businesses controlled by our officers and directors  and the interests of our officers and directors could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders 
we engage in multiple transactions with related parties 
these transactions include the lease of active terminals and seven dormant terminals from southwest premier properties  llc southwest premier is owned by some of our existing stockholders  including jerry moyes  our chairman of the board  robert v 
fasso  our chief executive officer and patrick j 
curry  our former executive vice president 
these related party transactions also include the lease of two active terminals from jerry moyes  the lease of two terminals from swift transportation  the lease of independent contractor drivers and their tractors from interstate equipment leasing  inc  and freight transportation transactions with swift transportation and central refrigerated  companies for which jerry moyes serves as chairman 
as a result  our directors and executive officers may have interests that conflict with yours 
although we have adopted a policy requiring that all future transactions with affiliated parties be approved by our audit committee or another committee of disinterested directors  we cannot assure you that the policy will be successful in eliminating conflicts of interests 
the loss of one or more of our five largest customers could significantly and adversely affect our cash flow  market share  and profits 
in  our largest customer  dell computer  accounted for approximately of our total revenues  and our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
our largest customers are under no firm obligation to ship with us and the contracts are generally terminable upon or days notice 
in addition  we have significant exposure to the retail sector and to the economies in texas and california 
if we lose one or more of our large customers  or if there is a decline in the amount of services those customers purchase from us  our cash flow  market share  and profits could be adversely affected 
our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions 
our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry  particularly as customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday 
harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand  impeding our ability to transport freight  and increasing operating expenses 
we are party to securities class action and derivative litigation which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 
in june and july  three stockholder class actions were filed against us and certain of our officers and directors 
the class actions were filed in the united states district court western district of texas and generally allege that false and misleading statements were made in our initial public offering registration statement and prospectus  during the period surrounding our initial pubic offering  and up to the press release dated june  the class actions are in the initial phases and we intend to vigorously defend against the suits 
on august and   two purported derivative actions were filed against us  as nominal defendant  and against certain of our officers  directors  and former directors 
these actions were filed in the district court of mclennan county  texas and generally allege breach of fiduciary duty  abuse of control  gross mismanagement  waste of corporate assets  and unjust enrichment on the part of certain of our present and former officers and directors in the period between december  and august the purported derivative actions seek declaratory  injunctive  and other relief 
we cannot provide any assurances as to the outcome of this litigation 
any conclusion of this litigation in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  the cost to us of defending the litigation  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
such litigation could also divert the attention of our management and our resources in general 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of this litigation also could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with  or liability for violation of  existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
our operations are regulated and licensed by various us agencies 
our drivers also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the united states department of transportation  or dot  including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service 
such matters as weight and equipment dimensions are also subject to us regulations 
we also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions  drivers hours of service  ergonomics  or other matters affecting safety or operating methods 
future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in our operating practices  influence the demand for transportation services  or require us to incur significant additional costs 
higher costs incurred by us or by our suppliers who pass the costs onto us through higher prices would adversely affect our results of operations 
beginning in  motor carriers were required to comply with several changes to dot hours of service requirements that may have a positive or negative effect on driver hours and miles and our operations 
a citizens advocacy group successfully petitioned the courts that the new rules were developed without driver health in mind 
pending further action by the courts or the effectiveness of new rules addressing these issues  congress has enacted a law that extends the effectiveness of the new rules until september  we cannot predict whether there will be changes to the hours of service rules  the extent of any changes  or whether there will be further court challenges 
given this uncertainty  we are unable to determine the future effect of driver hour regulations on our operations 
the dot is also considering implementing higher safety requirements on trucks 
these regulatory changes may have an adverse affect on our future profitability 
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling and handling of hazardous materials  fuel storage tanks  air emissions from our vehicles and facilities  and discharge and retention of stormwater 
we operate in industrial areas  where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located  and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred 
our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage  environmental damage  and hazardous waste disposal  among others 
we also maintain bulk fuel storage tanks and fueling islands at nineteen of our facilities 
a small percentage of our freight consists of low grade hazardous substances  such as paint  which subjects us to a wide array of regulations 
if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances  if there are releases of hazardous substances we transport  or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  we could be subject to liabilities that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  most importantly the effects of the price and availability of diesel fuel and changes in interest rates 
to address the risk of high fuel prices  we maintain a fuel surcharge program 
fuel surcharge programs are well established in the industry and are broadly accepted by our customers 
we believe our fuel surcharge program is effective at mitigating the risk of high fuel prices 
accordingly  we have not engaged in any fuel price hedging activities 
because fuel surcharges are based on the weekly national average price of diesel fuel and our operations are concentrated in the southwest  there is some risk that the national average will not fully reflect regional fuel prices  particularly in california 
we are highly dependent on adequate supplies of diesel fuel 
if our supply were interrupted  for example as a result of war or hostile action against the united states or in fuel producing regions  we would be exposed to significant risks 
our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates 
historically  we have used a combination of fixed rate and variable rate obligations to manage our interest rate exposure 
fixed rate obligations expose us to the risk that interest rates might fall 
variable rate obligations expose us to the risk that interest rates might rise 
we did not have any interest rate swaps at december   although we may enter into such swaps in the future if we deem appropriate 
our variable rate obligations consist of our revolving line of credit and our accounts receivable securitization facility 
our revolving line of credit  provided there has been no default  carries a variable interest rate based on either the prime rate or libor 
our securitization facility carries a variable interest rate based on the commercial paper rate 
assuming borrowings equal to the million available on the securitization facility at december   a one percentage point increase in commercial paper rates would increase our annual interest expense by
