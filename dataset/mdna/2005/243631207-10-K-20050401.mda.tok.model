item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company provides interior furnishings to original equipment manufacturers of manufactured housing and recreational vehicles and to the hospitality market 
this interior furnishing market is highly competitive 
the company faces risk as the demand for its products is affected by the industry demand in the three markets that the company serves 
any significant decline in the demand for manufactured housing  recreational vehicles  or hospitality accommodations can adversely affect the company s results of operations or financial condition 
a large amount of the company s sales are to a relatively few recreational vehicle and manufactured housing customers 
in  the company s top customers accounted for approximately of net sales 
the loss of a large customer can have a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
in  with the completion of a supply agreement with fleetwood enterprises  the company is under contract to be the exclusive supplier of fleetwood s interior furnishings through at least january fleetwood represented approximately of the company s net sales in fleetwood operates in both the recreational vehicle and manufactured housing industries 
in august  the company purchased a facility in phoenix  arizona to manufacture product for customers located in the western united states 
this facility will enable the company to better supply fleetwood s west coast operations and also to solicit new customers 
the company faces the risk that its furnishings could be provided by companies with cheaper labor sources  such as from asian sources 
however  the lack of sufficient lead times from its customers  as well as the customized nature of many of the company s products  presents a substantial barrier to entry for overseas firms 
the recreational vehicle market has exhibited strong performance over the past few years 
total industry shipments of motor homes and travel trailers have increased from  in to  in the company s sales to this market have increased accordingly 
the manufactured housing market has experienced declining production since most recent peak shipments of  units in industry shipments in were about  virtually flat compared to the  shipments in in  the company s sales to the manufactured housing industry rose  due to the additional business from the fleetwood supply contract 
sales to the hospitality industry increased about during when compared to the previous year 
hospitality sales are affected by demand for hospitality accommodations and the growth of the industry 
sales by market the following table represents net sales to each of the three different markets that the company serves for the three fiscal years ended january  dollars in thousands net of net of net of sales total sales total sales total recreational vehicle    manufactured housing    hospitality    total net sales    critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments the company uses in applying its accounting policies have a significant impact on the results it reports in the financial statements 
some of the accounting policies require it to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the most critical accounting estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable and inventory 
the company reviews its accounts receivable portfolio frequently  assessing any past due accounts for collectability 
physical inventory is conducted at each of the company s manufacturing facilities at least quarterly  and inventories are assessed for any slow moving or obsolete items  which constitutes the main judgment necessary in valuing the inventory 
reserves for both receivables and inventory are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as required 
other assumptions the company faces are the assessment of goodwill  intangible asset  and long lived assets for impairment  the calculation of the provision for income taxes and valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company believes that its assumptions in relation to its critical accounting policies have been reasonably accurate  and does not foresee any future material changes in its estimates or assumptions 
liquidity and financial resources the company s financial condition reflects the january acquisition of fleetwood s drapery operations in douglas  georgia  and the august purchase of a phoenix  arizona manufacturing facility  as shown below working capital at january  was  compared to  at january  the current ratio was at year end compared to at year end the liquid ratio was at year end compared to at year end the long term debt ratio was at january  compared to a year earlier 
net accounts receivable decreased  at january   when compared to january  even though sales levels increased  accounts receivable decreased due to shorter terms arising from the company s supply contract with fleetwood  the receivables servicing agreement the company employs for its hospitality receivables  and improvement in collection efforts 
days sales outstanding decreased from days at the end of fiscal to days at the end of fiscal in january  the company began assigning certain account receivables under a receivables servicing and credit approved receivables purchasing agreement with cit group commercial services inc only receivables from sales to the hospitality industry may be assigned to cit 
under the agreement cit provides credit checking  credit approval  and collection responsibilities for the assigned receivables 
if cit approves an order from a hospitality customer and the resulting receivables are not paid or disputed by the customer within ninety days of sale  cit will pay the receivable to the company and assume ownership of the receivable 
cit begins collection efforts for the assigned receivables both approved and not approved when they are due hospitality sales are made on net terms 
approved receivables were approximately  at january  hospitality customers are instructed to make payments directly to cit and cit then wires collected funds to the company 
the company pays cit six tenths of a percent of all assigned receivables 
management believes this cost will be mostly offset by reductions in bad debt expense and collection costs 
the company entered into this arrangement to take advantage of cit s extensive credit checking and collection capabilities 
management believes this arrangement will improve liquidity 
net inventories increased  at january   when compared to january  the increase in inventories was required to support higher levels of business  two new locations and as a result of the fleetwood acquisition 
excluding the assets acquired from fleetwood  capital expenditures for were  compared to  in of this total   was for land  building  and equipment for the opening of the company s phoenix  arizona facility 
at this time  capital spending for is expected to be between  and  the company had no borrowings at year end under its  revolving line of credit 
the company does expect to use this line of credit periodically during the final payment of  plus accrued interest  to fleetwood enterprises  inc for the acquisition in january was paid in january the line of credit was used to make this payment

ebitda ebitda represents income before income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization and is an approximation of cash flow from operations before tax 
the company uses ebitda as an internal measure of performance and believes it is a useful and commonly used measure of financial performance in addition to income before taxes and other profitability measures under generally accepted accounting principals gaap ebitda is not a measure of performance under gaap 
ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income and income before taxes as an indicator of the company s operations in accordance with gaap 
nor is ebitda an alternative to cash flow from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
the company s definition of ebitda can differ from that of other companies 
the following table reconciles net income  the most comparable measure under gaap  to ebitda for each of the three fiscal years ended january  net income    add income tax    interest expense    depreciation and amortization    ebitda    contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s financial obligations as of january  in thousands and thereafter total employment contracts  operating leases long term debt principal  long term debt interest total   interest on long term debt consists of both fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
projected interest rates on variable interest rate obligations are the interest rates in effect as of january  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for further information about uncertainties from fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company faces minimum potential market risk in its long term debt 
the company had four separate long term debt agreements outstanding as of january  the company faces the risk that if market interest rates increase  the two interest rate obligations of the company with a variable interest rate would require higher payments of interest 
as of january   the bond secured by the company s goshen  indiana property of  had a variable interest rate of per annum 
each increase of could increase interest expense by approximately  in and lower amounts in successive years as principal is paid down  terminating in also  the  bond on the company s bloomsburg  pennsylvania property had a variable interest rate of at january  each increase of in market rates could cause an increase in interest expense of less than  in and lower amounts in successive years as principal is paid down  terminating in interest rates are exclusive of letter of credit fees paid to third parties to guarantee the payment of these obligations  which fees are or less  and are not subject to increase 
the company believes the risks associated with its fixed rate obligations are minimal  as the company believes the current rates approximate current market rates  and that the current market rates are unlikely to go significantly lower 
should market interest rates rise significantly  the company would benefit in that it would have locked in a lower fixed rate that will remain in effect for the life of the loan
