limitations on payment of dividends under applicable new jersey law  the company is not permitted to pay dividends on its capital stock if  following the payment of the dividend  it would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or its total assets would be less than its total liabilities 
further  it is the policy of the frb that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if future retained earnings would be consistent with the company s capital  asset quality and financial condition 
since it has no significant independent sources of income  the ability of the company to pay dividends is dependent on its ability to receive dividends from the bank 
under national banking laws  the bank must obtain the approval of the occ before declaring any dividend which  together with all other dividends declared by the bank in the same calendar year  will exceed the total of the bank s net profits of that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years  less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock 
net profits are to be calculated without adding back any provision for the bank s allowance for loan losses 
furthermore  the bank  as an fdic insured institution  may not pay dividends or make distributions that would cause the institution to fail to meet minimum capital requirements 
these restrictions would not prevent the bank from paying dividends from current earnings to the company at this time 
in addition  as a bank whose deposits are insured by the fdic  the bank may not pay dividends or distribute any of its capital assets while it remains in default of any assessment due to the fdic 
the bank is not in default under any of its obligations to the fdic 
federal regulators also have authority to prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying a dividend if they deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice 

table of contents effect of government monetary policies the earnings of the company are and will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its agencies 
the frb has had  and will likely continue to have  an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order  among other things  to curb inflation or combat a recession 
the frb has a major effect upon the levels of bank loans  investments and deposits through its open market operations in united states government securities and through its regulation of  among other things  the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member banks deposits 
it is not possible to predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies 
usa patriot act the usa patriot act authorizes the secretary of the treasury  in consultation with the other federal financial institution regulatory agencies  to adopt special measures applicable to financial institutions 
among its provisions  the usa patriot act requires each financial institution to establish an anti money laundering program  establish due diligence policies  procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering in united states private bank accounts and correspondent accounts maintained for non united states persons or their representatives  and avoid establishing  maintaining  administering or managing correspondent accounts in the united states for  or on behalf of  a foreign bank that does not have a physical presence in any country 
in addition  the usa patriot act expands the circumstances under which funds in a bank account may be forfeited and requires covered financial institutions to respond under certain circumstances to request for information from federal banking agencies within hours 
the usa patriot act also requires the federal banking regulators to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s anti money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions 
the department of treasury has issued regulations implementing the due diligence requirements of the usa patriot act 
these regulations require minimum standards to verify customer identity and maintain accurate records  encourage cooperation among financial institutions  federal banking agencies  and law enforcement authorities regarding possible money laundering or terrorist activities  prohibit the anonymous use of concentration accounts  and require all covered financial institutions to have in place an anti money laundering compliance program 
sarbanes oxley act the sarbanes oxley act of comprehensively revised the laws affecting corporate governance  auditing and accounting  executive compensation and corporate reporting for entities  such as the company  with equity or debt securities registered under the securities exchange act of among other things  sarbanes oxley and its implementing regulations have established new membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee  imposed restrictions on the relationship between the company and its outside auditors including restrictions on the types of non audit services our auditors may provide to us  imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders  and required our management to evaluate the company s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting  and required our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting 
the nasdaq stock market  inc nasdaq has also adopted corporate governance rules that have been approved by the sec 
the changes required by the sarbanes oxley act and new sec and nasdaq rules are intended to allow stockholders to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and directors 
the company and its board of directors have  as appropriate  adopted or modified the company s policies and practices in order to assure compliance with these regulatory requirements and to enhance the company s corporate governance practices 
as of the date of this report  the company is in the process of carrying out an evaluation  under the supervision and with the participation of our management  including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer  of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
to date  our review of our internal control over financial reporting has not brought any material weaknesses to our attention  and our independent registered public accounting firm has not communicated  any finding of such a material weakness to us 
however  we have not yet completed our assessment and material weaknesses may be identified 
other laws and regulations the company and the bank are subject to a variety of laws and regulations which are not limited to banking organizations 
in lending to commercial and consumer borrowers  and in owning and operating its own property  the bank is subject to regulations and potential liabilities under state and federal environmental laws 
legislation and regulatory changes legislation and regulations may be enacted which increase the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities  or affect the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks  bank holding companies  and other financial institutions are frequently made in congress and before various bank regulatory agencies 
no prediction can be made as to the likelihood of any major changes or the impact such changes might have on the company and the bank 

table of contents employees at december   the company employed full time employees and part time employees 
statistical disclosure the company s statistical disclosure information  required of bank holding companies  is contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which is set forth in item of this report 

table of contents risk factors the following is a discussion of certain significant risk factors that could potentially negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to continue to grow our business  which may adversely impact our results of operations 
during the last five years  our total assets have grown substantially from billion at december  to billion at december  our business strategy calls for continued expansion  but we do not anticipate growth to continue at this rate 
our ability to continue to grow depends  in part  upon our ability to open new branch locations  successfully attract deposits to existing and new branches  and identify favorable loan and investment opportunities 
in the event that we do not continue to grow  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we may not be able to manage our growth  which may adversely impact our financial results 
as part of our expansion strategy  we plan to open new branches in our existing and target markets 
however  we may be unable to identify attractive locations on terms favorable to us or to hire qualified management to operate the new branches 
in addition  the organizational and overhead costs may be greater than we anticipated or we may not be able to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to open new branches 
new branches may take longer than expected to reach profitability  and we cannot assure that they will become profitable 
the additional costs of starting new branches may adversely impact our financial results 
our ability to manage growth successfully will depend on whether we can continue to fund this growth while maintaining cost controls and asset quality  as well as on factors beyond our control  such as national and regional economic conditions and interest rate trends 
if we are not able to control costs and maintain asset quality  such growth could adversely impact our earnings and financial condition 
the company s continued pace of growth may require it to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
the company is required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations 
the company may at some point need to raise additional capital to support continued growth 
the company s ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside the company s control  and on its financial performance 
accordingly  the company cannot assure you of its ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to the company 
if the company cannot raise additional capital when needed  the ability to further expand its operations could be materially impaired 
our exposure to credit risk  because we focus on commercial lending  could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
there are certain risks inherent in making loans 
these risks include interest rate changes over the time period in which loans may be repaid  risks resulting from changes in the economy  risks inherent in dealing with borrowers and  in the case of a loan backed by collateral  risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral 
commercial loans are generally viewed as having a higher credit risk than residential real estate or consumer loans because they usually involve larger loan balances to a single borrower and are more susceptible to a risk of default during an economic downturn 
commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans  which comprise our commercial loan portfolio  were of our total loan portfolio at december  construction and development loans  which are included as part of our commercial real estate loans  were of our total loan portfolio at december  construction financing typically involves a higher degree of credit risk than commercial mortgage lending 
risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely on the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property s value at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost including interest of construction 
if the estimated property value proves to be inaccurate  the loan may be undersecured 
because our loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans 
an increase in nonperforming loans could cause an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge offs  which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents adverse economic and business conditions in our market area may have an adverse effect on our earnings 
substantially all of our business is with customers located within mercer county and contiguous counties 
generally  we make loans to small to mid sized businesses  most of whose success depends on the regional economy 
these businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities 
adverse economic and business conditions in our market area could reduce our growth rate  affect our borrowers ability to repay their loans and  consequently  adversely affect our financial condition and performance 
further  we place substantial reliance on real estate as collateral for our loan portfolio 
a sharp downturn in real estate values in our market area could leave many of our loans undersecured 
if we are required to liquidate the collateral to satisfy the debt securing a loan during a period of reduced real estate values  our earnings could be adversely affected 
if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings would decrease 
in an attempt to mitigate any loan losses we may incur  we maintain an allowance for loan losses based on  among other things  national and regional economic conditions  and historical loss experience and delinquency trends among loan types 
however  we cannot predict loan losses with certainty and we cannot assure you that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  review our allowance for loan losses and may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination 
factors that require an increase in our allowance for loan losses could reduce our earnings 
loss of our key personnel or an inability to hire and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our business 
our future operating results are substantially dependent on the continued service of patrick m 
ryan  our president and chief executive officer  jay g 
destribats  our chairman of the board  and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of mr 
ryan would have a negative impact on our business because of his lending expertise and years of industry experience 
in addition  the loss of the services of mr 
ryan or mr 
destribats could have a negative impact on our business because of their business development skills and community involvement 
our success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and our lending officers and on their relationships with the communities they serve 
the loss of these or other key persons could negatively impact our banking operations 
although we have employment agreements with mr 
ryan  mr 
destribats and our other key personnel  our employees may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key personnel or attract the qualified personnel necessary for the management of our business 
changes in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
our net income depends primarily upon our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans  investments and other interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowed funds 
different types of assets and liabilities may react differently  and at different times  to changes in market interest rates 
we expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities 
that means either our interest bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest earning assets  or vice versa 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets  an increase in market rates of interest could reduce our net interest income 
likewise  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could reduce our net interest income 
we are unable to predict changes in market interest rates  which are affected by many factors beyond our control  including inflation  recession  unemployment  money supply  domestic and international events and changes in the united states and other financial markets 
we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisitions  which may adversely affect our business 
we intend to consider future strategic acquisitions  some of which could be material to us and which may include companies that are substantially equivalent or larger in size compared to us 
we continually explore and conduct discussions with third parties regarding possible acquisitions 
as of the date of this report  we have not entered into any definitive agreement and we do not have any definitive plans relating to any specific acquisitions 
we will have to integrate any acquisitions into our business 
the difficulties of combining the operations  technologies and personnel of companies we acquire include coordinating and integrating geographically separated organizations and integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds 
we may not be able to effectively manage or integrate the acquired companies 
further  we may not be successful in implementing appropriate operational  financial and management systems and controls to achieve the benefits expected to result from these acquisitions 
our efforts to integrate these businesses could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control  such as regulatory developments  general economic conditions and increased competition 
in addition  the process of integrating these businesses could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of our existing business and the loss of key personnel and customers 
the diversion of 
table of contents management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the transition and integration of these businesses could negatively impact our business and results of operations if any of the above adverse effects were to occur 
further  the benefits that we anticipate from any acquisitions may not be obtained 

table of contents competition from other financial institutions in originating loans and attracting deposits may adversely affect our profitability 
we face substantial competition in originating loans 
this competition comes principally from other banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking companies and other lenders 
many of our competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources and higher lending limits  a wider geographic presence  more accessible branch office locations  the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives  as well as lower origination and operating costs 
this competition could reduce our net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that we originate and the interest rates we may charge on these loans 
in attracting deposits  we face substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks  savings institutions and credit unions  as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives  including money market funds 
many of our competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources  more aggressive marketing campaigns  better brand recognition and more branch locations 
these competitors may offer higher interest rates than we do  which could decrease the deposits that we attract or require us to increase our rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits 
increased deposit competition could adversely affect our ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations and increase our cost of funds 
we also compete with non bank providers of financial services  such as brokerage firms  consumer finance companies  insurance companies and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable terms 
some of our non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our operations 
as a result  such non bank competitors may have advantages over us in providing certain products and services 
this competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking services  reduce our market share and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
government regulation significantly affects our business 
the banking industry is extensively regulated 
banking regulations are intended primarily to protect depositors  and the fdic deposit insurance funds  not the stockholders of the company 
we are subject to regulation and supervision by the frb 
the bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the occ 
regulatory requirements affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth 
the bank regulatory agencies possess broad authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements  which involve both quantitative measures of our assets and liabilities and qualitative judgments by regulators regarding risks and other factors 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements or comply with other regulations could result in actions by regulators that could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or otherwise adversely impact operations 
in addition  changes in laws  regulations and regulatory practices affecting the banking industry may limit the manner in which we conduct our business 
such changes may adversely affect us  including our ability to offer new products and services  obtain financing  attract deposits  make loans and achieve satisfactory spreads and impose additional costs on us 
the bank is also subject to a number of federal laws which  among other things  require it to lend to various sectors of the economy and population  and establish and maintain comprehensive programs relating to anti money laundering and customer identification 
the bank s compliance with these laws will be considered by the federal banking regulators when reviewing bank merger and bank holding company acquisitions or commence new activities or make new investment in reliance on the glb act 
as a public company  we are also subject to the corporate governance standards set forth in the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as any rules or regulations promulgated by the sec or nasdaq 
the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting by our management and our independent auditors is not complete  and it is possible that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses could be noted 
we and our independent auditors are currently evaluating our internal control over financial reporting in order to allow management to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  management s assessment of such control as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of and rules and regulations of the sec thereunder 
in the course of our evaluation  we or our independent auditors may identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that have not presently been identified 
we continually encounter technological change  and we may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements  which could reduce our ability to effectively compete 
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introduction of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to better serving customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services to enhance customer convenience  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services  which could reduce our ability to effectively compete 

table of contents our hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage that could harm our business 
we rely upon our existing information systems for operating and monitoring all major aspects of our business  including deposit and loan information  as well as various internal management functions 
these systems and our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters  power loss  network failure  improper operation by our employees  security breaches  computer viruses or intentional attacks by third parties 
any disruption in the operation of our information systems could adversely impact our operations  which may affect our results of operations and financial condition

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to provide the reader with pertinent information to understanding and assessing yardville national bancorp s results of operations for each of the past three years and financial condition for each of the past two years 
throughout this annual report the terms ynb  company  we  us  our  and corporation will refer to yardville national bancorp  our wholly owned banking subsidiary the yardville national bank the bank  and other subsidiaries as a consolidated entity  except where noted 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes and tables included elsewhere in this report 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements with respect to the financial condition  results of operations and business of ynb 
these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements are set herein under the caption forward looking statements on page critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in the preparation of our financial statements we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
ynb s significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
two of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
these policies govern the allowance for loan losses and income tax liabilities 
management has reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies and has discussed these policies with the audit committee 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of possible credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance for loan losses has been determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  under which we are required to maintain adequate allowances for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based on our assessment of several factors 
those factors include reviews and evaluations of specific loans  current economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and the level of classified and nonperforming loans 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover specificially identifiable loan losses  as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses 
we account for income taxes by recognizing the amount of taxes payable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the estimated future tax consequences  which require judgment of events  that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact ynb s consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements include further explanation on the accounting for income taxes

we generate substantially all of our income from our loan and securities portfolios 
our earning asset base is primarily funded through deposits  and to a lesser degree  borrowed funds 
increasing net interest income is critical in reaching our financial goals 
to accomplish our goals  we must effectively manage our cost of funds and expand our loan portfolio 
loan opportunities in our markets have put pressure on our branch network to provide lower cost deposits to fund our growth 
our retail strategy is designed to increase the number of branches in our markets  enhance our brand image and introduce our products and services to an expanded geographic area 
this strategy  however  requires investment of resources in people  facilities  marketing and technology 
while we have seen many positive results  we have not yet fully realized all of the benefits of this ongoing strategic initiative 
during  we opened one branch  continued enhancing our brand image  introduced new products and services  and lowered our cost of funds 
looking forward  we expect to open several branches in and introduce new products and services in our markets 
we believe that by continuing to grow our commercial loan business  expanding our geographic footprint and attracting lower cost core deposits to fund our growth  we will enhance profitability and the value of the ynb franchise 
we earned net income of million or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to million or per diluted share for the year ended december  this represents an increase of and  respectively 
the rebound in our financial performance in was due to strong net interest income growth of million or  primarily due to continued robust commercial loan growth 
partially offsetting the improvement in net interest income was a million increase in non interest expense  as well as higher income tax expense due to notably better financial performance 
return on average assets for increased to compared with in  while the return on average equity increased to in compared to in during  total loans increased million or to billion 
at the same time  overall credit quality strengthened as net loan charge offs declined to million for  compared to almost million in nonperforming asset levels were stable at million or of total assets at december   compared to million or of total assets at the same date in one of our retail strategy objectives  which was ongoing throughout  was to attract lower cost deposits  reduce our cost of funds and increase net interest income 
during  we successfully introduced simply better checking sm  our featured interest bearing demand deposit account  in our home mercer county market 
combined with our other markets  we attracted over million in deposits with this product 
the cost of interest bearing deposits declined basis points for despite the gradually increasing interest rate environment in the second half of the year 
total deposits increased million or to billion from billion at december  lower cost savings  money markets and interest bearing demand deposits increased million or of the total increase in overall deposits 
ynb s non interest expenses increased due primarily to our growth  which resulted in higher salaries and employee benefit costs 
in addition  non interest expenses rose due to increased director and committee fees  the costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance and expenses related to the ongoing execution of our retail strategy 
in spite of the increase in non interest expenses  ynb s efficiency ratio improved to in from in due to the significant growth in net interest income 
we have positioned our balance sheet to take advantage of an environment of gradually increasing interest rates during we believe that we will continue to have opportunities to attract quality commercial borrowers while credit quality strengthens 
with the anticipation of several new branches during  we believe the expansion of our footprint and attractive core deposit products and services will result in a modestly higher cost of funds and an improving net interest margin 
we are optimistic about our prospects for financial success in 
table of contents net interest income net interest income is the largest and most significant component of our operating income 
net interest income is the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends upon the relative amounts and types of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
net interest income is also impacted by changes in interest rates and the shape of market yield curves 
the following table sets forth an analysis of net interest income by each major category of average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the related yields and costs for the years ended december     and average yields for each year are derived by dividing income by the average balance of the related assets  and average costs are derived by dividing expense by the average balance of the related liabilities 
the yields and costs include fees  costs  premiums and discounts  which are considered adjustments to interest rates

for the purpose of calculating loan yields  average loan balances include nonaccrual loans with no related interest income 
the interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
in order to present pre tax income and resultant yields on tax exempt investments and loans on a basis comparable to those on taxable investments and loans  a tax equivalent adjustment is made to interest income 
the tax equivalent adjustment has been computed using the appropriate federal income tax rate for the period and has the effect of increasing interest income by     and  for the years ended december     and  respectively

one of our major objectives in was to continue the improvement in our net interest margin

also contributing to the net interest income improvement was a basis point decline in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a increase in average interest bearing liabilities 

table of contents ynb s financial success in was primarily the result of a higher net interest margin 
we have continued to take advantage of our strength as a commercial business lender while building momentum from our retail strategy 
the combination of a low interest rate environment  the expansion of our branch network in new markets and attractive core deposit products resulted in a lower cost of funds and a higher net interest margin in the net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  was for the twelve months ended december  compared with for the same period in with anticipated continued success in our commercial lending business  the key to moving our net interest margin higher will depend on our ability to cost effectively fund commercial loan growth 
during  interest income rose to million  compared to million for average interest earning assets increased by million or to billion for  compared to billion in the growth in average earning assets was complemented by a basis point increase on the yield of our earning assets to despite a decline in our average loan yield 
loans averaged billion for  representing an increase of million or when compared with billion for during this same time period  loan yields declined basis points to  partially offsetting the impact of higher loan balances on interest income 
that said  interest and fees on loans increased million or 
the principal factor that accounted for the lower loan yield  even with an increase of basis points in short term interest rates in the second half of the composition of our commercial loans portfolio  consisting of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans  contributed to the decrease in the overall loan yield 
the majority of commercial loans booked in were floating rate 
initially  these floating rate loans had a lower yield than fixed rate loans and had the effect of lowering the loan portfolio yield 
approximately of our commercial loans have floating interest rates  typically tied to the prime rate of interest 
in  the average prime rate increased to compared to in over the last few years we instituted floors on a significant portion of our floating rate commercial loans  totaling approximately million  to protect interest income in the lower interest rate environment we were experiencing 
over the last six months of  the floating rates on many of our commercial loans have risen above their floors 
the timing of these commercial loans coming off of their floors as rates increased affected the level of yield improvement 
at year end  approximately of the rates on floating rate commercial loans had come off of their floors 
with short term interest rates expected to increase in  we expect our loan yields to move higher as well 
during  consistent with our historical performance  our level of nonaccrual loans had only a modestly negative impact to our loan yield and interest income 
nonaccrual loans totaled million at december   a modest decrease of  from the million reported in had these nonaccrual loans performed at original contract terms  we would have recognized additional interest income of approximately  in and  in and our tax equivalent net interest margin would have been higher by basis points in and also contributing to net interest income and margin improvement was a higher yield on our securities portfolio 
securities averaged million in  representing a million increase from the prior year  while yields increased basis points to in from in interest on securities increased million or from the improvement in interest income on securities resulted primarily from a higher yield on securities 
as a result of our experience with premium purchased mortgage backed securities in  we strategically moved in a different direction in our goal in was to purchase mortgage backed securities closer to par with stable cash flows 
this action alone  we believed  would reduce the level of premium amortization in the portfolio and protect securities yields from higher prepayment speeds 
in addition  we purchased modestly longer duration securities  which accounted for the increased yield on the securities portfolio 
of note  our investment growth strategy  or securities purchased using borrowed funds to enhance return on average stockholders equity and earnings per share  totaled only million or less than of total assets at december  compared to million or of our assets at december  average interest bearing liabilities rose million to billion  while overall funding costs declined basis points to during the higher volume of average interest bearing liabilities resulted in increased interest expense of  or to million when compared to million in the principal objective of our retail strategy is to reduce or better manage our cost of funds to raise our net interest margin 
to achieve that objective  we have focused on attracting lower cost core deposits and changing the composition of our deposit base 
in addition  our philosophy of relationship banking has resulted in establishing long term business relationships and higher interest free demand balances in growth in average demand deposits of million or to million in positively impacted our net interest margin 
total interest expense on interest bearing deposits remained the same for compared to as higher average interest bearing deposit balances of million were offset by a basis point decline in their cost 
average savings  money market and interest bearing demand deposits increased million  or to million during this past year 
the corresponding cost of funds declined basis points to 
average savings  money markets and interest bearing demand represented of total average interest bearing deposits during compared to for average time deposits  including cds of  or more  represented of our average deposit base during compared to during the cost of these time deposits declined to for compared to in  in part due to our utilization of interest rate swaps on new two year cd money attracted  which lowered the cost of this money 
the changing composition of our deposit base  as a result of our retail strategy  has contributed to our lower overall cost of deposits in 
table of contents average borrowed funds decreased by million or to million during  while related borrowing costs increased by seven basis points to 
the modest increase in interest expense was due to higher costs associate with floating rate advances from the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb that have repriced higher in the second half of as interest rates gradually moved higher 
part of our strategy for improving the net interest margin is to reduce our dependency on borrowed funds 
average borrowed funds declined to of average assets in compared to in average total subordinated debentures increased by million to million during compared to million for interest expense associated with these subordinated debentures increased  due to higher volumes as average costs decreased basis points to from during in june we issued million in additional subordinated debentures  which accounted for the increased volume 
the decrease in the average interest rate is due to two factors 
in  we retired million in fixed rate subordinated debentures with a cost of 
during and we issued million in lower cost floating rate advances  all tied to three month libor 
in a gradually increasing interest rate environment we would expect interest expense on borrowed funds to continue to rise 
meeting our profitability goals in will depend on increasing net interest income and improving our net interest margin 
our two pronged strategic approach that was successful in will continue in most important  from a liability perspective  we will continue to build upon the successes of our retail strategy 
we will continue to open branches in new markets and neighborhoods  promote our brand image and market attractive core deposit products like simply better checking and the recently introduced simply better savings sm 
to effectively manage our cost of funds during our retail building process  we will use alternative funding sources such as reserve funds  which are money market balances acquired through an intermediary that places deposits from brokerage clients with banks 
in addition  we will use interest rate swaps to change the pricing characteristics of certain interest bearing liabilities 
we continue our efforts to reduce our reliance on higher cost time deposits and borrowed funds 
from an earning asset perspective  we must continue to capitalize on opportunities to grow our higher yielding commercial loan portfolio 
we believe our balance sheet is properly positioned to grow net interest income in a gradually increasing interest rate environment in we believe our strategy will give us the best opportunity to increase profitability and franchise value in provision for loan losses we provide for possible loan losses by a charge to current income to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level determined according to our documented allowance adequacy methodology 
the provision for loan losses totaled million for  an increase of  when compared to million for the modest increase is reflective of the strong commercial loan growth experienced in partially offset by lower net charge offs 
the allowance for loan losses increased by million to million at december  compared to million at the end of the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was at december  compared with at december  see asset quality and allowance for loan losses for additional detail and information 
non interest income we earn fee and other income from service charges on deposit accounts and other banking products and services 
these continue to be the most significant components of our fee income 
in addition  we derive considerable non interest income from income on bank owned life insurance boli and net securities gains 
non interest income totaled million in compared to million in  a decrease of  or 
non interest income represented of total revenues for compared to for non interest income  excluding net securities gains and the gain on sale of our operations building in  rose  or to million for when compared to million for the increase was primarily due to higher service charge income partially offset by a reduction in income on bank owned life insurance 
the components of non interest income for the three year period ended december  are presented in the following table 
year ended december  in thousands service charges on deposit accounts income on bank owned life insurance other service fees securities gains  net investment and insurance fees other non interest income total 
table of contents service charges on deposit accounts represented the largest single source of core non interest income in service charges on deposit accounts increased  or due to higher service charges and overdraft fees 
branches in new markets and targeted marketing campaigns have resulted in generating a larger base of lower cost checking accounts in  which generates additional service charge and fee income 
at december   our investment in boli totaled million 
there were no boli assets purchased in in addition  there are no further premiums paid associated with boli assets after their initial purchase 
we have purchased boli to offset the costs of deferred compensation plans and other employee benefits 
income on boli is tax exempt and provides a high rate of return relative to alternative earning assets  while reducing our overall effective income tax rate 
income on boli was million in  a decrease of when compared to million in earnings on boli are impacted by the interest crediting rate determined on an annual basis by the insuring companies 
during  a lower interest crediting rate resulted in a decrease in boli income compared to  reflective of the lower interest rate environment that existed when the interest crediting rate was established 
net securities gains totaled million during compared to million in during  we made the decision to sell selected securities as part of our interest rate risk management process 
we also generate non interest income from a variety of fees earned from general banking services 
these include automated teller machine related fees  second check  wire transfer and check fees 
other service fees increased  to million in from million in other non interest income  which includes mortgage servicing and safe deposit box rentals  totaled  in compared to  in included in our results was the sale of our former operations building to a board member  which resulted in a  gain 
as we continue to build our core retail and commercial customer bases in new markets  we expect to generate additional service fee income  which should translate into higher levels of non interest income 
non interest expense non interest expense totaled million in  an increase of million or  compared to million in the largest increases in non interest expense in were primarily in salaries and employee benefits  and directors and committee fees 
to a somewhat lesser extent  expenses associated with sarbanes oxley section compliance  which includes audit and consulting fees and outsourced services  contributed to the increase in non interest expense 
we continuously assess the effectiveness of our operations 
the efficiency ratio is used by the financial services industry to measure a company s operating efficiency 
the efficiency ratio measures total non interest expense as a percentage of net interest income plus non interest income 
we also measure our efficiency  excluding securities gains and any items deemed to be non recurring 
ynb s efficiency ratio improved in to compared to in excluding net securities gains and the sale of our former operations building in  our efficiency ratio was and for and  respectively 
the improvement in the efficiency ratio was principally due to the increasing level of net interest income 
a decrease in the efficiency ratio is indicative of a more efficient use of resources  while an increase in this ratio indicates a less efficient use of resources

salaries rose million or to million in  primarily due to additional lending staff and from growth 
the full impact of hires  including the staffing of three new branches opened in  is reflected in expense 
we also increased staff in our risk management division as the result of current regulatory and federal requirements 
benefits expense  which includes health benefits and payroll taxes  rose  or to million in the increase in benefits expense was relatively modest due to a non recurring adjustment in our salary continuation costs for executives  which reduced benefits expense in the last quarter of net occupancy expense increased  or to million in from million in total rent expense on leased properties increased  or of the total increase in occupancy expense due to a full year s rent in on new branches opened in and normal rent increases 
also contributing to the increase were typical facilities related expenses such as repairs and maintenance 
equipment expense rose  or to million in the increase in equipment expense was primarily related to costs associated with our automated teller machines  equipment maintenance and depreciation costs 
during we also continued to selectively upgrade technology and systems to ensure quality products and services 
in addition to the opening of branches  marketing continues to be a significant component of our retail strategy 
during we continued to enhance our brand image while consistently marketing our products and services 
marketing expenses increased to million in  compared to million in outside services and processing expenses increased  or to million in from  in outside services and processing expenses include services provided by third parties  outsourced services and consulting fees 
through our third party providers  we have been able to offer quality products and services to our customer base  such as cash management and state of the art website services  including electronic bill payment 
the cost to provide these services  in addition to other processing costs  was  in compared to  in the benefit of outsourcing labor intensive functions  like statement rendering and wire transfer processing  has been the resultant staff savings as we have grown 
during consulting fees almost doubled to  compared to  in  primarily as a result of expenses associated with sarbanes oxley section sox compliance 

table of contents we estimate that the impact to pre tax earnings of implementing sox  as a result of additional expenses  was approximately  to  or to cents on diluted earnings per share in audit and examination fees increased  or to million in compared to  in primarily due to higher audit fees associated with the review of our internal controls and the attestation of our financial statements 
fees paid to our consultant totaled approximately  for sox during  additional staff was also hired to strengthen and address internal control issues 
we also believe the significant time allocated by staff for this compliance effort throughout the bank also resulted in lost revenue opportunities 
we do expect costs associated with sox compliance to be comparatively less in during  we incurred a nonrecurring cost associated with our director deferred compensation plan 
under this plan  outside directors can defer all or a portion of their director  committee and annual retainer fees  while receiving a matching contribution and interest on their deferred funds 
changes and enhancements to the director deferred compensation plan resulted in the plan being underfunded 
as a result  directors and committee fees increased to  for compared to  for we do not anticipate the same growth in directors and committee fees in other expenses totaled million in compared to million in other expenses are comprised of a variety of professional fees  expenses associated with the origination of loans and other operating expenses 
we will continue to make investments in technology  our retail strategy and delivery systems to attract new customers and provide the ongoing quality products and services our customers expect 
we anticipate our efficiency ratio may experience some upward pressure as we continue to grow  but we believe that our efficiency ratio should remain below during income tax we have identified the accounting for income taxes as a critical accounting policy 
the provision for income taxes  comprised of federal and state taxes  was million in compared to million in the provisions for income taxes in and were at effective tax rates of and  respectively 
the increase in tax expense and our effective tax rates was principally due to higher taxable income

total interest earning assets increased to billion in from billion in the growth in interest earning assets was primarily funded in  as was the case in  by the increase in lower cost savings  money markets and interest and non interest bearing demand deposits 
we believe the balance sheet growth we have experienced is reflective of our relationship banking philosophy  strength as a commercial lender and the ongoing successful execution of our retail strategy 
the introduction of simply better checking into our home mercer county market combined with the positive reception we have received in the relatively new demographically attractive markets of hunterdon  somerset and middlesex counties in new jersey is reflected in the continued growth of lower cost core deposits in as a result  we experienced solid financial results in and enhanced the value of our franchise 
loans during we again experienced strong commercial loan demand as the result of the strength of new jersey s real estate market and business activity 
commercial loans  which include commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans  grew as a result of strong consistent growth in our home mercer county market in addition to the further development of lending opportunities in our expanded marketplace 
we emphasize commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending to individuals and small to mid sized businesses 
as a result of our strength as a commercial lender  relationship banking philosophy and market expansion  we have experienced robust lending growth from december  to december  during that period  loans have increased from million to billion  resulting in a compound annual growth rate of approximately

table of contents in underwriting commercial loans  which are primarily secured by real estate  we follow strict underwriting standards 
these standards include varying limits on loan to value ratios based on property types  property condition  quality and experience of the organization or developer managing the property  and evaluation of the cash flow capability of the borrower to repay the loan 
we also analyze the feasibility of these projects  which includes occupancy rates  tenants and lease terms 
additionally  our underwriting standards require independent appraisals  periodic property inspections and the monitoring of operating results 
in addition to real estate  the majority of our commercial loans are secured by business assets and most are supported by personal guarantees and other assets of the principals 
commercial real estate loans increased by million  or in  to billion from million in commercial real estate loans consist of investor occupied  owner occupied  and construction and development loans 
investor occupied and construction and development loans increased by million and million  respectively  in growth in real estate loans accounted for of the total loan growth in compared to in commercial real estate loans generally have a final maturity of five to fifteen years 
commercial mortgages are secured by professional office buildings  retail stores  shopping centers and industrial developments

residential family loans represented million  or of the total 
residential mortgages represent first liens on owner occupied family residences located principally in our markets 
we are a participating seller and servicer with the federal national mortgage association fnma and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc 
we generally underwrite residential real estate loans to conform with standards required by these agencies 
multi family loans  which primarily consist of loans secured by apartment complexes  have historically not been an area of focus  and represented only of total residential real estate loans at december  consumer loans increased to million at december  compared to million at december  consumer loans include fixed rate home equity loans and floating rate lines of credit  indirect auto loans  personal loans and other conventional installment loans 
like the commercial lending portfolio  the majority of our consumer loan portfolio is also secured by collateral 
home equity loans and lines represented of total consumer loans at the end of interest rates on consumer loans in remained relatively attractive  which accounted for the modest increase in our home equity and installment portfolios 
we believe we will have ample opportunities to continue the growth in our commercial loan portfolio during in addition  as we grow our retail network into new markets and neighborhoods  we expect to have opportunities to expand the consumer side of our business 
substantially all of our business is with customers located in mercer county and our northern region  comprised of hunterdon  somerset and middlesex counties  and the contiguous counties that surround those markets 
changes in the region s economic environment  real estate market conditions  competition and consolidation in our markets are all factors that could impact the level of loan growth we expect in asset quality over the five year period ended december   we have successfully grown our loan portfolio while maintaining high asset quality standards 
nonperforming asset levels have averaged less than million during a period in which compound annual growth exceeded 
nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets declined to at december  compared to at december  during we addressed issues relating to several problem loan relationships  which resulted in net charge offs of almost million 
by working closely with our problem loan relationships  we reduced net loan charge offs to million in at december  approximately of our nonperforming assets were represented by three commercial loan relationships 
by working closely with each borrower  each loan relationship is in some form of resolution  which includes collection  restructure or possible charge off 
while the ultimate collectibility of each relationship is not known  we do expect positive improvement in all three relationships during based on our strict underwriting standards  collateral based approach to lending  and depth of lending experience  we are anticipating continued improvement in our asset quality profile in

nonperforming loans are comprised of loans on a nonaccrual basis  loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments but have not been classified as nonaccrual  and loans whose terms have been restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
our policy regarding nonaccrual loans varies by loan type 
generally  commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual when they are days past due  unless these loans are well secured and in the process of collection or  regardless of the past due status of the loan  when management determines that the complete recovery of principal or interest is in doubt 
consumer loans are generally charged off after they become days past due 
residential mortgage loans are not generally placed on nonaccrual status unless the value of the real estate has deteriorated to the point that a potential loss of principal or interest exists 
subsequent payments are credited to income only if collection of principal is not in doubt 
if principal and interest payments are brought contractually current  and future collectibility is reasonably assured  loans are returned to accrual status 
loans are classified as restructured loans when  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial condition  we grant concessions to the customer that we would not otherwise consider 
generally  this occurs when the cash flow of the borrower is insufficient to service the loan under its original terms 
restructured loans remain on nonaccrual until collectibility improves and a satisfactory payment history is established  generally six consecutive monthly payments 
nonperforming loans  primarily comprised of nonaccrual loans  totaled million  a decrease of when compared to total nonperforming loans of million at december  nonaccrual loans  primarily commercial and industrial  represented of the total 
nonaccrual loans totaled million or of total loans at december   compared to million  or of total loans at december  there were no restructured loans outstanding at december  or commercial lending is one of our most critical functions 
while the most profitable part of ynb s business is commercial lending  the risk and complexity of that business is also the greatest 
we have a sound credit culture in place  which includes strict underwriting standards  effective 
table of contents risk assessment  strong credit policies and the periodic evaluation of the overall creditworthiness of borrowers 
our reliance on real estate collateral could result in our earnings being negatively impacted if it were necessary to liquidate our real estate collateral during periods of reduced real estate values 
adverse economic and business conditions could negatively affect our financial condition and performance 
while we believe our levels of nonperforming assets and credit quality will improve in  a number of factors beyond our control could cause nonperforming asset levels to rise from their current or recent levels  which would have a negative impact on our financial performance 
allowance for loan losses we have identified the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level estimated to absorb possible loan losses of the loan portfolio 
the formal evaluation process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for losses takes place on a quarterly basis 
as part of the formal process our commercial lending staff reviews  evaluates and then rates all of our commercial loans based on their respective risks at origination 
the risk classifications range from to or from minimal risk to loss 
a formal loan review process  independent of loan origination  is in place to evaluate risk ratings and monitor risk classifications 
internal loan review reports to our risk management officer  who in turn  reports directly to our audit committee 
currently  the criticized and classified asset committee meets monthly to review criticized and classified assets 
this committee includes the chief financial officer  senior lending officer  senior credit administration officer  senior risk management officer and senior internal loan review officer and an independent director 
during these meetings the committee examines trends of criticized assets and reviews information about classified assets with our lending officers 
loans that fall into criticized categories are further evaluated for impairment as called for in statement of financial accounting standards fasb no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
we measure risk by use of a matrix  which is customized to measure the risk of each loan type 
because we emphasize commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending  the primary focus in our risk rating system is on those loans 
risk ratings of to are considered to be acceptable risk and consist of loans rated as either minimal  modest  better than average  average and acceptable 
loans with acceptable risk were reserved at a range of to at december  risk ratings of between and are considered higher than acceptable risk and consist of loans rated as special mention  substandard and doubtful 
due to the higher level of risk  these loans were reserved at a range of to at december  loans with a risk rating of are considered to be a loss and reserved at 
at december  there were no rated loans 
residential mortgage loans were assigned an individual risk reserve percentage of due to the strong secured nature of these loans and the low levels of losses that have been experienced historically 
consumer loans were assigned reserve percentages of for the lowest risk to for the highest risk dependent on the secured or unsecured status of each consumer loan 
the reserve percentage assigned to each risk rating category is determined quarterly from historical loan loss rates based on an eight quarter rolling trend  utilizing migration analysis 
in addition  we use our judgment concerning the anticipated impact on credit risk of economic conditions  real estate values  interest rates and level of business activity 
allocations for the allowance for loan losses  both specific and general  are determined after this review 
factors used to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses include the amounts and trends of criticized loans  results of regulatory examinations and economic data associated with new jersey s real estate market 
we provide for possible loan losses by a charge to current income to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level according to our documented allowance adequacy methodology

we also measure the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by reviewing coverage of nonperforming loans 
the allowance for loan losses to total nonperforming loans increased to at december  compared to at december  loans or portions of loans deemed uncollectible are deducted from the allowance for loan losses  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off  if any  are added to the allowance 
net loan charge offs were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the ratio of net charge offs to average loans decreased to for compared with for we recognize that despite our best efforts to manage credit risk  losses will occur 
in times of economic slowdown  either within our markets or nationally  the risk inherent in our loan portfolio may increase 
many of our loans depend upon real estate collateral 
any adverse trends in our real estate markets could have a significant negative effect on the quality of our loan portfolio and level of the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to economic conditions and other factors  the timing and amount of loan losses will also be dependent on the specific financial condition of our borrowers 
although we use the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate  which is subject to significant judgment and short term changes 

table of contents allocation of the allowance for loan losses the following table describes the allocation for loan losses among various categories of loans and certain other information as of the dates indicated 
the allowance contains an unallocated portion to cover inherent losses within a given loan category which have not been otherwise reviewed or measured on an individual basis and is distributed proportionately among each loan category 
this unallocated portion of the loan loss allowance is important to maintain the overall allowance at a level that is adequate to absorb potential credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio 
the allocation is made for analytical purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future loan losses may occur

there is limited credit risk in our securities portfolios 
the lower risk weights associated with our securities also has a beneficial impact to our risk based capital ratios

the afs portfolio is a flexible asset and liability management tool that is utilized to take advantage of market conditions that create more attractive returns and to manage liquidity and interest rate risk 
during  as part of our interest rate risk management process  we extended the duration of the securities portfolio 
the duration of our securities portfolio was modestly extended to years at december  compared to approximately years at december  with approximately of our commercial loan assets earning a floating rate of interest  that portion of the balance sheet was positioned for gradually higher interest rates 
the effect of extending duration with longer term rates declining  even as short term rates were rising  was a higher yielding afs portfolio with consistent cash flows and protection to interest income were interest rates to decline 
in addition  mbs purchased in were primarily at levels at or near par  mitigating the risk to the afs portfolio yield due to premium amortization 
the improved yield on the afs portfolio was the primary factor in the increase in the overall securities yield to during compared to during afs securities are reported at market value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  included as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we were able to take advantage of changes in longer term treasury yields to reposition securities throughout the year to improve future securities performance while achieving net securities gains of million 
volatility in the treasury yield curve resulted in a fluctuating level of market value appreciation and depreciation during at december   securities available for sale had a net unrealized loss  net of tax effect  of  compared to a net unrealized loss of  at december   which is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
investment securities  classified as held to maturity  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  investment securities are carried at book value or amortized cost 
obligations of state and political subdivisions or tax free municipal bonds comprise of the total 
the increase in investment securities was due principally to the million increase in the municipal bond portfolio 
the municipal bond portfolio grew to million at december  from million at december  
table of contents municipal bonds were purchased to reduce our effective tax rate and enhance the tax equivalent yield of the portfolio 
based on our anticipated levels of taxable income  we expect to further increase the size of our municipal bond portfolio in at december   investment securities had net unrealized gains of million compared to net unrealized gains of million at december  the expected maturities and average weighted yields for the securities portfolios as of december  are shown below 
yields for tax exempt securities are presented on a fully taxable basis assuming a tax rate 
expected maturities may differ from stated maturities because issuers may have the right to call their obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties

mbs yields reflected in the preceding table are impacted by changes in interest rates and related prepayment activity 
in a rising interest rate environment  mbs prepayment activity would be expected to decrease  extending duration 
conversely  the opposite would occur in a declining interest rate environment 
the negative impact of the amortization of premiums to mbs yields and net interest income has been mitigated through the purchase of mbs in and the latter half of at or close to par 
at december  we had total mbs balances of million  of which million were fixed rate 
mbs securities guaranteed by fnma and fhlmc totaled million and million  respectively  at december  at december   ynb had mortgage backed securities totaling million  of which million were fixed rate 
cmos represented million and million of total outstanding mbs balances at december  and respectively 
cash flows from the mbs portfolio declined to million in compared to million in due to a shift in the composition of the portfolio and comparatively slower prepayment speeds 

table of contents in  our strategy for managing the mbs portfolio will depend on the overall interest rate risk profile of our balance sheet and market conditions 
our goal will continue to be to provide stable  consistent cash flows for liquidity and funding purposes regardless of the interest rate environment 
should the composition of our commercial loan portfolio shift to a more fixed rate profile  then we would expect to purchase mbs with shorter weighted average lives and durations 
we evaluate all securities with unrealized losses quarterly to determine whether the loss is other than temporary 
at december   we determined that all unrealized losses were temporary in nature 
this conclusion was based on several factors  including the strong credit quality of the securities with unrealized losses  the performing nature of these securities  and the low level and short time frame of the unrealized losses 
management believes that the unrealized losses in the securities portfolios were caused by changes in interest rates  market credit spreads  and perceived and actual changes in prepayment speeds on mortgage backed securities 
for a discussion of these matters  see notes to consolidated financial statements note deposits deposits represent our primary funding source supporting earning asset growth 
over the last several years  we have concentrated on the successful implementation of our retail strategy 
the objectives of this ongoing strategy are to expand our geographic footprint into new markets  strengthen our brand image  introduce new products and services  manage our cost of funds and continue to enhance the value of our franchise 

table of contents in  we enjoyed considerable success in executing our retail strategy 
aided by a lower interest rate environment that continued into the first half of  we were able to lower our cost of interest bearing deposits to for compared to in we also enhanced or introduced several new deposit products in to attract new relationships to ynb 
these included simply better checking for retail customers  and new and improved business checking products for our business customers 
expanding our branch network is another critical factor in enhancing our franchise value and controlling our cost of funds 
while only one branch was opened in  we anticipate opening additional branches in both and we expect to open an additional branch in hopewell township mercer county early in the second quarter of for the remainder of we are developing plans to open additional branches in mercer county and an additional branch in hunterdon county  new jersey and bucks county  pennsylvania 
as many as five branches could be opened in with several sites planned for as shown in the following table  core deposit interest bearing demand and non interest bearing demand deposits were the two principal areas of deposit growth during average total deposits increased million  or to billion for compared to billion for the average interest rate paid on our deposits during declined basis points to  compared to during despite a basis point increase in short term interest rates in the last half of  the strengthening of our core deposit base without a significant change in the level of higher cost time deposits contributed to our lower cost of deposits

our relationship banking philosophy requires the majority of our small business and commercial customers to establish deposit accounts with us 
the increase in non interest bearing demand deposits was primarily attributable to the growth in new and existing business relationships 
during  several of our business demand deposit offerings were enhanced  which resulted in a major contribution to the increase in balances 
average non interest bearing demand deposits increased million or in average interest bearing demand deposits increased during average money market and savings deposits increased and  respectively  in the primary factor contributing to the continued outstanding growth in interest bearing demand deposits during was our simply better checking product 
simply better checking is a relationship oriented interest bearing demand deposit account with a competitive interest rate guaranteed for a month period 
the initial introduction of this product in was in our northern region and we exceeded goals in attracting these deposits using targeted direct mail and advertising 
in  we introduced simply better checking to our home mercer county market with outstanding results 
for   net new accounts were opened with approximately million in balances 
at december   total simply better checking sm balances exceeded million 
in addition  through an extensive marketing campaign  we opened net new lower cost chairman s choice accounts of  with net new balances of million 
these accounts further solidify relationships with our customers 
to supplement our in market deposit growth  we successfully bid and retained surrogate s deposits minor trust accounts in several new jersey counties 
surrogate s deposits totaled approximately million at year end during the last quarter of  approximately million of these deposits were up for competitive bid 
we were successful in the competitive bidding process  increasing the level of surrogate s deposits by approximately million to million for the majority of these funds will be up for competitive bid in and approximately million will be up for bid in december we now have surrogate s deposits from mercer  burlington  camden  hunterdon  middlesex  monmouth  ocean and warren counties in new jersey 

table of contents money market deposits include personal and business accounts as well as money market balances acquired through an independent third party intermediary reserve funds that places deposits from brokerage clients with banks 
during  we experienced a shift out of our personal premier money market accounts into higher yielding simply better checking  which contributed to a decline in money market balances of approximately million 
reserve funds  which totaled less than million at the end of  increased to million at the end of  partially offsetting the movement of our money market deposits into higher rate deposit alternatives 
the rate we pay on reserve funds is at a premium over the federal funds rate 
reserve funds have been used to support commercial loan growth and liquidity  at a cost less expensive than time deposits in we believe this funding source to be reliable and stable  and it continues to be part of our funding strategy in the cost of average money market deposits declined basis points to for compared to for we would expect the cost of money market deposits to increase in based on the projected interest rate environment for total average time deposits  consisting of both certificates of deposit of  or more and other time deposits  modestly increased or million to million from million in the cd portfolio s maturity profile is relatively short  with average months to maturity of approximately months at december  due to the repricing characteristics and pricing of time deposits in relation to other deposit products  the average cost of time deposits declined basis points in to from in at december  total average time deposits represented of average total deposits compared to during we have selectively marketed cds in our new markets during for greater marketplace identity 
in addition  to help fund our loan growth and retain retail cd relationships we introduced a competitively priced two year cd product 
we then used interest rate swaps to change the pricing characteristics of some of these funds  lower our cost of funds and better match the repricing characteristics of our floating rate commercial loans 
we also market our cds nationally through a computer based software service 
these cds totaled million at december  compared to million at december  this funding source has been a dependable management tool for liquidity and funding purposes although historically  these funds tend to be more costly 
we would expect time deposits to be a more important funding source in as rates begin to rise 
the following table details amounts and maturities for certificates of deposit of  or more for the years indicated december  in thousands maturity range within three months after three months but within six months after six months but within twelve months after twelve months total we will continue to execute our retail strategy in and expect to attract lower cost core deposits and effectively manage our cost of funds in what is expected to be a higher interest rate environment  while increasing net interest income and our net interest margin 
for  we have introduced a new savings product called simply better savings and a new checking product called preferred choice checking  which comes with free on line bill payment  to all of our markets 
our new competitively priced savings product is expected to change the composition of our deposit base and we believe help retain simply better checking balances repricing off of their initial month introductory rate 
in addition  this product will be showcased during as we open new branches 
enhanced cash management services will also be available in the first half of this year to our business and commercial customers 
we believe these new products and services  along with the marketing of existing products and services  should help us manage our cost of funds in a rising interest rate environment  and create and expand profitable retail and business relationships 
while we believe we have the tools to effectively manage our cost of funds  there are significant challenges for with the firming of financial markets and increased competition from other financial institutions  we may not be able to fund our asset growth with lower cost core deposits as our customers seek the highest return possible on their funds 
funding our growth with higher cost deposits would potentially have a negative affect on net interest income and our net interest margin 

table of contents borrowed funds we utilize borrowed funds for our earning asset growth not provided by deposit generation and for asset and liability management purposes 
borrowed funds consist primarily of fhlb advances 
borrowed funds totaled million at december   an increase of million or when compared to million at december  the increase in borrowed funds was due principally to the increase in fhlb advances and subordinated debentures 
we believe that as we continue to implement our retail strategy that borrowed funds will represent a less significant portion of our funding 
at december   borrowed funds declined to of our assets compared to at year end fhlb advances totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in advances in was due to million in short term advances used to bolster short term liquidity at year end 
those advances were paid off in january our fhlb advance portfolio is collateralized by securities and mortgages residential and commercial 
at december   we had million in advances collateralized by securities and million by mortgages 
as additional commercial and residential mortgages qualify as collateral  it is our intent to replace securities collateral with mortgage collateral when advances are renewed to enhance our liquidity profile 
we have used fhlb advances for funding earning asset growth  enhancing liquidity  managing interest risk and funding the purchase of certain securities 
we currently own million of fhlb stock due to requirements associated with these borrowings 
our fhlb advances at december  were comprised of million in advances priced at or near one month or three month libor  all maturing in  callable advances totaling million and million in term funding 
callable advances have terms of five to ten years and are callable after periods ranging from three months to five years 
callable borrowings totaled million at december   of which million have call dates in generally  as interest rates continue to rise  advances have more likelihood of being called  while the opposite is true when rates fall 
based on our analysis at the end of we would not expect to see significant calls in unless interest rates were to rise basis points from year end levels 
maturing libor based advances in december totaling million were renewed in comparatively longer term callable advances with call dates of one or two years 
we determined to extend these advances based on attractive opportunities presented by the treasury yield curve at that time 
we believe the cost on these advances will be relatively less expensive based on the outlook for interest rates in excluding subordinated debentures  borrowed funds averaged million in  a decrease of million from the million average reported in the average cost of borrowed funds  driven primarily by fhlb advance rates  increased seven basis points to during compared to during the increase in cost is primarily the result of libor based advances pricing higher as short term interest rates increased in the second half of our fhlb advances represent a comparatively more expensive piece of our funding base 
the fixed rate portion of our fhlb advance portfolio will become less expensive should rates continue to rise  although the likelihood of calls could increase as well 
we are evaluating strategies to change the pricing characteristics of our fixed rate advances using derivatives 
those decisions will be dependent on several factors including our view of future interest rates  and asset and liability management objectives 
subordinated debentures we have obtained a portion of capital needed to support the growth of the bank and for other purposes through the sale of subordinated debentures of yardville national bancorp to subsidiary statutory business trusts of yardville national bancorp trusts 
these trusts exist for the sole purpose of raising funds through the issuance of trust preferred securities  typically in private placement transactions  and investing the proceeds in the purchase of the subordinated debentures 
the interest rate on the subordinated debentures is identical to the interest rate on the trust preferred securities 
subordinated debentures are the sole assets of each trust and each trust is obligated to distribute all proceeds of a redemption of the subordinated debentures  whether voluntary or upon maturity  to holders of its trust preferred securities 
yardville national bancorp s obligation with respect to the subordinated debentures  when viewed together with the obligations of each trust with respect to its trust preferred securities  provides a full and unconditional guarantee on a subordinated basis by yardville national bancorp of the obligations of each trust to pay amounts when due on the trust preferred securities of each respective trust 

table of contents as of december   our trust subsidiaries  along with the transaction date  principal amount of subordinated debentures issued  interest rate of subordinated debentures  maturity date of subordinated debentures  commencement date for redemption of subordinated debentures  and principal use of proceeds  were comprised of the following in thousands principal interest maturity earliest date upon amount of rate for date of which subordinated subordinated subordinated redemptions are name of trust transaction date debentures debentures debentures permitted yardville capital trust ii june  june  june  yardville capital trust iii march  june  june  yardville capital trust iv february  floating rate based on three month libor plus basis points march  march  yardville capital trust v september  floating rate based on three month libor plus basis points october  october  yardville capital trust vi june  floating rate based on three month libor plus basis points july  july  total the principal use of proceeds for yardville capital trust  ii  iii and v were contributed as capital to the bank to support growth 
a portion of the proceeds of yardville capital trust iv were used to retire the subordinated debentures of yardville capital trust in march with the remainder contributed as capital to the bank to support growth 
the proceeds from capital trust vi are being used to meet cash flow needs of the holding company  which may include contributions of capital to the bank to support growth 
the cost of subordinated debentures declined basis points to in compared to in floating rate subordinated debentures represented approximately of total subordinated debentures of million at december and were comparatively less expensive than fixed rate subordinated debentures 
borrowed funds also include  related to our employee stock ownership plan esop 
with our deposit base continuing to grow we expect that borrowed funds as a percentage of assets will continue to diminish in importance 
as interest rates rise  fixed rate advances will become more valuable and may provide management with the opportunity to reposition or retire a portion of our borrowings 
we will use derivatives  if appropriate  to change the pricing characteristics of our borrowed funds to protect or improve future income streams 

table of contents contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities  and off balance sheet arrangements the following table presents  as of december   our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date 
the payment amounts represent those amounts contractually due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts  or other similar carrying value adjustments 
payments due by period less more than than in thousands year years years years total contractual obligations time deposits borrowed funds subordinated debentures operating lease obligations other long term liabilities total in the normal course of business  we enter into certain contractual obligations 
such obligations include obligations to make future payments on debt and lease arrangements  as well as payments on deferred compensation and postretirement benefits 
we have no capital lease obligations or other significant long term contractual obligations 
time deposits are shown at the maturity date 
borrowed funds include periodic payments of principal 
noncallable borrowed funds are shown at the maturity date  while callable borrowed funds are shown at either the call date  if a call was deemed likely at december   or otherwise at the maturity date 
subordinated debentures are shown at the maturity date 
we enter into a variety of financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit  both of which involve to varying degrees  elements of risk in excess of the amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
credit risk for letters of credit is managed by limiting the total amount of arrangements outstanding and by applying normal credit policies to all activities with credit risk 
collateral is obtained based on management s credit assessment of the customer 
the contract amounts of off balance sheet financial instruments as of december  and for commitments to extend credit were million and million  respectively  and for letters of credit  were million and million  respectively 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit may expire without being drawn upon  and therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements 
further discussion of our other commitments and contingent liabilities is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we have commitments and obligations under other postretirement benefit plans as described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
asset and liability management asset and liability management involves the evaluation  monitoring  and managing of market risk  interest rate risk  liquidity risk and the appropriate use of capital  while maximizing profitability 
our asset and liability committee alco provides oversight to the risk management process 
this committee consists of both management and members of the board of directors 
alco recommends policy guidelines regarding exposure to interest rates  and liquidity and capital limits for approval by the board of directors 
adherence to these policies is monitored on an ongoing basis and decisions related to the management of interest rate exposure due to changes in balance sheet composition and or market interest rates are made when appropriate and agreed to by alco and approved by the board of directors 
one of the primary goals of asset and liability management is to prudently maximize net interest income 
the risk to net interest income is derived from the difference in the maturity and repricing characteristics between assets and liabilities 
market and interest rate risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in loans  securities  deposits and borrowings 
we seek to manage our asset and liability portfolios to help reduce any adverse impact on net interest income and earnings caused by fluctuating interest rates 
we are subject to interest rate risk because assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times for example  if assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally falling  earnings will initially decline 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts for example  when the general level of interest rates is falling  we may reduce rates paid on checking and savings accounts by an amount that is less than the general decline in market interest rates 
short and long term interest rates may change by different amounts  or the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change 
in addition  interest rates may have an indirect impact on loan demand  credit losses and other sources of earnings 

table of contents the primary goals of our interest rate risk management are to control exposure to interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet  determine the appropriate risk level given our strategic objectives  and manage the risk consistent with alco and the board of directors approved limits and guidelines 
these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short and long term time horizons 
our alco meets monthly to discuss pertinent asset and liability issues 
on a quarterly basis  we provide a detailed review of our interest rate risk position to the board of directors 
we manage and control interest rate risk by identifying and quantifying interest rate risk exposures through the use of net interest income simulation and economic value at risk models 
both measures may change periodically as the balance sheet composition and underlying assumptions change 
we also use a traditional gap analysis that complements the simulation and economic value at risk modeling 
the gap analysis does not assess the relative sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates and also does not fully account for embedded options  caps and floors 
the gap analysis is prepared based on the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for selected time periods 
one measure of interest rate risk is the gap ratio  which is defined as the difference between the dollar volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified period of time as a percentage of total assets 
a positive gap results when the volume of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds that of interest rate sensitive liabilities within comparable time periods 
a negative gap results when the volume of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds that of interest rate sensitive assets within comparable time periods 
as indicated in the table  our one year gap position at december  was 
beginning in the second half of  prime related commercial loans with floors totaling approximately million started to reprice higher 
prior to the first increase in the federal funds rate in late june  these floating rate loans were at their floors  which effectively converted these floating rate loans to fixed rate loans 
the targeted federal funds rate increased basis points by year end and approximately of our floating rate loans were off their floors at december  the combination of adding callable fhlb advances and simply better checking deposits  in addition to floating rate commercial loans coming off their floors has resulted in our increasing positive gap 
gaps  as a static measurement  cannot capture the effects of options on earnings 
generally  a financial institution with a positive gap position will most likely experience an increase in net interest income during periods of rising rates and decreases in net interest income during periods of falling interest rates 
included in the analysis of our gap position are certain savings  money markets and interest bearing demand deposits  which are less sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates than other interest bearing sources of funds 
in determining the sensitivity of such deposits  we review the movement of our deposit rates relative to market rates over a month period 
historically  we had used regression analysis to determine deposit sensitivity  but due to the lower interest rate environment experienced over the last several years  recent pricing patterns are considered a more accurate tool

we dynamically model our interest income and interest expenses over specified time periods under different interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures 
we measure the sensitivity of net interest income over and month time horizons  based on assumptions approved by alco and ratified by the board of directors 
the board has established certain policy limits for the potential volatility of net interest income as projected by the simulation model 
in our base case simulation  the composition of the balance sheet is kept static 
volatility is measured from a base case where interest rates are assumed to be flat and is expressed as the percentage change  from the base case  in net interest income over and month periods with a change in interest rates of plus and minus basis points over a month period and continuation of rates at that level for the second year 
the base case scenario is measured within a policy guideline of change in net interest income in year one and change in year two 
the following table reflects the estimated change in net interest income from the base case scenario for a one and two year period based on our december  balance sheet percentage change in net interest income change in market interest rates basis points flat basis points 
table of contents based on our simulation analysis  we believe our interest rate risk position remains fairly balanced over the next to months whether we experience either rising or falling interest rates 
our net interest income will benefit most from gradually rising interest rates due to our asset sensitive profile 
through changes in the composition and characteristics of the balance sheet in  we have positioned ourselves to experience rising net interest income levels in and a higher net interest margin in what is expected to be a gradually rising rate environment 
throughout  the majority of our new commercial loans had floating rates of interest 
during we extended the duration of our securities portfolio  which enhanced current period earnings but reduced modestly the expected net interest income improvement in a higher interest rate environment 
the effect of funding the majority of our loan growth with simply better checking deposits provided a benefit in a higher interest rate environment but increased the risk to net interest income in a lower rate environment 
the asset sensitive profile continued through year end as liabilities were lengthened as floating rate borrowings were changed to callable borrowings at their maturity dates and additional commercial loans came off of their floors 
while we anticipate positive net interest income improvement in a gradually rising interest rate environment  two factors could limit the extent of the improvement 
first  our modeling assumes that our core deposit rates increase at a slower pace than overall interest rates 
to the extent that we increase our core deposit rates faster than the model assumptions our benefit to rising rates will be reduced 
in addition  approximately million in floating rate commercial loans  tied to the prime rate of interest  have interest rate caps 
the weighted average cap rate is and the caps have an weighted average life of months 
the weighted average rate is 
if rates rise above the cap levels  these loans will become fixed rate loans 
we also measure  through simulation analysis  the impact to net interest income based on expected balance sheet growth scenarios  in addition to rate ramps or increases greater than over and month periods 
when factoring our financial projections growth scenario into the simulation model  we see similar results to our base case 
based on our simulation analysis  we believe our net interest income would be fairly comparable to our base case  assuming expected changes in balance sheet composition 
due to the assumptions used in preparing our simulation analysis  actual outcomes could differ significantly from the simulation outcomes 
economic value at risk we also measure long term interest rate risk through the economic value of equity eve model 
this model involves projecting cash flows from our assets and liabilities over a long time horizon  discounting those cash flows at appropriate interest rates  and then aggregating the discounted cash flows 
our eve is the estimated net present value of these discounted cash flows 
the variance in the economic value of equity is measured as a percentage of the present value of equity 
the sensitivity of eve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the sensitivity of long term earnings to changes in interest rates 
we use the sensitivity of eve principally to measure the exposure of equity to changes in interest rates over a relatively long time horizon 
the following table lists our percentage change in eve in a plus or minus basis point rate shock at december  and the policy guideline is 
due to the low interest rate environment in  not all interest rates could be shocked basis points 
percentage change in eve change in market interest rates rate shock basis points basis points based on the underlying assumptions  we were within our policy guidelines at year end and during  our longer term interest rate risk profile was modestly better in a plus basis point rate shock at december  compared to the same period in in an immediate interest rate increase of basis points our profile was slightly improved from its level due to growth in our core deposit base and the lengthening of liability durations 
at december   our most significant long term interest rate risk exposure as measured by eve  is the exposure to lower rates 
the risk relates primarily to our fhlb callable advances 
due to their above market interest costs  these advances reduce the present value of equity 
due to the relatively longer maturity dates of these advances  the downward rate shock results in significant market losses on our holdings and negatively impacts our present value of equity 
management believes that as these advances move closer to their maturity dates and become a smaller portion of our funding base that their negative impact on our longer term interest rate risk profile will moderate over time 
management believes that the likelihood of a basis point drop in rates is small  and therefore  additional actions to limit this risk are not required 
we do continue to closely monitor our longer term rate exposures and evaluate strategies to reduce risk while still reaching financial goals 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the previously discussed interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in the simulation and eve analysis require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
there are many factors that management evaluates when constructing the assumptions used in short term and long term interest rate risk models 
one of the most important assumptions involves deposits without fixed maturity dates 
these include non interest bearing demand  interest bearing demand  savings and money market deposits  and represent a significant portion of our deposit base 
we believe these deposits are less sensitive to changes in interest rates than other interest bearing assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
the balance of these deposits and the rates paid on them may fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates  competition  or by the fact that customers may add or withdraw these deposits at any time at no cost 
these characteristics and the lack of a maturity date makes modeling these deposits for both simulation and eve purposes very difficult 
a modest change in the maturity term or repricing characteristics can result in very different outcomes 
since each financial institution assigns different repricing and maturity terms to these non maturity deposits  comparing risk between institutions without understanding the treatment of non maturity deposits has limited value 
another source of uncertainty reflects the 
table of contents options embedded in many of our financial instruments  which included loans  investments and callable fhlb advances 
to deal with the many uncertainties when constructing either short or long term interest rate risk measurements  management has developed a number of assumptions 
depending on the product or behavior in question  each assumption will reflect some combination of market data  research analysis and business judgment 
assumptions are reviewed periodically with changes made when deemed appropriate 
accordingly  although these models provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on ynb s net interest income or economic value of equity and may differ materially from actual results 
we believe that more likely scenarios include gradual changes in interest rate levels 
we continue to monitor our gap position and rate shock analyses to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating interest rates 
we have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on assets  sell securities  enter into derivative financial instruments  or seek funding sources with different repricing characteristics in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk changes 
derivatives we use and expect to use derivatives in the future to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in the results of operations or in other comprehensive income  depending on the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction 
derivative interest rate contracts may include interest rate swaps  caps and floors  and are used to modify the repricing characteristics of specific assets and liabilities 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  we competitively priced two year cds to fund commercial loan growth and improve our liquidity profile by locking in funding for the next twenty four months 
over this same period the majority of our commercial loan growth had floating rates tied to the prime rate of interest 
this resulted in a significant mismatch between the repricing characteristics of these loans and the cds 
this mismatch exposed us to interest rate risk 
to reduce this risk we entered into million in notional value pay floating swaps designated as fair value hedges at inception 
these swaps allowed us to more closely match the repricing characteristics of the cds with the loans  and lock in spreads of approximately basis points for the period of the swaps should rates either rise or fal 
these transactions reduced interest expense on time deposits by  for the year ended december  the credit risk associated with these derivative instruments is the risk of nonperformance by the counter party to the agreements

liquidity risk the objective of effective liquidity management is to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as the operating cash needs of ynb at the most reasonable cost 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs or unexpected deposit outflows 
alco is responsible for liquidity risk management 
this committee recommends liquidity policy guidelines that are approved by the board of directors and receives detailed monthly reports on our liquidity position  including compliance with limits and guidelines 
in addition  these reports include a review of forecast liquidity needs over time frames up to one year and the adequacy of funding sources to meet these needs 
as part of liquidity risk management  we have developed a detailed contingency funding plan 
on a quarterly basis  alco reviews the adequacy of funding in adverse environments due to changes in interest rates  credit markets or other external risks through its contingency funding report 
traditional sources of liquidity include deposit growth and scheduled amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage backed securities principal 
we emphasize maximizing and maintaining customer deposits through our relationship banking philosophy 
deposit rates and levels are monitored  and trends and significant changes are reported up through alco 
deposit strategies are reviewed for consistency with our liquidity policy objectives 
in addition  we have used and may continue to use borrowed funds to support and enhance liquidity 
in addition to the ongoing execution of our retail strategy in  which has increased core deposits  we utilize a nationwide computer software based service to raise funds through placement of cds to bolster liquidity and fund loan growth 
brokered cd facilities are also available as another source of liquidity 
mortgage backed securities represented approximately of total securities at december  and generated substantial cash flows of approximately million during  which strengthened liquidity 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mbs are generally a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and securities prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rates and competition 

table of contents we are eligible to borrow additional funds from the fhlb subject to its stock and collateral requirements  and individual advance proposals based on fhlb credit standards 
fhlb advances are collateralized by securities as well as residential and commercial mortgage loans 
subject to collateral requirements  we also maintain lines of credit totaling approximately million at december  with the fhlb and three brokerage firms 
we also have the ability to borrow at the federal reserve discount window 
we also maintain unsecured federal funds lines totaling million with five correspondent banks for daily funding needs 
at the financial holding company level  we use cash to pay dividends to stockholders and interest due on subordinated debentures 
the principal source of funding for these payments generally comes from dividends from the bank 
during  we continued actions to further strengthen our liquidity profile 
the ongoing execution of our retail strategy has increased core deposits 
core deposits have historically provided a relatively stable source of funding 
we hold a diversified portfolio of marketable securities from which funds could be promptly generated 
total unpledged securities were approximately million market value at december  in addition  mortgage backed securities have provided cash flows to support asset growth in effective liquidity planning and management will be critical in funding loan growth at a reasonable cost to achieve profitability targets in we believe the ongoing execution of our retail strategy  cash flows from our securities portfolios  competitive bidding on surrogate s deposits and the development of additional funding sources will provide the funding to achieve profitability goals in capital management the management of capital in a highly regulated environment requires a balance between earning the highest return for stockholders while maintaining sufficient capital levels for proper risk management  satisfying regulatory requirements  and for future expansion 
our capital management is designed to generate attractive returns on equity to our stockholders and to assure that we are always well capitalized  as defined by regulatory authorities  while having the necessary capital for our expansion plans 
stockholders equity at december  totaled million compared to million at december  the increase in stockholders equity was primarily due to the increase in undivided profits 
the increase in equity of million or resulted from earnings of million  proceeds of  from exercised stock options  proceeds of  from shares issued through our dividend reinvestment plan   from allocated esop shares  and an increase of  associated with the fair market adjustment related to the allocation of shares from the esop  partially offset by cash dividend payments of million and positive adjustment to equity of  from the appreciation in market value of securities available for sale 
we have an esop that permits eligible employees to share in our growth through stock ownership 
in may  the esop purchased an additional  shares from our k plan for  the ynb stock fund  a fund offered through our k plan  was discontinued in may the esop financed the stock purchase with a loan from a nonaffiliated financial institution 
the loan is for a term of two years with a maturity date of december  the balance of the new loan will be repaid in equal installments over the remaining term of the loan 
the shares purchased by the esop were used as collateral for the loan 
at december   the original loan used to purchase  shares for million  when the esop was initiated in  had been paid in full 
the balance of unallocated esop shares at december  was  the annual expenses associated with the esop were  in   in and  in these expenses include compensation expense  debt service on the loan and any adjustment required due to changes in the market value of the shares at time of allocation 
the reason for the decrease in cost was related to common shares allocated 
in june  the stockholders approved a non qualified stock option plan for non employee directors the directors plan 
the directors plan allows for the granting of  shares of our common stock at an option price no less than the market value of the stock on the date of grant 
options granted under this plan vest immediately and have a term not to exceed ten years 
this plan provides for a grant of  options per year to each non employee director who is a director on the day immediately after each annual meeting of stockholders

table of contents regulatory capital we are subject to capital guidelines under federal banking regulations 
these banking regulations relate a company s regulatory capital to the risk profile of its total assets and off balance sheet items  and provide the basis for evaluating capital adequacy 
under these guidelines  assets and certain off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories each with applicable weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and certain off balance sheet items 
these guidelines require a minimum ratio of total risk based capital to total risk weighted assets total risk based capital of  tier capital to total risk weighted assets tier risk based of and a tier capital to average total assets tier leverage of at least 
at december   the most recent notification from the appropriate federal regulator categorized the company as well capitalized under the regulatory framework 
under the capital adequacy guidelines  a well capitalized institution must maintain a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a tier leverage ratio of at least 
the following table sets forth our regulatory capital ratios at december   and december  in thousands tier leverage tier risk based total risk based financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin was issued in january fin applies immediately to enterprises that hold a variable interest in variable interest entities created after january  it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  to enterprises that hold a variable interest in variable interest entities created before february  in december  fasb issued a revised version of fin fin r  which required us to deconsolidate our subsidiary trusts 
this change in accounting guidance led to some uncertainty as to the tier capital treatment of trust preferred securities under frb s capital adequacy regulations 
partly in response to this accounting change  the frb has amended its risk based capital standards for bank holding companies to allow for the continued inclusion of outstanding and prospective issuances of trust preferred securities in tier capital subject to stricter quantitative limits and qualitative standards 
under the amended rule  the aggregate amount of trust preferred securities and certain other capital instruments would be limited to of tier capital  net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
the amount of trust preferred securities and certain other capital instruments in excess of the limit could be included in tier capital  subject to restrictions 
the amended rule provides a five year transition period for the application of the quantitative limits 
the company would continue to follow gaap in accounting for these instruments for regulatory reporting purposes 
the amended rule would not impact the company s existing treatment of trust preferred securities for purposes of computing its tier capital  nor would it affect the capital adequacy rating of the bank  which remains well capitalized
