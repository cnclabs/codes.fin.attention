funds from operations funds from operations is a non gaap measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry 
the most directly comparable gaap measure to funds from operations is net income loss 
although the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit has published a definition of funds from operations  modifications to the nareit calculation of funds from operations are common among reits  as companies seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their business 
funds from operations  as defined by nareit  is presented by us as a supplemental financial measure 
funds from operations is not used by us as  nor should it be considered to be  an alternative to net income loss computed under gaap  as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of our ability to fund our cash needs 
funds from operations is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present  nor do we intend it to present  a complete picture of our financial condition and operating performance 
we believe that net income loss computed under gaap remains the primary measure of operating performance and that funds from operations is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net income loss computed under gaap 
further  we believe that our consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with gaap  provide the most meaningful picture of our financial condition and our operating performance 

table of contents nareit s funds from operations measure adjusts net income loss computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated properties 
we agree that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons a historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes  through depreciation charges  that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
nareit stated in its white paper on funds from operations since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
consequently  nareit s definition of funds from operations reflects the fact that real estate values  as an asset class  generally fluctuate over time to reflect market conditions 
b reits were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of long term ownership and management of real estate 
the exclusion  in nareit s definition of funds from operations  of gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long term assets that form the core of a reit s activities and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
at the same time that nareit created and defined its funds from operations concept for the reit industry  it also recognized that management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community 
we believe that financial analysts  potential investors and shareholders who review our operating results are best served by the nareit defined funds from operations measure used together with  but not as a substitute for  net income loss computed under gaap and cash from operating activities computed under gaap 
investors analyses of the performance of real estate companies tend to be centered on understanding the asset value created by real estate investment decisions and understanding current operating returns that are being generated by those same investment decisions 
the adjustments to net income loss computed under gaap that are included in arriving at the nareit defined funds from operations measure are helpful to management in making real estate investment decisions and evaluating our current operating performance 
we believe that these adjustments are also helpful to industry analysts  potential investors and shareholders in their understanding and evaluation of our performance on the key measures of valuation and current operating returns generated on real estate investments 
while we believe that the nareit defined funds from operations measure is an important supplemental measure  it should not be used alone because it excludes significant economic components of net income loss computed under gaap and is  therefore  limited as an analytical tool 
some of these limitations are depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from funds from operations 
funds from operations is limited as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets 
further  the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of real estate properties are not reflected in funds from operations 
gains or losses from property dispositions  if any  represent changes in the value of the disposed properties 
funds from operations  by excluding these gains and losses  does not capture realized changes in the value of disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions 
we compensate for these limitations by using our funds from operations measure only in conjunction with net income loss computed under gaap 
to further compensate  we reconcile the funds from operations measure to net income loss computed under gaap in our financial reports 
additionally  we provide investors with our complete financial statements prepared under gaap  our definition of funds from operations which includes a discussion of the limitations of using the non gaap measure and a reconciliation of our gaap measure net income loss to our non gaap measure so that investors can appropriately incorporate the measure and its limitations into their analyses

as we generally reinvest the proceeds from property dispositions into the acquisition of new properties  we believe that it is necessary to discuss our results of operations after discontinued operations have been added back to the respective revenue and expense line items to provide a representation of the balances that management uses to evaluate the results of operations for the periods presented

critical accounting policies revenue recognized on a straight line basis we recognize rental revenue on a straight line basis at amounts that we believe we will collect on a tenant by tenant basis 
the estimation process may result in higher or lower levels from period to period as our collection experience and the credit quality of our tenants changes 
actual amounts collected could be lower or higher than the amounts recognized on a straight line basis if specific tenants are unable to pay rent that we have previously recognized as revenue  or if other tenants remain whom we previously believed would not 
carrying value of rental properties  investments in development and other investment assets our rental properties  investments in development and other investment assets such as operating joint ventures and mortgage loans receivable are generally carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value 
certain development and operating joint ventures include our share of undistributed income or loss arising from the investment  and the mortgage loans receivable include accrued interest 
in addition  some interest  payroll and general and administrative costs incurred in connection with our development activities may be capitalized 
the actual value of our portfolio of property  investments in development and other investments could be significantly higher or lower than their carrying amounts 
our status as a real estate investment trust we have elected to be taxed as a reit under sections to of the internal revenue code 
a real estate investment trust generally is not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its real estate investment trust taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders  provided that at least of real estate investment trust taxable income is distributed and other requirements are met 
we believe that we have complied with all requirements to qualify as a reit for each of the years in the three year period ended december  accordingly  no provision for income taxes is included in our consolidated financial statements

inflation leases at the office properties typically provide for rent adjustment and pass through of certain operating expenses during the term of the lease 
substantially all of the leases at the industrial properties provide for pass through to tenants of certain operating costs  including real estate taxes  common area maintenance expenses  and insurance 
we anticipate that these provisions may permit us to increase rental rates or other charges to tenants in response to rising prices and therefore  serve to reduce our exposure to the adverse effects of inflation 
forward looking statements  factors that may affect operating results this report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities and exchange act of  including statements regarding our expectations  hopes  intentions  beliefs and strategies regarding the future

all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof 
because these forward looking statements involve risk and uncertainty  there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in the forward looking statements 
those important factors include the unpredictability of both the frequency and final outcome of litigation  our insurance carriers binding conclusion that no insurance coverage extends to a particular claim  an unexpected inability to collect or access capital  availability and creditworthiness of prospective tenants and our ability to execute lease deals with them  defaults or non renewal of leases by customers  market fluctuations in rental rates  concessions and occupancy  reduced demand for office space  failure of market conditions and occupancy levels to improve in certain geographic areas  difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in effecting acquisitions  our failure to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations  increased interest rates and operating costs  our failure to obtain necessary outside financing  the adoption of sfas no 
revised has an unanticipated  negative impact on our financial position  an interpretation of fair value differing from ours prevails in the application of sfas no 
 an interpretation of lease provisions differing from ours prevails in a dispute regarding recovery of expenses  the unpredictability of changes in accounting rules  
table of contents our inadvertent or technical failure to have met all requirements to qualify as a reit  risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction including construction delays  cost overruns  our inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to these activities  unanticipated difficulties with joint venture partners  and continuing threat of terrorist attacks 
the forward looking statements in this annual report on form k are subject to additional risks and uncertainties further discussed under risk factors below and in our form q s filed for the periods ended march   june  and september  we assume no obligation to update or supplement any forward looking statement 
risk factors we have identified a number of risk factors  which could adversely affect our stock value  asset value  or cash flow available to pay debt service or dividends 
market fluctuations in rental rates and occupancy could adversely affect our operations our portfolio of leases turns over continuously  with the number and value of expiring leases varying from year to year 
our ability to re lease the space to existing or new tenants at rates equal to or greater than those realized historically is impacted by  among other things  the economic conditions of the market in which a property is located  the availability of competing space including sublease space offered by tenants who have vacated space in competing buildings prior to the expiration of their lease term  and the level of improvements which may be required at the property 
we cannot assure you that the rental rates we obtain in the future will be equal to or greater than those obtained under existing contractual commitments 
if we cannot lease all or substantially all of the expiring space at our properties promptly  or if the rental rates are significantly lower than expected  then our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
tenants defaults could adversely affect our operations our ability to manage our assets is subject to federal bankruptcy laws and state laws that limit creditors rights and remedies available to real property owners to collect delinquent rents 
if a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt  we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor in possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating to that tenant 
we also cannot be sure that we would receive rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover our expenses with respect to the premises 
if a tenant becomes bankrupt  the federal bankruptcy code will apply  which in some instances may restrict the amount and recoverability of our claims against the tenant 
a tenant s default on its obligations to us could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we may suffer adverse consequences if our revenues decline since our operating costs do not necessarily decline in proportion to our revenue we earn a significant portion of our income from renting our properties 
our operating costs  however  do not necessarily fluctuate in relation to changes in our rental revenue 
this means that our costs will not necessarily decline even if our revenues do 
our operating costs could also increase while our revenues do not 
if our operating costs increase but our rental revenues do not  we may be forced to borrow to cover our costs  we may incur losses and we may not have cash available for distributions to our shareholders 
our cash flow may be insufficient for debt service requirements as of december   we had approximately million of total indebtedness  approximately million of which is subject to variable interest rates and approximately million of which is subject to fixed interest rates 
further  we intend to incur indebtedness in the future  including through borrowings under our unsecured bank line of credit  to finance property acquisitions  retirement of debt and stock repurchases 
as a result  we expect to be subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that interest rates may increase  our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt  and we may be unable to refinance or repay the debt as it comes due 

table of contents debt restrictions may affect our operations and negatively affect our ability to repay indebtedness at maturity our current million unsecured bank line of credit contains provisions that restrict the amount of distributions we can make 
these provisions provide that distributions may not exceed of funds from operations for any fiscal quarter 
if we cannot obtain acceptable financing to repay indebtedness at maturity  we may have to sell properties to repay indebtedness or properties may be foreclosed upon  which could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and ability to service debt 
also  as of december   approximately million of our total indebtedness included secured mortgages with cross collateralization provisions 
in the event of a default  the holders of this indebtedness may seek to foreclose upon properties which are not the primary collateral for their loan 
this may  in turn  accelerate other indebtedness secured by these properties 
foreclosure of properties would cause us to lose income and asset value 
fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our operations as of december   we had approximately million of variable interest rate indebtedness 
accordingly  an increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest payments we make to service the debt which would adversely affect our net income and results of operations 
we may be unable to complete acquisitions and successfully operate acquired properties we continue to evaluate the market of available properties and may acquire office and other properties when strategic opportunities exist 
our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully operate them may be exposed to the following significant risks potential inability to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate investors with significant capital  including both publicly traded reits and institutional investment funds  even if we are able to acquire a desired property  competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price  even if we enter into agreements for the acquisition of office properties  these agreements are subject to customary conditions to closing  including completion of due diligence investigation to our satisfaction  we may be unable to finance the acquisition at all or on favorable terms  we may spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties  we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions  particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties  into our existing operations and  as a result  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected  market conditions may result in higher than expected vacancy rates and lower than expected rental rates  and we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse  or with only limited recourse  with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for clean up of undisclosed environmental contamination  claims by tenants  vendors or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners  directors  officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties 
if we cannot finance property acquisitions on favorable terms  or operate acquired properties to meet our financial expectations  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  per share trading price of series a preferred stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to you could be adversely affected 
dependence on executive officers we depend on the efforts of andrew batinovich  our president and chief executive officer  and michael steele  our executive vice president and chief operating officer  as well as our other executive officers 
the loss of the services of any of them could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
both andrew batinovich and michael steele have entered into employment agreements with us  as have some of the other executive officers 

table of contents potential liability due to environmental matters under federal  state and local laws relating to protection of the environment  or environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances on the property 
these owners may be required to investigate and clean up the contamination on the property as well as the contamination which has migrated from the property 
environmental laws typically impose liability and clean up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the contamination 
this liability may be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility 
in addition  the owner or operator of a property may be subject to claims by third parties based on personal injury  property damage and or other costs  including investigation and clean up costs  resulting from environmental contamination 
environmental laws may also impose restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used or transferred or in which businesses may be operated 
these restrictions may require expenditures 
under the environmental laws  any person who arranges for the transportation  disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of investigation or clean up of those substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not the facility is or ever was owned or operated by that person 
our tenants generally are required by their leases to operate in compliance with all applicable environmental laws  and to indemnify us against any environmental liability arising from their activities on the properties 
however  we could be subject to environmental liability relating to our management of the properties or strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest in the properties 
also  tenants may not satisfy their indemnification obligations under the leases 
we are also subject to the risk that any environmental assessments of our properties  properties being considered for acquisition  or the properties owned by the partnerships managed by us may not have revealed all potential environmental liabilities  any prior owner or prior or current operator of these properties may have created an environmental condition not known to us  or an environmental condition may otherwise exist as to any one or more of these properties 
any one of these conditions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition or ability to service debt  either directly with respect to our properties  or indirectly with respect to properties owned by partnerships we manage 
moreover  future environmental laws  ordinances or regulations may have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and ability to service debt 
also  the current environmental condition of those properties may be affected by tenants and occupants of the properties  by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of the properties such as the presence of underground storage tanks  or by third parties unrelated to us 
environmental assessments and potential liability due to asbestos containing materials environmental laws also govern the presence  maintenance and removal of asbestos containing building materials 
these laws require that asbestos containing building materials be properly managed and maintained and that those who may come into contact with asbestos containing building materials be adequately informed and trained 
they also require that special precautions  including removal or other abatement  be undertaken in the event asbestos containing building materials are disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building 
these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements 
they also may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 
all of the properties that we presently own have been subject to phase i environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants 
some of the phase i environmental assessments recommended further investigations in the form of phase ii environmental assessments  including soil and groundwater sampling 
we have completed all of these investigations or are in the process of completing them 
some of our properties have been found to contain asbestos containing building materials 
we believe that these materials have been adequately contained and we have implemented an asbestos containing building materials operations and maintenance program for the properties found to contain asbestos containing building materials 

table of contents some  but not all  of the properties owned by partnerships we manage have been subject to phase i environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants 
we determine on a case by case basis whether to obtain phase i environmental assessments on these properties and whether to undertake further investigation or remediation 
some of these properties contain asbestos containing building materials 
in each case  we believe that these materials have been adequately contained and we have implemented an asbestos containing building materials operations and maintenance program for the properties found to contain asbestos containing building materials 
potential environmental liability resulting from underground storage tanks some of our properties  as well as properties that we previously owned  are leased or have been leased to owners or operators of businesses that use  store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
these businesses include dry cleaners that operate on site dry cleaning plants and auto care centers 
some of these properties contain  or may have contained  underground storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances 
these operations create a potential for the release of those substances 
some of our properties are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain underground storage tanks used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
a few of our properties have been contaminated with these substances from on site operations or operations on adjacent or nearby properties 
in addition  some properties are on  or are adjacent to or near other properties upon which others  including former owners or tenants of the properties  have engaged or may engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
environmental liabilities may adversely affect operating costs and ability to borrow the obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing environmental laws as well as the cost of complying with future legislation may affect our operating costs 
in addition  the presence of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances at any of our properties  or the failure to remediate those properties properly  may adversely affect our ability to borrow by using those properties as collateral 
the cost of defending against claims of liability and the cost of complying with environmental laws  including investigation or clean up of contaminated property  could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
general risks of ownership of real estate we are subject to risks generally incidental to the ownership of real estate 
these risks include changes in general economic or local conditions  changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties in an area  the impact of environmental protection laws  changes in interest rates and availability of financing which may render the sale or financing of a property difficult or unattractive  changes in tax  real estate and zoning laws  and the creation of mechanics liens or similar encumbrances placed on the property by a lessee or other parties without our knowledge and consent 
should any of these events occur  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
general risks associated with management and leasing contracts we are subject to the risks generally associated with the property management and leasing businesses 
these risks include the risk that management contracts or service agreements may be terminated  contracts will not be renewed upon expiration or will not be renewed on terms consistent with current terms  and leasing activity generally may decline 

table of contents uninsured losses may adversely affect operations we  or in certain instances  tenants of our properties  carry property and liability insurance with respect to the properties 
this coverage has policy specification and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties 
however  certain types of losses such as from earthquakes and floods may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
further  certain of the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity and floods 
should a property sustain damage as a result of an earthquake or flood  we may incur losses due to insurance deductibles  co payments on insured losses or uninsured losses 
additionally  we have elected to obtain insurance coverage for certified acts of terrorism as defined in the terrorism risk insurance act of  however  our policies of insurance may not provide coverage for other acts of terrorism 
any losses from such other acts of terrorism might be uninsured 
should an uninsured loss occur  we could lose some or all of our capital investment  cash flow and anticipated profits related to one or more properties 
this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
illiquidity of real estate may limit our ability to vary our portfolio real estate investments are relatively illiquid and  therefore  will tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio quickly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  the internal revenue code and individual agreements with sellers of properties limit our ability to sell properties 
twenty three of the properties in our portfolio were acquired on terms and conditions under which they can be disposed of only in a like kind exchange or other non taxable transaction for limited periods of time 
the agreed upon time periods for these restrictions on dispositions vary from transaction to transaction 
potential liability under the americans with disabilities act all of our properties are required to be in compliance with the americans with disabilities act 
the americans with disabilities act generally requires that places of public accommodation be made accessible to people with disabilities to the extent readily achievable 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act requirements could require removal of access barriers 
non compliance could result in imposition of fines by the federal government  an award of damages to private litigants and or a court order to remove access barriers 
because of the limited history of the americans with disabilities act  the impact of its application to our properties  including the extent and timing of required renovations  is uncertain 
pursuant to lease agreements with tenants in certain of the single tenant properties  the tenants are obligated to comply with the americans with disabilities act provisions 
if our costs are greater than anticipated or tenants are unable to meet their obligations  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
development alliances may adversely affect operations we may  from time to time  enter into alliances with selected developers for the purpose of developing new projects in which these developers have  in the opinion of management  significant expertise or experience 
these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals  the receipt of which cannot be assured 
these development activities also may entail certain risks  including the risk that management may expend funds on and devote time to projects which may not come to fruition  construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates  possibly making the project uneconomical  occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may be less than anticipated  and expenses at a completed development may be higher than anticipated 
in addition  the partners in development alliances may have significant control over the operation of the alliance project 
therefore  these investments may  under certain circumstances  involve risks such as the possibility that the partner might become bankrupt  have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interest or goals  or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives 
consequently  actions by a partner in a development alliance might subject property owned by the alliance to additional risk 
although we will seek to maintain sufficient control of any alliance to permit our objectives to be achieved  we may be unable to take action without the approval of our development alliance partners 
conversely  
table of contents our development alliance partners could take actions binding on the alliance without our consent 
in addition  should a partner in a development alliance become bankrupt  we could become liable for the partner s share of the project s liabilities 
these risks may result in a development project adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition 
joint investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision making authority and reliance upon a co venturer s financial condition we co invest with third parties through partnerships  joint ventures  co tenancies or other entities  acquiring non controlling interests in  or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of  a property  partnership  joint venture  co tenancy or other entity 
therefore  we will not be in a position to exercise sole decision making authority regarding that property  partnership  joint venture or other entity 
investments in partnerships  joint ventures  or other entities may involve risks not present were a third party not involved  including the possibility that our partners  co tenants or co venturers might become bankrupt or otherwise fail to fund their share of required capital contributions 
additionally  our partners or co venturers might at any time have economic or other business interest or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals 
these investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale  because neither we nor the partner  co tenant or co venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture 
consequently  actions by such partner  co tenant or co venturer might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk 
in addition  we may in specific circumstances be liable for the actions of our third party partners  co tenants or co venturers 
as of december  we were participating in four unconsolidated operating joint ventures encompassing four properties and had an aggregate basis in the joint ventures totaling approximately million 
as of december   our share of joint venture debt totaled million 
material tax risks since  we have operated as a reit under the internal revenue code 
however  we may not be able to maintain our status as a reit 
to qualify as a reit  we must satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions 
only limited judicial or administrative interpretation exists for these provisions and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
we receive nonqualifying management fee income and  as a result  we may approach the income test limits imposed by the internal revenue code 
there is a risk that we may not satisfy these tests 
even if we continue to qualify as a reit  we will be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
our failure to qualify as a reit would be costly we believe we have operated in a manner to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and intend to continue to so operate 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of factual matters and circumstances 
these matters  some of which may not be totally within our control  can affect our qualification as a reit 
for example  to qualify as a reit  at least of our gross income must come from designated sources that are listed in the reit tax laws 
we are also required to distribute to shareholder at least of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains 
the fact that we hold our assets through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status 
furthermore  congress and the internal revenue service  which we refer to as the irs  might make changes to the tax laws and regulations  and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult  or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
also  unless the irs grants us relief under specific statutory provisions  we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify 
if we failed to qualify as a reit  we would have to pay significant income taxes and would therefore have less money available for investments or for distributions to shareholders 
this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities 
in addition  the reit tax laws would no longer require us to make any distributions to shareholders 

table of contents new tax legislation reduces tax rates for dividends paid by non reit corporations under legislation recently enacted  the maximum tax rate on dividends to individuals has generally been reduced from to from january  through december  
the reduction in rates on dividends is generally not applicable to dividends paid by a reit except in limited circumstances that we do not contemplate 
although this legislation will not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends paid by reits  the favorable treatment of regular corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals to consider stock of non reit corporations that pay dividends as relatively more attractive than stocks of reits 
it is not possible to predict whether such a change in perceived relative value will occur or what the effect  if any  this legislation will have on the market price of our stock 
possible changes in tax laws  effect on the market value of real estate investments income tax treatment of reits may be modified by legislative  judicial or administrative action at any time 
these changes may be applied to past as well as future operations 
legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to the qualification as a reit or the federal and state income tax consequences of this qualification 
in addition  the changes might also indirectly affect the market value of all real estate investments  and consequently our ability to realize our investment objectives 
our indebtedness restrictions may adversely affect our ability to incur indebtedness our organizational documents limit our ability to incur additional debt if the total debt  including the additional debt  would exceed of the borrowing base 
this could limit our ability to incur debt to fund new acquisitions  capital improvements to existing properties  or dividends 
this debt limitation in our charter can only be amended by an affirmative vote of the majority of all outstanding stock entitled to vote on such amendment 
the term borrowing base is defined as the greater of fair market value or total market capitalization 
fair market value is based upon the value of our assets as determined by an independent appraiser 
total market capitalization is the sum of the market value of our outstanding capital stock  including shares issuable on exercise of redemption options by holders of units of the limited partnership  plus debt 
an exception is made for refinancings and borrowings required to make distributions to maintain our status as a reit 
in light of these debt restrictions  it should be noted that a change in the value of our common stock could affect the borrowing base  and therefore our ability to incur additional indebtedness  even though such change in the common stock s value is unrelated to our liquidity 
to maintain our reit status  we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions in order to maintain our reit status  we may need to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the reit distribution requirements  even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings 
to qualify as reit  we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least of our net taxable income each year  excluding capital gains 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which dividends paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of of our ordinary income  of our capital gain net income and of our undistributed income from prior years 
we may need short term debt or long term debt  proceeds from asset sales  creation of joint ventures or sale of common stock to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes  or the effect of non deductible capital expenditures  the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments 
limitation on ownership of common stock and stockholder s rights plan may preclude acquisition of control provisions of our charter are designed to assist us in maintaining our qualification as a reit under the internal revenue code by preventing concentrated ownership in our common and preferred stock which might jeopardize our reit qualification 
among other things  these provisions provide that any transfer or acquisition of our common or preferred stock that would result in our disqualification as a reit under the internal revenue code will be void  and if any person attempts to acquire shares of our common or preferred stock that after the acquisition would cause the person to own an amount of common stock and preferred stock in excess of a predetermined limit  such acquisitions would be void 

table of contents ownership is determined by operation of certain attribution rules set out in the internal revenue code 
pursuant to board action  the limit currently is of the value of the outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock 
we refer to this limitation as the ownership limitation 
the common stock or preferred stock the transfer of which would cause any person to violate the ownership limitation  is referred to as the excess shares 
a transfer that would violate the ownership limitation will be void and the common stock or preferred stock subject to the transfer will automatically be transferred to an unaffiliated trustee for the benefit of a charitable organization designated by the board of directors until sold by the trustee to a third party or purchased by us 
this limitation on the ownership of common stock and preferred stock may preclude the acquisition of control of us by a third party without the consent of the board of directors 
in general  the board of directors may waive the ownership limitation for any person 
in this circumstance  the ownership limitation will be proportionally and automatically reduced with regard to all other persons such that no five persons may own more than of the value of the common stock and preferred stock 
certain other provisions contained in our charter and bylaws may also have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal and may thereby inhibit a change in control of us even if a change in control would be in the best interests of the stockholders 
in addition  in july  the board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan 
under the plan  we declared a dividend of rights on our common stock 
the rights issued under the plan will be triggered  with certain exceptions  if and when any person or group acquires  or commences a tender offer to acquire  or more of our shares 
the rights plan is intended to prevent abusive hostile takeover attempts by requiring a potential acquirer to negotiate the terms of an acquisition with the board of directors 
however  it could have the effect of deterring or preventing an acquisition of us  even if a majority of our stockholders would be in favor of such acquisition  and could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to gain control of us or to change existing management 
risks of litigation certain claims and lawsuits have arisen against us in our normal course of business 
we believe that such claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flow or results of operations 
uncertainty due to the board of directors ability to change investment policies the board of directors may change our investment policies without a vote of the stockholders 
if our investment policies change  the risks and potential rewards of an investment in the shares may also change 
in addition  the methods of implementing our investment policies may vary as new investment techniques are developed 
effect of market interest rates on price of common stock the annual yield on the price paid for shares of our common stock from our distributions may influence the market price of the shares of our common stock in public markets 
an increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to seek a higher annual yield from their investments 
this may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
shares available for future sale we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of shares of our common stock or future conversions or exercises of securities for future sales will have on the market price of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the perception that substantial sales could occur  may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rates we are exposed to changes in interest rates obtainable on our secured and unsecured borrowings 
our expectation is that changes in market interest rates will not have a material impact on the performance or fair value of our mortgage loans receivable 
it is our policy to manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for our borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
in order to maximize financial flexibility when selling properties and minimize potential prepayment penalties on fixed rate loans  we have also entered into several variable rate debt arrangements 
approximately at december  and at december  of our outstanding debt  including amounts borrowed under our unsecured bank line of credit  were subject to variable rates 
in addition  the average interest rate on our debt increased from 
table of contents at december  to at december  we review interest rate exposure in the portfolio continually in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
we do not have any other material market sensitive financial instruments 
it is not our policy to engage in hedging activities for speculative or trading purposes 
we may enter into forward interest rate  or similar  agreements to hedge specific anticipated debt issuances where we believe the risk of adverse changes in market rates is significant 
under a forward interest rate agreement  if the referenced interest rate increases  we are entitled to a receipt in settlement of the agreement that economically would offset the higher financing cost of the debt issued 
if the referenced interest rate decreases  we make payment in settlement of the agreement  creating an expense that economically would offset the reduced financing cost of the debt issued 
at december   we were not a party to any forward interest rate or similar agreements 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on rates in effect at the reporting date 
expected maturity date thereafter total fair value in thousands secured fixed average interest rate secured variable average interest rate unsecured variable average interest rate a change of in the index rate to which our variable rate debt is tied would change the annual interest we incurred by approximately  based upon the balances outstanding on variable rate instruments at december
