overview we design  manufacture and market high performance  real time digital signal and image processing computer systems that transform sensor generated data into information which can be displayed as images for human interpretation or be subjected to additional computer analysis 
these multicomputer systems are heterogeneous and scalable  allowing them to accommodate several microprocessor types and to scale from a few to hundreds of microprocessors within a single system 
we are an oem supplier to our commercial markets and conduct business with our defense customers via commercial off the shelf cots distribution  which means that product requests by customers are a primary driver of revenue fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
customers specify delivery date requirements that coincide with their need for our product 
because these customers may use our products in connection with a variety of defense programs or other projects with different sizes and durations  a customer s orders for one quarter generally do not indicate a trend for future orders by that customer 
additionally  order patterns of one customer do not necessarily correlate with the order patterns of another customer and  therefore  we generally cannot identify sequential quarterly trends  even within our business units 
during the past several years  the majority of our revenue has been generated from sales of our products to the defense electronics market  generally for use in intelligence gathering electronic warfare systems 
our activities in this area have focused on the proof of concept  development and deployment of advanced military applications in radar  sonar and airborne surveillance 
imaging and visualization solutions is another primary market that we currently serve 
our computer systems are embedded in magnetic resonance imaging mri  positron emission tomography pet  and digital x ray machines 
our remaining revenues are derived from computer systems used in such commercial oem solutions as semiconductor photomask generation  wafer inspection  baggage scanning  seismic analysis and development of new reticle inspection and wafer inspection systems 
during fiscal year  revenues increased by million compared to fiscal year  primarily as a result of a million increase in deg revenues  a million increase in ivs revenues and a million increase in osg revenues  as well as million of revenues associated with the acquisition of mci 
gross margins as a percentage of revenues decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year primarily due to a product mix shift from deg to osg and ivs as well as the acquisition of mcg  all of which generate lower gross margins than deg and increased inventory and warranty provisions 
operating expenses increased by million for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to several factors 
first  we incurred million of incremental operating expenses associated with our acquisitions of tgs group and arc  which were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and our acquisition of mci  which was completed in the second quarter of fiscal year second  selling expenses and research and development expenses unrelated to these acquired companies increased by million year over year 
finally we incurred a million increase in professional services in connection with sarbanes oxley compliance efforts and other corporate initiatives 
we continue to monitor key operating metrics in order to maintain an appropriate operating expense cost structure relative to our revenue growth expectations 
on september   we acquired a voting interest in momentum computer  inc mci  a manufacturer and developer of high performance embedded processor and i o boards  for million  which was recorded at that time as an investment in an unconsolidated entity 
in december  we acquired the remaining voting interest in mci in a separately negotiated transaction  paying million in cash and agreeing to pay up to million of additional cash consideration if specified operating income and revenue targets are achieved by mci over the months following the closing 
any such additional payments will be recorded as additional goodwill if and when incurred 
the total purchase price for the acquisition of mci was million  consisting of cash payments of million and transaction costs of million directly related to the acquisition 
we believe the acquisition of mci will expand the breadth our product offerings across all of its markets 
the results of mci s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since december  from september  to december   we recorded our pro rata share of mci s net operating results under the equity method of accounting 
in december  we entered into an agreement with the former shareholders of tgs group that finalized the purchase price for the fiscal year acquisition and  as a result  we paid million in cash and issued  shares of our common stock  representing the final payment of the purchase price 
the total purchase price of million for the acquisition of tgs group consisted of total cash payments of million   shares of our common stock valued at million  and million of transaction costs directly related to the acquisition 
on july   we acquired sohard ag sohard for approximately million in cash  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
sohard is a global market leader in the development of advanced software solutions for medical imaging systems  hardware and firmware for commercial embedded systems and software intelligence applications delivered via professional services 
sohard is headquartered in fuerth  germany 
on august   we purchased echotek corporation echotek for approximately million  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
the purchase price was paid in a combination of cash and shares of mercury common stock  with such stock representing approximately of the total purchase price 
based in huntsville  alabama  echotek is a market leader in the development of data acquisition products 
going forward  business and market uncertainties may affect future results 
for a discussion of key factors that could impact the future and must be managed by us  please refer to the discussion below 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for bad debts  warranties  contingencies  litigation  and the valuation of inventory  long lived assets  goodwill  and income tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
changes in our estimates from period to period  such as changes in assumptions underlying our estimates  may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
similarly  using the ends of the range of reasonably possible amounts that we determined in formulating our estimate  rather than the reported estimate  may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  during the past three fiscal years  such changes in our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable and inventory valuation and to warranty cost accruals  have not had a material impact on our overall financial performance or on any individual line item in our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenue from system sales is recognized upon shipment provided that title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  and customer acceptance criteria  if any  have been successfully demonstrated 
certain contracts with customers require us to perform tests of our products prior to shipment to ensure their performance complies with our published product specifications and  on occasion  with additional customer requested specifications 
in these cases  we conduct such tests and  if they are completed successfully  include a written confirmation with each order shipped 
as a result  at the time of each product shipment  we believe that no further customer testing requirements exist and that there is no uncertainty of non acceptance by our customer 
in the rare instance that customer payment is conditioned upon final acceptance testing by the customer at its own facility  we do not recognize any revenue until the final acceptance testing has been completed and written confirmation from the customer has been received 
for multiple element arrangements  we defer the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price that is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered 
for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit  the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis  there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement  and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially within our control 
we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance  which represents deferred revenue 
fair value is the price charged when the same or similar element is sold separately 
installation of our products requires insignificant effort that does not alter the capabilities of the products and may be performed by our customers or other vendors 
if an order includes installation or training services that are undelivered at the time of product shipment  we defer revenue equal to the fair value of the installation or training obligations until such time as the services have been provided 
we determine these fair values based on the price typically charged to our customers who purchase these services separately 
for transactions involving the licensing of standalone software products and of software that is not incidental to the product  we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery of the software has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
our standalone software products are not deemed essential to the functionality of any hardware system and do not require installation by us or significant modification or customization of the software 
the fair value of maintenance agreements related to standalone software products is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of each maintenance agreement 
in limited circumstances  we engage in long term contracts to design  develop  manufacture or modify complex equipment 
for these contracts  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting  measuring progress toward completion based on contract cost incurred to date as compared with total estimated contract costs 
the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs  including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the contract  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  anticipated increases in wages and prices for subcontractor services and materials  and the availability of subcontractor services and materials 
our estimates are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers  program managers and other personnel who review each long term contract monthly to assess the contract s schedule  performance  technical matters and estimated cost at completion 
when adjustments in estimated contract costs are determined  such revisions may have the effect of adjusting in the current period the earnings applicable to performance in prior periods 
anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which determined 
we do not provide our customers with rights of product return  other than those related to warranty provisions that permit repair or replacement of defective goods 
we accrue for anticipated warranty costs upon product shipment 
at the time of product shipment  we assess collectibilty of trade receivables based on a number of factors  including past transaction and collection history with a customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collectibilty of a particular sale is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured  which generally occurs upon receipt of payment from the customer 
after the time of sale  we assess our exposure to changes in our customers abilities to pay outstanding receivables and record allowances for such potential bad debts 
inventory inventory  which includes materials  labor and manufacturing overhead  is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
on a quarterly basis  we use consistent methodologies to evaluate inventory for net realizable value 
we record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory  consisting of on hand and non cancelable on order inventory in excess of estimated usage 
the excess and obsolete inventory evaluation is based upon assumptions about future demand  product mix and possible alternative uses 
if actual demand  product mix or possible alternative uses are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets result from the our acquisition of myriad logic  inc  the tgs group  arc and mci see note g and consist of identifiable intangible assets  including completed technology  licensing agreements  customer backlog and customer relationships 
acquired intangible assets are reported at cost  net of accumulated amortization and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of four months to five years 
goodwill is the amount by which the cost of the acquired net assets in a business acquisition exceeded the fair values of the identifiable assets on the date of purchase 
goodwill is not amortized in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually  on a reporting unit basis  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
long lived assets long lived assets primarily include property and equipment and acquired intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate our long lived assets for events and circumstances that indicate a potential impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset as compared to the recorded value of the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
income tax assets we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and assess the need for a valuation allowance 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
except for deferred tax assets acquired in the tgs group acquisition  we believe that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized based on forecasted income  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our expectations of future income 
we have provided a full valuation allowance against the net amount of tgs group deferred tax assets 
warranty accrual our product sales generally include a one year hardware warranty 
at time of product shipment  we accrue for the estimated cost to repair or replace potentially defective products 
estimated warranty costs are based upon prior actual warranty costs for substantially similar products 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data as a percentage of total revenues 
years ended june  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of acquired intangible assets total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  revenues by operating segment 
years ended june  defense electronics group deg imaging and visualization solutions group ivs oem solutions group osg momentum computer group mcg total revenues fiscal year vs 
fiscal year total revenues increased from million during fiscal year to million during fiscal year international revenues represented approximately of total revenues during both fiscal years and deg revenues increased or million to million during fiscal year  compared to during fiscal year the increase in deg revenues was primarily due to a million increase in shipments of sigint applications 
revenues from both radar and defense technology applications each increased by approximately over fiscal year levels 
radar applications accounted for of defense electronics revenues in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year signal intelligence sigint applications accounted for of deg revenues in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year defense technology applications accounted for of deg revenues in fiscal year and in fiscal year we expect defense electronics revenues to increase in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to increased demand for sigint applications 
ivs revenues increased or million to million during fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the increase in imaging and visualization solutions revenues was primarily due to a million increase in revenues from products used in mri imaging systems  a million increase in revenues from products using digital x ray technology and a million increase in revenues from tgs group  which was acquired in may we expect ivs revenues to increase in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to recent design wins and the acquisition of sohard  which was completed on july  osg revenues increased or million to million for fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year the increase in revenue was due primarily to increased shipments to semiconductor imaging oems for developing and testing of new semiconductor imaging systems as design wins moved to production 
shipments to customers in the semiconductor market represented approximately of osg revenues in fiscal year and increased by million to million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year mcg revenues were million during fiscal year and include revenues from mci from the acquisition date of december  through june  gross margin gross margin was for fiscal year  a decrease of basis points from the gross margin achieved during fiscal year the decrease in gross margin during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a revenue mix shift from deg towards osg and ivs as well as the acquisition of mcg  which generate lower margins than deg and increased inventory and warranty provisions 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million for fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year includes an increase of million of expenses relating to the operations of the tgs group  arc and mci acquisitions 
sales expenses unrelated to the acquired companies increased million while remaining at of revenue year over year 
general and administrative expenses unrelated to acquired companies increased by million  including million for professional services in connection with sarbanes oxley compliance efforts and other corporate initiatives 
selling  general and administrative headcount increased by employees not as a result of our acquisitions 
the fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses include a charge of million for acquired research and development resulting from the arc acquisition 
there were no charges for acquired research and development in fiscal year research and development research and development expenses increased by  or million  to million for fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an additional million of expenses relating to the research activities associated with the tgs group  arc and mci acquisitions  as well as an increase in prototype development expenses of approximately million and an increase in compensation expense from the increase in headcount of employees unrelated to our acquisitions 
research and development is important to our future success  and we expect that research and development expenses will increase in future periods 
amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets expense increased by  or million  to million for fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets expense in fiscal year year was primarily due to a full year of amortization from intangible assets acquired in the tgs group and arc acquisitions  which were completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and amortization of intangible assets acquired in the mci acquisition  which was completed on december  interest income interest income was million in fiscal year  up from million in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to higher rates of return and increased invested cash balances in  including million from convertible debt net proceeds raised in april interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal year  up million from million in fiscal year this increase was related to the increased interest expense associated with our million of convertible debt issued in april income tax provision our provision for income taxes was million during fiscal year  reflecting a tax rate  as compared to million during fiscal year  reflecting a tax rate 
the fiscal year and fiscal year tax rates are less than the us statutory rate of primarily due to research and development credits  tax exempt interest and the extraterritorial income eti benefit 
the increase in the tax rate to in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is primarily due to decreased tax benefits related to tax exempt interest income 
in the normal course of business  we and our subsidiaries are examined by various tax authorities  including the irs 
generally  an unfavorable settlement of any issue under audit would require the use of cash 
segment operating results income from operations of the deg segment increased million to million during fiscal year from million during fiscal year the increase in income from operations of the deg segment was primarily due to the million or increase in revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the impact of the revenue increase was partially offset by increases in deg operating expenses  including selling  general and administrative  research and development and amortization  which in the aggregate increased by million from fiscal year income from operations of the ivs segment increased million to million during fiscal year from million during fiscal year the increase in income from operations of the ivs segment in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to the million or increase in revenues in fiscal year the impact of the revenue increase was partially offset by increases in ivs s operating expenses  which in the aggregate increased by million from fiscal year income from operations of the osg segment was million during fiscal year as compared with a loss of million during fiscal year the improved results in the osg segment in fiscal year were primarily due to a million or increase in revenues from fiscal year the impact of the revenue increase was partially offset by increases in osg s operating expenses  which in the aggregate increased by million from fiscal year loss from operations of the mcg segment was million during fiscal year on sales of million 
mcg segment results are since the mci acquisition date of december   and include approximately million in amortization of acquired intangible assets 
see note n to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information regarding our operating segments 
fiscal year vs 
fiscal year total revenues increased from million during fiscal year to million during fiscal year international revenues represented approximately of total revenues during fiscal year compared with approximately of total revenues during fiscal year deg revenues increased or million to million during fiscal year  compared to during fiscal year the increase in deg revenues was primarily driven by a million increase in shipments of sigint applications  partially offset by a million decline in shipments of radar and defense technologies 
the decrease in shipments of radar and defense technologies applications was due to the timing of programs 
radar applications accounted for of defense electronics revenues in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year sigint applications accounted for of defense electronics revenues in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year defense technology applications accounted for of defense electronics revenues in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year ivs revenues decreased or million to million during fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in imaging and visualization solutions revenues was primarily due to a million decrease in revenues from products used in ct imaging systems  a decrease in sales that had been expected by us  partially offset by a million increase in other modalities including digital x ray and mri 
the reduction in revenues derived from ct imaging systems was due to introductions by customers of ct systems that do not contain our products 
the acquisition of tgs group contributed million of revenues in fiscal year osg revenues increased or million to million for fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year the increase in revenue was due primarily to increased shipments to semiconductor imaging oems for developing and testing of new semiconductor imaging systems as design wins moved to production 
shipments to semiconductors customers represented approximately of osg revenues in fiscal year and increased by million to million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross margin gross margin was for fiscal year  an increase of basis points from the gross margin achieved during fiscal year the increase in gross profit during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to program shifts within our deg revenues 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million for fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year the increase in the expenses was primarily due to the inclusion of tgs group and arc  which contributed million of expenses for fiscal year and million of increased professional services associated with sarbanes oxley compliance efforts  as well as a charge for acquired research and development of million resulting from the arc acquisition  offset by the absence in fiscal year of million expensed in fiscal year related to an arbitration award against us in a former employee matter 
research and development research and development expenses increased slightly by  or million  to million for fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased compensation and  higher prototype and development costs associated with several development programs  and the inclusion of tgs group and arc  which contributed million of expenses for fiscal year compared to none in the prior year  all of which were partially offset by the reduced compensation of terminating certain employees in the last quarter of fiscal year amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets expense increased by  or million  to million for fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets expense in fiscal year was due amortization from intangible assets acquired in the tgs group and arc acquisitions  which were completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year interest income we earned million in interest income during fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year this increase was primarily due to higher invested cash balances during fiscal year interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal year as compared with million in fiscal year the increase in interest expense was due to our issuance of million of convertible notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal year gain on sale of division we recorded a gain of million during fiscal year as the result of the sale of our shared storage business unit to ibm 
we received the final payments due from ibm for the sale of the shared storage business unit in march income taxes provision our provision for income taxes was million during fiscal year  reflecting a tax rate  as compared to million during fiscal year  reflecting a tax rate 
the fiscal year and fiscal year tax rates are less than the us statutory rate of primarily due to research and development credits  tax exempt interest and the eti benefit 
the decrease in the tax rate to in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is primarily due to increased tax benefits related to the eti benefit and research and development tax credits 
segment operating results income from operations of the deg segment increased million to million during fiscal year from million during fiscal year the increase in income from operations of the deg segment was primarily due to the increase in revenue from sigint applications  which generate a higher gross margin than do other applications 
income from operations of the ivs segment decreased million to million during fiscal year from million during fiscal year the decrease in income from operations of the ivs segment in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the decline in revenues as well as the increased operating expenses associated with the acquisition of tgs group during the fourth quarter of fiscal year loss from operations of the osg segment decreased million to million during fiscal year from million during fiscal year the decrease in loss from operations of the osg segment in fiscal year was primarily due to a million increase in revenues from fiscal year see note n to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information regarding our operating segments 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and marketable securities decreased by million to million as of june  as compared to million as of june  in fiscal year  we generated million in cash from operations compared to million generated in fiscal year the million increase in the amount of cash generated from operations during fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a million increase in net income  a million increase in non cash depreciation and amortization expenses and deferred income taxes

on july   our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to million of our currently outstanding common stock 
the plan is intended to offset the potential dilutive impact of the issuance of shares in connection with our employee stock option and purchase plans 
repurchases of our common stock may be made from time to time at management s discretion on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions 
the terms of our mortgage note agreements contain certain covenants  which  among other provisions  require us to maintain a minimum net worth 
the mortgage note agreements also include significant prepayment penalties

as a result of our adoption of emerging issue task force issue no 
eitf  the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share  we included  shares and  shares  which represent the securities issuable under our outstanding contingently convertible senior notes  in the calculation of diluted net income per share for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
in june  we entered into an alliance agreement with a third party to purchase certain computer equipment and services 
this alliance agreement is in effect until december and contains penalties for early termination and volume commitments 
aggregate minimum purchase commitments over the six year term of the agreement total approximately million  unless we terminate the agreement and pay penalties of up to million for early termination 
in july  we acquired sohard for approximately million in cash  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
sohard is a global market leader in the development of advanced software solutions for medical imaging systems  hardware and firmware for commercial embedded systems and software intelligence applications delivered via professional services 
sohard is headquartered in fuerth  germany 
on august   we purchased echotek for approximately million  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
the purchase was paid in a combination of cash and shares of mercury common stock  with such stock representing approximately of the total purchase price 
based in huntsville  alabama  echotek is a market leader in the development of data acquisition products 
the results of echotek s operations will be included in our consolidated operations beginning september the following is a schedule of our commitments and contractual obligations outstanding at june  in thousands total less than year years years more than years notes payable interest due on notes payable alliance agreement purchase obligations operating leases other long term liabilities deferred compensation currently  our prime source of liquidity comes from cash  marketable securities and cash generated from operations

we do not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures or any other material commitments aside from operating leases for our facilities  inventory purchase commitments  and commitments under our alliance agreement 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy working capital requirements  we may need to access funds through bank loans  sales of securities or other means 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us  on a timely basis or at all 
if we are unable to secure additional financing  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  respond to competition or continue to effectively operate our business 
based on our current plans and business conditions  we believe that existing cash and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
additional information on stock option plans and grants we currently have one active stock option plan under which we grant options the stock option plan 
in addition  we have several terminated stock option plans under which we no longer may grant options but under which we have options for the purchase of  shares still outstanding at june  our stock option grants are designed to reward employees for their long term contributions to us and provide incentives for them to remain with our company

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb announced that it had reached a final consensus with respect to emerging issue task force eitf  the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
the fasb s final consensus states that shares of common stock contingently issuable pursuant to contingent convertible securities should be included in diluted earnings per share computations if dilutive regardless of whether their market price triggers or other contingent features have been met 
eitf was effective for all periods ending after december  and required us to include an additional  shares  using the if converted method under which net income was also adjusted to exclude imputed interest expense  net of tax  in our computation of diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended june  the consensus required us to restate prior period earnings per share for comparative purposes 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs sfas 
sfas amends arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
this statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material  and requires those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued two staff positions  fsp fas and fsp fas  in response to the job creations act of under fsp fas  the fasb decided that the deduction for qualified domestic production activities should be accounted for as a special deduction under fas under fsp fas  the fasb addresses the appropriate point at which a company should reflect in its financial statements the effects of the one time tax benefit on the repatriation of foreign earnings 
the adoption of fsp fas and fsp fas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r replaces sfas and supersedes apb sfas r focuses primarily on the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
sfas r was originally expected to be effective for us beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year in april  the effective date was amended by the sec 
as a result  sfas r was effective for us as of july  accordingly  we adopted sfas r in our first quarter of fiscal year we expect to use the modified prospective transition method and will not restate prior periods for the adoption of sfas r 
although we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas r and its implications on our employee benefit plans  we believe that the adoption of this standard  based on the terms of the options outstanding at june   will have a material effect on our net income in fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
the principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates 
investments with interest rate risk include short term and long term marketable securities 
debt with interest rate risk includes our fixed rate convertible debt and mortgages 
in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk  a fluctuation in interest rates was assumed 
since the convertible debt was out of the money at the end of fiscal year  it was treated as a fixed rate debt security and the analysis assumes that the entire principal amount is repaid in full at maturity and the exercise of the embedded equity option is ignored 
market risk for the short term and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential decrease in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio 
on this basis  the potential loss in fair value from changes in interest rates is million as of june  the potential loss reflects a fair value loss on debt offset by a fair value gain on investments 
we currently expect to hold our debt to maturity or conversion  whichever is sooner 
therefore  the realization of the potential loss on the debt obligations is unlikely 
foreign currency risk we operate primarily in the united states 
in fiscal year  of our revenues were billed in us dollars 
however  an increasing portion of our business is conducted outside the united states through our foreign subsidiaries in the united kingdom  italy  germany  japan  the netherlands and france  where business is transacted in non us dollar currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in the exchange rates of these currencies 
local currencies are used as the functional currency for our subsidiaries in the united kingdom  france  italy  germany  the netherlands and japan 
consequently  changes in the exchange rates of the currencies may impact the translation of the foreign subsidiaries statements of operations into us dollars  which may in turn affect our consolidated statement of operations 
the impact of the movements in foreign currency exchange rates has been immaterial for all periods 
we have not entered into any financial derivatives instruments that expose us to material market risk  including any instruments designed to hedge the impact of foreign currency exposures 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships

we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use  or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate
