the activities of mergence from august  are included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements which appear elsewhere herein for more detailed financial information on the acquisition of mergence 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company introduced a subscription sales model for the sale of its enterprise products 
the company continues to offer its enterprise products through the sale of perpetual licenses and introduced the subscription pricing model to allow customers to begin using the company s products at a lower initial cost of software acquisition 
subscriptions automatically renew unless terminated with days notice 
during fiscal and fiscal  revenues under the subscription model were not significant  however  customer interest in the model and sales under the model have been increasing 
critical accounting policies in the preparation of financial statements and other financial data  management applies certain accounting policies to transactions that  depending on choices made by management  can result in different outcomes 
in order for a reader to understand the following information regarding the financial performance and condition of the company  an understanding of those accounting policies is important 
the policies that the company believes are most important for a reader s understanding of the financial information provided in this report are described below 
revenue recognition  allowance for bad debts and returns reserve the company has two types of software product offerings enterprise software and desktop and server software 
enterprise software products are generally sold directly to end users 
the company sells its desktop and server software products directly to end users and through distributors and resellers 
sales to distributors and resellers accounted for approximately  and  of total sales for fiscal years  and  respectively 
revenue from the sale of all software products is generally recognized at the time of shipment  provided there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection is considered probable  persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists and there are no significant obligations remaining 
both types of the company s software product offerings are off the shelf as such term is defined by statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition 
the company s software products can be installed and used by customers on their own with little or no customization required 
multi user licenses marketed by the company are sold as a right to use the number of licenses and license fee revenue is recognized upon delivery of all software required to satisfy the number of licenses sold 
upon delivery  the licensing fee is payable without further delivery obligations of the company 
desktop and server software products are generally not sold in multiple element arrangements 
accordingly  the price paid by the customer is considered the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for those products 
enterprise software sales are generally multiple element arrangements which include software license deliverables  professional services and post contract customer support 
in such multiple element arrangements  the company applies the residual method in determining revenue to be allocated to a software license 
in applying the residual method  the company deducts from the sale proceeds the vsoe of fair value of the services and post contract customer support in determining the residual fair value of the software license 
the vsoe of fair value of the services and post contract customer support is based on the amounts charged for these elements when sold separately 
professional services include implementation  integration  training and consulting services with revenue recognized as the services are performed 
these services are generally delivered on a time and materials basis  are billed on a current basis as the work is performed  and do not involve modification or customization of the software or any other unusual acceptance clauses or terms 
post contract customer support is typically provided under a maintenance agreement which provides technical support and rights to unspecified software maintenance updates and bug fixes on a when and if available basis 
revenue from post contract customer support services is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period generally one year 
such deferred amounts are recorded as part of deferred revenue in the company s consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere herein 
the company also sells its enterprise software using a subscription model 
at the time a customer enters into a binding agreement to purchase a subscription  the customer is invoiced for an initial day service period and an account receivable and deferred revenue are recorded 
beginning on the date the software is installed at the customer site and available for use by the customer  and provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition are met  the deferred revenue amount is recognized ratably over the period the service is provided 
the customer is then invoiced every days and revenue is recognized ratably over the period the service is provided 
subscriptions can be cancelled by the customer at any time by providing days written notice 
the company s software products are sold under warranty against certain defects in material and workmanship for a period of to days from the date of purchase 
certain software products  including desktop versions of monarch  monarch data pump  and vortexml sold directly to end users  include a guarantee under which such customers may return products within to days for a full refund 
additionally  the company provides its distributors with stock balancing rights and applies the guidance found in sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
revenue from the sale of software products to distributors and resellers is recognized at the time of shipment providing all other criteria for revenue recognition as stated above are met and i the distributor or reseller is unconditionally obligated to pay for the products  including no contingency as to product resale  ii the distributor or reseller has independent economic substance apart from the company  iii the company is not obligated for future performance to bring about product resale  and iv the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
the company s experience and history with its distributors and resellers allows for reasonable estimates of future returns 
among other things  estimates of potential future returns are made based on the inventory levels at the various distributors and resellers  which the company monitors frequently 
once the estimates of potential future returns from all sources are made  the company determines if it has adequate returns reserves to cover anticipated returns and the returns reserve is adjusted as required 
adjustments are recorded as increases or decreases in revenue in the period of adjustment 
actual returns have historically been within the range estimated by the company 
the company s returns reserve was  and  for the period ended as of september  and  respectively 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the company analyzes accounts receivable and the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
based upon the analysis and estimates of the uncollectibility of its accounts receivable  the company records an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
actual results could differ from the allowances for doubtful accounts recorded  and this difference may have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  for the period ended as of september  and  respectively 
deferred tax assets the company has deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that expire at different times through and until  as well as book and tax temporary differences 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
factors such as future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  changes in enacted tax rates and the period over which the company s deferred tax assets will be recoverable are considered in making these determinations 
the company s domestic operations have been profitable during the past three years while international operations have continued to generate operating losses 
during fiscal  the company increased sales and marketing expense by approximately and introduced a subscription sales model  both of which could have an adverse effect on profitability 
accordingly  management does not believe the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized and a full valuation allowance continues to be provided against these net deferred tax assets 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and  if current economic conditions change or future results of operations are better than expected  future assessments may result in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are realizable 
if this conclusion were reached  the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets would be reduced resulting in a tax benefit being recorded for financial reporting purposes 
total net deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance was approximately million as of september  capitalized software development costs the company capitalizes certain software development costs as well as purchased software upon achieving technological feasibility of the related products 
software development costs incurred and software purchased prior to achieving technological feasibility are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
commencing upon initial product release  capitalized costs are amortized to the cost of software licenses using the straight line method over the estimated life which approximates the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  generally to months 
the company s capitalized software was  and  for the period ended as of september  and  respectively 
goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets the company performs an evaluation of whether goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired annually or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
our annual impairment analysis is performed each may of the applicable fiscal year 
fair value is determined using market comparables for similar businesses or forecasts of discounted future cash flows 
the company also reviews other intangible assets and other long lived assets when an indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets 
should the fair value of the company s long lived assets decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  a charge to operations for impairment may be necessary 
no impairment charges were taken during fiscal accounting for stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the company s policy is to grant options with an exercise price equal to the estimated fair value of the company s stock on the grant date 
the company provides additional pro forma disclosures as required under statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
under apb opinion no 
 compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  on the date of the grant  between the estimated fair value of the company s stock and the exercise price

the company further agreed to indemnify the sellers of mergence and hold them harmless for any damages incurred or suffered arising out of any misrepresentation or breach of such warranties made by the company in the agreement 
the company believes that no such misrepresentations or breaches of warranty exist  or are likely to exist in the future  and  accordingly  has recorded no liabilities related to such indemnification 
the company enters into indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business 
pursuant to these agreements  the company agrees to indemnify  hold harmless  and reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party  generally its customers  in connection with any patent  copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to the company s products

the company has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of september  liquidity and capital resources the company had net income of approximately  for the year ended september  as compared to net income of approximately  and  respectively  for the years ended september  and during the years ended september   and  approximately  and  cash was provided by the company s operations  respectively 
during fiscal year  the main source of cash from operations was net income before depreciation and amortization 
net operating cash flow was reduced by cash payments made in fiscal for accrued expenses and accounts payable recorded in fiscal related to accounting fees  legal fees and year end bonus amounts 
net operating cash flow was also reduced by an increase in the accounts receivable balances  due to the timing of invoicing and cash collections at year end 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended september  of  is primarily the result of the purchase of fixed assets such as computer hardware and software  the purchase of new telecommunication equipment for the us facility and the cash outlay for the security deposit on the new sublease 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended september  of  is related to cash received from the exercise of employee stock options 
during fiscal  the company introduced a subscription sales model for the sale of its enterprise products 
this new pricing model allows customers to begin using the company s products at a lower initial cost of software acquisition when compared to the more traditional perpetual license sale 
while this initiative is designed to increase the number of enterprise solutions sold and also reduce dependency on short term sales by building a recurring revenue stream  it introduces increased risks for the company primarily associated with the timing of revenue recognition and reduced cash flows 
the subscription model delays revenue recognition when compared to the typical perpetual license sale and also  as the company allows termination of certain subscriptions with days notice  could result in decreased revenue for solutions sold under the model if the company experiences a high percentage of subscription cancellations during the first two years of the subscription 
further  as amounts due from customers are invoiced over the life of the subscription  there are delayed cash flows from subscription sales when compared to perpetual license sales 
the mergence purchase agreement includes a provision for quarterly cash payments to the former mergence shareholders equal to of revenue  as defined  of the datawatch researcher product for a period of six years  but not all mergence products are subject to royalties 
as the cash payments are based on recognized revenue and no minimum payments are required  they are not expected to have a significant impact on the company s liquidity or cash flows 
see the section titled off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments included elsewhere herein for a more complete disclosure of the company s commitments and contingent liabilities 
an existing agreement between datawatch and math strategies grants the company exclusive worldwide rights to use and distribute certain intellectual property owned by math strategies and incorporated by the company in its monarch  monarch data pump  vortexml and certain other products 
in april  the company entered into an option purchase agreement with math strategies giving the company the option to purchase these intellectual property rights for million 
this option  if exercised  would provide the company with increased flexibility to utilize the purchased technology in the future 
the option can be exercised by datawatch at any time during the two years following the effective date of the option purchase agreement 
management believes that its current cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s cash needs for working capital and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
the company currently anticipates approximately  of cash requirements  during that time  to fund capital expenditures for the new us facility 
the company does not currently anticipate cash requirements to fund significant growth or the acquisition of complementary technology or businesses 
however  if in the future  such expenditures are anticipated or required  the company may need to seek additional financing by issuing equity or obtaining credit facilities to fund such requirements 
management believes that the company s current operations have not been materially impacted by the effects of inflation

the statement requires entities to recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
on april   the securities and exchange commission adopted a rule amending sfas r share based payment deferring the effective date of sfas r for public companies to fiscal years beginning after june  the company will be required to adopt sfas r beginning october  for new awards of stock based compensation granted after that date 
at september   all outstanding options were fully vested  therefore management does not anticipate future compensation expense  related to existing options or future option grants  to be significant under sfas r 
future grants of stock based awards will be recorded at fair value in the financial statements 
risk factors the company does not provide forecasts of its future financial performance 
however  from time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements contained in this annual report on form k that are not historical facts including  but not limited to statements contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of part ii of this annual report on form k relating to liquidity and capital resources may constitute forward looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date they are made 
the company disclaims any obligation  except as specifically required by law and the rules of the securities and exchange commission  to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in the company s expectations or in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based  or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
the company s actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and may in the future vary significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  without limitation  the risks  uncertainties and other information discussed below and within this annual report on form k  as well as the accuracy of the company s internal estimates of revenue and operating expense levels 
the following discussion of the company s risk factors should be read in conjunction with the financial statements contained herein and related notes thereto 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
subscription sales model risk during fiscal  the company introduced a subscription sales model for the sale of its enterprise products 
this new pricing model allows customers to begin using the company s products at a lower initial cost of software acquisition when compared to the more traditional perpetual license sale 
while this initiative is designed to increase the number of enterprise solutions sold and also reduce dependency on short term sales by building a recurring revenue stream  it introduces increased risks for the company primarily associated with the timing of revenue recognition and reduced cash flows 
the subscription model delays revenue recognition when compared to the typical perpetual license sale and also  as the company allows termination of certain subscriptions with days notice  could result in decreased revenue for solutions sold under the model if the company experiences a high percentage of subscription cancellations during the first two years of the subscription 
further  as amounts due from customers are invoiced over the life of the subscription  there are delayed cash flows from subscription sales when compared to perpetual license sales 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company s future operating results could vary substantially from quarter to quarter because of uncertainties and or risks associated with such things as technological change  competition  and delays in the introduction of products or product enhancements and general market trends 
historically  the company has operated with little backlog of orders because its software products are generally shipped as orders are received 
as a result  net sales in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
further  the company s introduction of the subscription sales model could result in decreased revenues over the short term 
because the company s staffing and operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s costs are fixed in the short term  small variations in the timing of revenues can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
because of these factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such variations in operating results in the future or that such variations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operation 
weakening of world wide economic conditions and the computer software market may result in lower revenue growth rates or decreased revenues the revenue growth and profitability of the company s business depends on the overall demand for computer software and services  particularly in the markets in which it competes 
because the company s sales are primarily to major corporate customers  its business also depends on general economic and business conditions 
a softening of demand for computer software and services caused by a weakening of the economy in the united states or abroad  may result in lower revenue growth rates  decreased revenues and reduced profitability 
in addition  terrorist attacks against the united states  and the united states military response to these attacks have added to economic and political uncertainty which may adversely affect worldwide demand for computer software and services and result in significant fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies 
in a weakened economy  the company cannot be assured that it will be able to effectively promote future growth in its software and services revenues or maintain profitability 
dependence on principal products in the year ended september   monarch  datawatch es and visual qsm and visual hd accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 
the company is wholly dependent on the monarch  datawatch es  visual qsm  visual hd and the recently acquired datawatch researcher and imergence products 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting sales of any of these products could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s future financial performance will depend in part on the successful introduction of its new and enhanced versions of these products and development of new versions of these and other products and subsequent acceptance of such new and enhanced products 
in addition  competitive pressures or other factors may result in significant price erosion that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
international sales in the year ended september   and  international sales  including export sales from domestic operations  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of its total revenue 
a significant portion of the company s total revenue will therefore be subject to risks associated with international sales  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  changes in tariffs  exchange rates and other barriers  political and economic instability  possible effects of war and acts of terrorism  difficulties in account receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in protecting the company s intellectual property overseas  seasonality of sales and potentially adverse tax consequences 
acquisition strategy as evidenced by its august acquisition of mergence technologies corporation and its october acquisition of auxilor inc  the company continues to address the need to develop new products  in part  through the acquisition of other companies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
achieving and maintaining the anticipated benefits of an acquisition will depend in part upon whether the integration of the companies business is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner  and there can be no assurance that this will occur 
the successful combination of companies in the high technology industry may be more difficult to accomplish than in other industries 
dependence on new introductions  new product delays growth in the company s business depends in substantial part on the continuing introduction of new products 
the length of product life cycles depends in part on end user demand for new or additional functionality in the company s products 
if the company fails to accurately anticipate the demand for  or encounters any significant delays in developing or introducing  new products or additional functionality on its products  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business 
product life cycles can also be affected by the introduction by suppliers of operating systems of comparable functionality within their products 
the failure of the company to anticipate the introduction of additional functionality in products developed by such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  the company s competitors may introduce products with more features and lower prices than the company s products 
such increase in competition could adversely affect the life cycles of the company s products  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
software products may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential end users  errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
rapid technological change the markets in which the company competes have undergone  and can be expected to continue to undergo  rapid and significant technological change 
the ability of the company to grow will depend on its ability to successfully update and improve its existing products and market and license new products to meet the changing demands of the marketplace and that can compete successfully with the existing and new products of the company s competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully anticipate and satisfy the changing demands of the personal computer software marketplace  that the company will be able to continue to enhance its product offerings  or that technological changes in hardware platforms or software operating systems  or the introduction of a new product by a competitor  will not render the company s products obsolete 
competition in the pc software industry the software market for personal computers is highly competitive and characterized by continual change and improvement in technology 
several of the company s existing and potential competitors  including bmc software  actuate corporation  mobius management systems  inc  and others  have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources than the company 
no assurance can be given that the company will have the resources required to compete successfully in the future 
dependence on proprietary software technology the company s success is dependent upon proprietary software technology 
although the company does not own all patents on any such technology  it does hold exclusive licenses to such technology and relies principally on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect its rights to such proprietary technology 
despite such precautions  there can be no assurance that such steps will be adequate to deter misappropriation of such technology 
reliance on software license agreements substantially all of the company s products incorporate third party proprietary technology which is generally licensed to the company on an exclusive  worldwide basis 
failure by such third parties to continue to develop technology for the company and license such technology to the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
dependence on the ability to hire and retain skilled personnel qualified personnel are in great demand throughout the software industry 
the company s success depends  in large part  upon its ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled employees  particularly  technical personnel and product development and professional services personnel  sales and marketing personnel and other senior personnel 
the company s failure to attract and retain the highly trained technical personnel that are integral to the company s product development  professional services and direct sales teams may limit the rate at which the company can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements 
a change in key management could result in transition and attrition in the affected department 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
indirect distribution channels the company sells a significant portion of its products through resellers  none of which are under the direct control of the company 
the loss of major resellers of the company s products  or a significant decline in their sales  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract or retain additional qualified resellers or that any such resellers will be able to effectively sell the company s products 
the company seeks to select and retain resellers on the basis of their business credentials and their ability to add value through expertise in specific vertical markets or application programming expertise 
in addition  the company relies on resellers to provide post sales service and support  and any deficiencies in such service and support could adversely affect the company s business 
volatility of stock price as is frequently the case with the stocks of high technology companies  the market price of the company s common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile 
factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  increased competition  the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  expenses or other difficulties associated with assimilating companies acquired by the company  changes in the mix of sales channels  the timing of significant customer orders  and macroeconomic conditions generally  may have a significant impact on the market price of the stock of the company 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from the levels anticipated by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock in any given period 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which  on occasion  have appeared to be unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments at september   the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments  or other financial and commodity instruments 
the company holds no investment securities that possess significant market risk 
primary market risk exposures the company s primary market risk exposure is currency exchange rate risk 
international revenues and expenses are generally transacted by the company s foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are denominated in local currency 
approximately  and of the company s revenues for  and  respectively  were from foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  approximately  and of the company s expenses for fiscal  and  respectively  were from foreign subsidiaries 
the company s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that the operations of its international subsidiaries are almost exclusively conducted in their respective local currencies  and dollar advances to the company s international subsidiaries  if any  are usually considered to be of a long term investment nature 
therefore  the majority of currency movements are reflected in the company s other comprehensive income 
there are  however  certain situations where the company will invoice customers in currencies other than its own 
such gains or losses from operating activity  whether realized or unrealized  are reflected in other income expense  net in our consolidated statement of operations 
these have not been material in the past nor does management believe that they will be material in the future 
currently the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
