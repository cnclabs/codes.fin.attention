sales 
our sales are primarily derived from the sale of collectible  toy and infant products and are recognized upon transfer of title of product to our customers 
we market our products through a variety of distribution channels  including chain retailers  specialty and hobby wholesalers and retailers  oem dealers  corporate promotional accounts and direct to consumers 
for the years ended december   and  sales to chain retailers comprised  and  respectively  of our net sales 
our products are marketed and distributed in north america  europe  australia and asia pacific 
international sales constituted  and of our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect international sales to increase over the next several years as we expand our geographic reach 
our net sales have not been materially impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
we derive a significant portion of our sales from some of the world s largest retailers and oem dealers 
our top five customers accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
toys r us babies r us  our largest customer  accounted for of total net sales in wal mart accounted for and of total net sales in and  respectively 
the john deere dealer network accounted for of total net sales in other than wal mart and the john deere dealer network  no customer accounted for more than of our total net sales in in  other than wal mart  no customer accounted for more than of our total net sales 
in  other than toys r us babies r us  no customer accounted for more than of our total net sales 
we provide certain customers the option to take delivery of our products either in the united states  united kingdom  australia  canada or germany with credit terms generally ranging from to days or directly in china with payment made by irrevocable letter of credit or wire transfer 
we generally grant price discounts of to on direct sales from china resulting in lower gross margins 
however  shipments direct from china lower our distribution and administrative costs  so we believe that our operating income margin is comparable for products delivered in china versus products shipped in the united states  united kingdom  australia  canada or germany 
for the years ended december   and  direct sales from china constituted  and  respectively  of our net sales 
we do not ordinarily sell our products on consignment  and we ordinarily accept returns only for defective merchandise 
in certain instances  where retailers are unable to resell the quantity of products that they have purchased from us  we may  in accordance with industry practice  assist retailers in selling such excess inventory by offering credits and other price concessions  which are typically evaluated and issued annually 
returns and allowances on an annual basis have ranged from to of net sales over the last three years 
expenses 
our products are manufactured by third parties  principally located in china 
cost of sales primarily consists of purchases of finished products  which accounted for  and of our cost of sales in  and  respectively 
the remainder of our cost of sales primarily includes tooling depreciation  freight in from suppliers and concept and design expenses 
substantially all of our purchases of finished products from the far east are denominated in hong kong dollars  and therefore  subject to currency fluctuations 
historically  we have not incurred substantial exposure due to currency fluctuations because the hong kong government has maintained a policy of linking the hong kong dollar and us dollar since a future increase in the value of the hong kong dollar relative to the us dollar may increase our cost of sales and decrease our gross margins 
additionally  if our suppliers experience increased raw materials  labor or other costs and pass along such cost increases to us through higher prices for finished goods  our cost of sales would increase  and to the extent we are unable to pass such price increases along to our customers  our gross margins would decrease 
our quarterly gross margins can also be affected by the mix of product that is shipped during each quarter 
while all of our product categories approximated a similar gross margin prior to  individual product lines within a category carried gross margins that varied significantly and caused quarterly fluctuations  based on the timing of individual shipments throughout the year 
prior to  our gross margins on an annual basis historically fell within the general range of to 
however  due to the acquisition of tfy  which has higher sales of non licensed products that carry lower selling prices and gross margins than the company has had historically  we anticipate our annual gross margins will now fall in the range of to 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of royalties  employee compensation  advertising and marketing expenses  freight out to customers and sales commissions 
royalties vary by product category and are generally paid on a quarterly basis 
multiple royalties may be paid to various licensors on a single product 
in  aggregate royalties by product ranged from approximately to of our net sales price 
royalty expense was approximately  and of our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales commissions ranged from approximately to of the net sales price and are paid quarterly to our external sales representative organizations 
sales subject to commissions represented  and of our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales commission expense was of our net sales for the years ended december   and seasonality 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  substantial fluctuations in our quarterly net sales and operating results  which is typical of many companies in our industry 
our business is highly seasonal due to high customer demand for our products during the year end holiday season 
approximately  of our net sales for the three years ended december   were generated in the second half of the year

other allowances can also be issued for defective merchandise  volume programs and co op advertising 
all allowances are accrued throughout the year  as sales are recorded 
the allowances are based on the terms of the various programs in effect  however  management also takes into consideration historical trends and specific customer and product information when making its estimates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate risk associated with the company s credit agreement and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the company s foreign operations 
the company s credit agreement prior to april required that the company maintain an interest rate protection agreement 
effective june   the company entered into an interest rate collar transaction covering million of its debt  with a cap based on day libor rates of and a floor of 
the agreement  which had quarterly settlement dates  expired on june  during  the company paid approximately  which is included in interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december  additionally  a benefit of approximately  was recorded in net interest expense related to the change in fair value of the company s interest rate collar during the year ended december  based on the company s interest rate exposure on variable rate borrowings at december   a one percentage point increase in average interest rates on the company s borrowings would increase future interest expense by approximately  per month and a five percentage point increase would increase future interest expense by approximately  per month 
the company determined these amounts based on approximately million of variable rate borrowings at december   multiplied by and  respectively  and divided by since the expiration of the collar transaction described in the preceding paragraph  the company has not used any interest rate collars  hedges or other derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce interest rate risk 
as a result  any increase in interest rates on the company s variable rate borrowings would increase interest expense and reduce net income 
the company s net sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  except for a small amount of net sales denominated in uk pounds  australian dollars  euros and canadian dollars 
the company s purchases of finished goods from chinese manufacturers are primarily denominated in hong kong dollars 
expenses for these manufacturers are primarily denominated in chinese renminbi 
the hong kong dollar and the chinese renminbi are currently pegged to the us dollar 
if the hong kong dollar and the chinese renminbi ceased to be pegged to the us dollar  a material increase in the value of the hong kong dollar or the chinese renminbi relative to the us dollar or the uk pound would increase our expenses and therefore could adversely affect our profitability 
a change in the exchange rate of the us dollar with respect to the hong kong dollar for the year ended december  would have changed the total dollar amount of our gross profit by approximately 
a change in the exchange rate of the us dollar with respect to the uk pound  the australian dollar  the euro or the canadian dollar for the year ended december  would not have had a significant impact on the company s earnings 
the company is also subject to exchange rate risk relating to transfers of funds denominated in uk pounds  australian dollars  canadian dollars or euros from its foreign subsidiaries to the united states 
historically  the company has not used hedges or other derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce exchange rate risk
