item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors the following describes certain of the risks and uncertainties faced by the company that could cause its future results to differ materially from its current results and from those anticipated in its forward looking statements 
these risk factors should be considered together with the other risks and uncertainties described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere herein 
the cyclical nature of the aluminum industry causes variability in the company s earnings and cash flows 
the company s operating results depend on the market for primary aluminum  which is a cyclical commodity affected by global demand and supply conditions 
historically  global demand and prices for primary aluminum have fluctuated in part due to economic and market conditions in the united states and other major global economies  as well as currency fluctuations 
the relative pricing of other materials  such as steel  plastic and glass  which are used as alternatives for aluminum in some applications  also affects demand for aluminum 
certain aluminum end use markets  including the automotive sector and the building and construction sector  are also cyclical 
when downturns occur in these sectors  demand for primary aluminum decreases resulting in lower prices for the company s products 
over the past twenty years  the average annual cash price for primary aluminum on the lme was per pound and has ranged from a low of per pound in to a high of per pound in the average lme price was per pound for the year ended december  and per pound for the year ended december  primary aluminum prices could decline below current levels  reducing the company s earnings and cash flows 
a prolonged downturn in prices for primary aluminum could significantly reduce the amount of cash available to the company to meet its current obligations and fund its long term business strategies 
conversely  if prices increase  certain of the company s hedging transactions  including its lme based alumina contracts  may limit the company s ability to take advantage of the increased prices 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has reduced its casting and shipping costs by selling molten aluminum to the major customers of its ravenswood and hawesville facilities  the loss of one of these major customers would increase its production costs at those facilities 
a combined total of of the company s consolidated net sales for were derived from sales to pechiney rolled products  llc and southwire company 
pechiney was acquired by alcan in february pechiney s facility is located adjacent to the ravenswood facility and southwire s facility is located adjacent to the hawesville facility 
due to this proximity  the company is able to deliver molten aluminum to these customers  thereby eliminating the company s casting and shipping costs and its customers remelting costs 
the company has long term contracts with pechiney and southwire which are due to expire at the end of and at the end of  respectively 
the company has entered into a new contract for the supply of power to the ravenswood facility that would extend the pechiney contract through july  the new power contract is subject to certain approvals by the public service commission of west virginia 
see item  facilities and production ravenswood facility 
pechiney has the right to reduce its purchases under its contract by  upon months notice  and southwire has the right to reduce purchases under its contract by beginning in the company may be unable to extend or replace these contracts when they terminate 
if the company is unable to renew these contracts when they expire  or if either customer 
table of contents significantly reduces its purchases under those contracts  the company will incur higher casting and shipping costs 
a material change in the company s relationship with glencore could affect how it purchases raw materials  sell its products and hedge its exposure to metal price risk 
the company benefits from its relationship with glencore international ag  its largest shareholder 
the company has entered into various long term contracts with glencore to sell up to of its current annual primary aluminum production and to purchase up to of its annual alumina requirements under contracts expiring at various dates from through in addition  the company has entered into an alumina tolling agreement with glencore for million pounds of the expansion capacity at the nordural facility 
the company also enters into forward sales and hedging contracts with glencore  which helps the company manage its exposure to fluctuating aluminum prices 
because glencore is a major customer  supplier and metal hedge counterparty  a material change in the company s relationship with glencore  including any significant change in its investment in the company  could affect how the company purchases raw materials  sells its products and hedges its exposure to metal price risk  which could impact the company s operating costs 
losses caused by disruptions in the supply of power would reduce the profitability of the company s operations 
the company may incur losses due to a temporary or prolonged interruption of the supply of electrical power to its facilities  which can be caused by unusually high demand  blackouts  equipment failure  natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
large amounts of electricity are used to produce primary aluminum  and any loss of power which causes an equipment shutdown can result in the hardening or freezing of molten aluminum in the pots where it is produced 
if this occurs  the company may lose production for a prolonged period of time and incur significant losses 
although the company maintains property and business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from catastrophic events  it may be required to pay significant amounts under the deductible provisions of those insurance policies 
in addition  the coverage under those policies may not be sufficient to cover all losses  or may not cover certain events 
certain of the company s insurance policies do not cover any losses that may be incurred if the company s suppliers are unable to provide power during periods of unusually high demand 
certain losses which are not covered by insurance may trigger a default under the company s revolving credit facility 
changes or disruptions to the company s current supply arrangements could increase its raw material costs 
the company depends on a limited number of suppliers for alumina  the principal raw material used to produce primary aluminum 
supply of alumina has been constrained over the past two years  and the construction of new production facilities requires substantial lead time 
disruptions to the company s supply of alumina could occur for a variety of reasons  including disruptions of production at a particular supplier s alumina refinery 
these disruptions may require the company to purchase alumina on less favorable terms than under its current agreements 
spot alumina prices are currently substantially higher than the prices the company pays under its long term agreements 
the company and noranda finance inc  through joint venture companies  recently purchased the gramercy  louisiana alumina refinery that supplies the alumina used at the company s hawesville and noranda s new madrid primary aluminum production facilities 
as part of the acquisition  the joint venture also purchased an interest in a jamaican partnership that owns bauxite mining assets in st 
ann  jamaica 
bauxite is the principal raw material used in the production of alumina and all of the bauxite used at the gramercy alumina refinery is purchased from the jamaican partnership 
in october  certain equipment used by the partnership to load bauxite at the st 
ann port facility failed  resulting in a temporary interruption of bauxite shipments 
the st 
ann port facility  which is used to ship bauxite to the gramercy alumina facility and to other customers  operated at a reduced shipping level until full operations resumed in december 
table of contents if there is a significant disruption of bauxite shipments in the future  the joint venture could incur additional costs if it is required to use bauxite from other sources 
the cost of alumina used at the hawesville facility may be higher than under the company s previous lme based contract depending on certain market conditions 
the gramercy refinery that the company and noranda recently acquired from kaiser supplies all of the alumina used at the company s hawesville facility 
prior to the acquisition  the company purchased alumina from kaiser under a long term contract at prices based on the lme price for primary aluminum 
following the acquisition  that contract was replaced with a contract that provides for alumina prices based on the gramercy refinery s production costs 
as a result  the price the company pays for the alumina used at its hawesville facility is now based on the cost of alumina production  rather than the lme price for primary aluminum 
those production costs could be materially higher than the price paid under the company previous lme based contract during periods when aluminum prices are low and natural gas prices are high 
changes in the relative cost of certain raw materials and energy compared to the price of primary aluminum could affect the company s operating results 
the company s operating results are sensitive to changes in the price of primary aluminum and the raw materials used in its production 
although the company attempts to mitigate the effects of such price fluctuations through the use of various fixed price commitments and financial instruments  these efforts may limit its ability to take advantage of favorable changes in the market prices for primary aluminum or raw materials 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk electricity represents the company s single largest operating cost 
as a result  the availability of electricity at affordable prices is crucial to the profitability of the company s operations 
while the company purchases primarily all of its electricity for its existing us facilities under fixed price contracts through  a portion of the contracted cost of the electricity supplied to the mt 
holly facility varies with supplier s fuel costs 
an increase in these fuel costs would increase the price the mt 
holly facility pays for electricity 
the fixed price portions of the company s current power contracts are due to expire at various times from the end of through the company has entered into a new power contract with appalachian power company for the supply of power to the ravenswood facility beginning january  that agreement  which must be affirmed by the public services commission of west virginia  would have an initial term of years and continue thereafter until the company gives months notice of cancellation 
if the company is unable to obtain power at affordable rates upon the expiration of its contracts  the company may be forced to curtail or idle a portion of its production capacity  which would lower its revenues and adversely affect the profitability of its operations 
the company is subject to the risk of union disputes 
the bargaining unit employees at the company s ravenswood and hawesville facilities and at the gramercy refinery are represented by the united steel workers of america 
the company s labor contracts expire in at the ravenswood and hawesville facilities and in at the gramercy plant 
nordural s employees are represented by unions and were employed under a contract that expired at the end of new labor contracts are being negotiated to replace the recently expired contracts covering employees at nordural and the jamaican bauxite mining operations 
the company may be unable to satisfactorily renegotiate those labor contracts 
in addition  existing labor contracts may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at any of these facilities in the future  and any such work stoppage could prevent or significantly impair the company s ability to conduct production operations at those facilities 
the company depends on key management personnel 
the company s management structure is streamlined and  as a result  it relies heavily on a small core senior management team 
the unexpected loss of the services of one or more key employees could significantly harm the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the employment agreements for certain key management personnel expire at the end of and it is anticipated that one or more of those individuals may retire at that time 

table of contents the company is subject to a variety of environmental laws that could result in costs or liabilities 
the company is obligated to comply with various federal  state and other environmental laws and regulations  including the environmental laws and regulations of iceland  the european economic area and jamaica 
environmental laws and regulations may expose the company to costs or liabilities relating to its manufacturing operations or property ownership 
the company incurs operating costs and capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
in addition  the company is currently and may in the future be responsible for the cleanup of contamination at some of its current and former manufacturing facilities or for the amelioration of damage to natural resources 
for example  the company  along with others  including former owners of the company s former st 
croix facility  received notice of a threatened lawsuit alleging natural resources damages at the facility 
while it is not presently possible to determine the outcome of this matter  the company s known liabilities with respect to this and other matters relating to compliance and cleanup  based on current information  are not expected to be material and should not materially adversely affect the company s operating results 
however  if more stringent compliance or cleanup standards under environmental laws or regulations are imposed  previously unknown environmental conditions or damages to natural resources are discovered  or if contributions from other responsible parties with respect to sites for which the company has cleanup responsibilities are not available  the company may be subject to additional liability  which may be material 
further  additional environmental matters for which the company may be liable may arise in the future at its present sites where no problem is currently known  with respect to sites previously owned or operated by the company  by related corporate entities or by its predecessors  or at sites that the company may acquire in the future 
overall production costs may become prohibitively expensive and prevent the company from effectively competing in price sensitive markets if future capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance or cleanup are significantly greater than current or projected expenditures and costs 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources environmental expenditures and other contingencies and note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of the company s environmental matters and associated costs and risks 
acquisitions may present difficulties for the company 
in april  the company acquired the nordural facility  which is located in grundartangi  iceland 
in october  the company acquired a joint venture interest in an alumina refinery located in gramercy  louisiana and a interest in related bauxite operations in jamaica 
the company may make other strategic acquisitions in the future 
the company is subject to numerous risks as a result of its acquisitions  including the following it may be difficult for the company to manage its existing business as it integrates acquired operations  the company may not achieve the anticipated reductions in average unit production costs as a result of its acquisitions  and management of acquisitions will require continued development of financial controls and information systems  which may prove to be expensive  time consuming  and difficult 
accordingly  the company s recent or future acquisitions might not improve the company s competitive position and business prospects as anticipated 
the company may not realize the expected benefits of the planned expansion of the nordural facility 
the ongoing expansion of the company s nordural facility  which is expected to be completed in late  will more than double the facility s existing production capacity 
the expected benefits of the expansion may not be realized if nordural is unable to complete the expansion in the time forecast or experiences significant cost overruns 
the company may add additional capacity to the current expansion project or in a future expansion of the nordural facility 
in each case  the company s ability to add the additional capacity depends on its ability to enter into certain key contracts for that capacity 

table of contents operating in foreign countries exposes the company to political  regulatory  currency and other related risks the nordural facility is the company s first facility located outside of the united states 
the bauxite operations related to the gramercy plant  which the company recently acquired through a joint venture with noranda  are located in jamaica 
the company may in the future consider other acquisitions in foreign countries 
international operations may expose the company to risks  including unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations  political and economic instability  challenges in managing foreign operations  increased cost to adapt the company s systems and practices to those used in foreign countries  export duties  tariffs and other trade barriers  and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
in addition  the company will be exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and  as a result  an increase in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could increase its operating expenses which are denominated and payable in those currencies 
for example  nordural s revenues are denominated in us dollars  while its labor costs are denominated in icelandic kronur and a portion of its anode costs are denominated in euros 
the company s historical financial information may not be comparable to its results for future periods 
the company historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of its future results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
for example  the company s historical financial data does not reflect the effects of its acquisition of the remaining interest in the hawesville facility prior to april   its acquisition of the nordural facility prior to april   and the equity earnings of the joint venture purchases of the gramercy assets 
the company s high level of indebtedness requires significant cash flow to meet its debt service requirements  which reduces cash available for other purposes  such as the payment of dividends  and limits the company s ability to pursue its growth strategy 
the company is highly leveraged 
it had an aggregate of approximately million of outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money as of december  in addition  nordural can borrow up to an aggregate of million under its new term loan facility 
the level of the company s indebtedness could have important consequences  including limiting cash flow available for capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends  working capital and other general corporate purposes because a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations must be dedicated to servicing its debt  increasing its vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting its flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  competitive and other changes in its business and the industry in which it operates  placing the company at a disadvantage compared to its competitors who may have less debt and greater operating and financing flexibility than it does  and limiting the company s ability to borrow additional funds  which may prevent it from pursuing favorable acquisition opportunities when they arise 
in addition to its indebtedness  the company s has liabilities and other obligations which could reduce cash available for other purposes and limit its ability to pursue its growth strategy 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the company will need a significant amount of cash to service its debt 
while the company s debt service has decreased as a result of the refinancing  it will increase as nordural draws down under its new term loan facility 
in addition  the company will be required to settle in cash up to the principal amount of its convertible notes which are convertible at any time upon conversion  which could increase its debt service obligations 

table of contents the company is also exposed to risks of interest rate increases 
nordural recently entered into a new million senior term loan facility 
nordural s annual debt service requirements will vary  as amounts outstanding under its new term loan facility will bear interest at a variable rate 
the company s ability to pay interest and to repay or refinance its indebtedness  including its senior term notes and convertible notes  and satisfy other commitments  including funding the nordural expansion  will depend upon its future operating performance  which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors that are beyond its control 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the company s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to the company in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its indebtedness  including the notes  or to fund its other liquidity needs 
if the company is unable to meet its debt service obligations or fund its other liquidity needs  the company could attempt to restructure or refinance its indebtedness or seek additional equity capital 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to accomplish those actions on satisfactory terms  or at all 
restrictive covenants in the company s credit facilities and the indenture governing its senior notes limit the company s ability to incur additional debt and pursue its growth strategy 
the company s revolving credit facility and the indenture governing its senior term notes each contain various covenants that restrict the way it conducts its business and limits the company s ability to incur debt  pay dividends and engage in transactions such as acquisitions and investments  which may impair its ability to pursue its growth strategy 
see liquidity and capital resources debt service 
any failure to comply with those covenants may constitute a breach under the revolving credit facility or the indenture governing the notes  which may result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of its outstanding indebtedness and termination of commitments under its revolving credit facility 
if its indebtedness is accelerated  the company may be unable to repay those amounts upon acceleration and the company s secured lenders could foreclose on any collateral securing the company s secured debt 
substantially all of nordural s assets are pledged as security under its new term loan facility  including  but not limited to  all of nordural s property  plant and equipment related to the smelter and the harbor area and all of nordural s current and future inventory  receivables  insurance policies  bank accounts  and rights under specified contracts relating to the operation of the nordural facility  including its tolling  anode supply and power contracts having a term longer than two years 
in addition  the shares of nordural have been pledged to the lenders as collateral 
if nordural is unable to comply with these covenants  the lenders would be able to cancel commitments under nordural s loan facility  cause all or part of the amounts outstanding under the loan facility to be immediately due and payable and foreclose on any collateral securing the loan facility 
the new term loan facility also contains restrictions on nordural s ability to pay dividends  including a requirement that nordural make a repayment of principal in an amount equal to of any dividend paid to shareholders 
see liquidity and capital resources 
based on nordural s needs for cash to finance its expansion and operations  the company does not currently anticipate that nordural will distribute any cash until the expansion is complete 
the company depends upon dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service obligations 
the company is a holding company and conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries 
the company s ability to meet its debt service obligations depends upon its receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries 
nordural s new senior term loan facility places significant limits on nordural s ability to pay dividends 
subject to the restrictions contained in the company s revolving credit facility and the indenture governing its senior notes  future borrowings by the company s subsidiaries could contain restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends by those subsidiaries 
in addition  under applicable law  the company s subsidiaries could be limited in the amounts that they are permitted to pay as dividends on their capital stock 

table of contents despite current levels of indebtedness  the company may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness 
despite its current and anticipated debt levels  the company may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness from time to time  subject to the restrictions contained in its revolving credit facility and the indenture governing its senior term notes 
the company may borrow amounts under its revolving credit facility  and any such borrowings would be secured by all of the company s accounts receivable and inventory 
although the indenture governing the notes contains restrictions on the company s incurrence of debt  these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and  under certain circumstances  the company could incur substantial indebtedness while remaining in compliance with these restrictions

the price of the company s common stock may fluctuate significantly 
the market price of the company s common stock has experienced significant volatility from time to time  and this volatility may continue in the future 
from january   through march   the intra day sales price of our common stock on nasdaq ranged from to per share 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
the market price for the company s common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including actual or anticipated variations in the company s quarterly results of operations  expectations about the future price of aluminum  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  changes in research coverage by securities analysts  the conversion of some or all of the company s outstanding convertible notes  any announcement by the company of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  developments in the aluminum industry and sales of substantial numbers of shares by current holders of the company s common stock in the public market 
in addition  general economic  political and market conditions and other factors unrelated to the company s operating performance may cause the market price of its common stock to be volatile 
provisions in the company s charter documents and state law may make it difficult for others to obtain control of the company  even though some stockholders may consider it to be beneficial 
certain provisions of the company s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws  as well as provisions of the delaware general corporation law may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of the company  including transactions in which the company s stockholders might otherwise have received a substantial premium for their shares over then current market prices 
for example  these provisions give authority to the company s board of directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of those shares without any stockholder vote  provide  under the company s charter documents  for a board of directors consisting of three classes  each of which serves for a different three year term  require stockholders to give advance notice prior to submitting proposals for consideration at stockholders meetings or to nominate persons for election as directors  and restrict  under the company s charter documents  certain business combinations between us and any person who beneficially owns or more of its outstanding voting stock 
in addition  certain officers of the company have entered into employment and severance compensation agreements that provide for cash payments  immediate vesting of stock options and performance shares and acceleration of other benefits under certain circumstances  including a change in control of the company 
the company s stock incentive plan also provides for acceleration of the ability to exercise stock options and the vesting of performance shares upon a change of control  and the company s non employee directors stock option plan provides for acceleration of an option holder s ability to exercise stock options upon a change of control

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this filing 
overview the company produces primary aluminum 
the aluminum industry is cyclical and the price of primary aluminum which trades as a commodity is determined by global supply and demand 
the key determinants of the company s results of operations and cash flow from operations are as follows the company s selling price is based on the lme price of primary aluminum and fixed price sales contracts 
the company s plants operate at or near capacity  and fluctuations in volume  other than through acquisitions  generally are small 
the principal components of cost of goods sold are alumina  power and labor  which were in excess of of the cost of goods sold 
many of these costs are covered by long term contracts as described below 
average realized price and cost of goods sold per pound shipped are key performance indicators 
revenue varies significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in the lme price of aluminum 
any adverse changes in the conditions that affect the market price of primary aluminum could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
revenue is also impacted by the company s hedging activities 
working capital is relatively stable 
fluctuations in working capital are influenced by the lme price of primary aluminum and by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements from major customers and suppliers 
cost of goods sold  excluding alumina  is expected to remain relatively stable because the company s plants operate near capacity and its major cost drivers are covered by long term contracts 
fluctuations in the cost of alumina are expected as the pricing in these contracts  except for the gramercy alumina contract  is variable and based on lme prices 
power contracts for us facilities provide for primarily fixed priced power through  subject to adjustments for fuel costs for mt

see liquidity and capital resources debt service nordural s new term loan facility the gramercy acquisition on october   the company and noranda finance inc  through joint venture companies  acquired an alumina refinery in gramercy  louisiana and related bauxite mining assets in jamaica collectively  the gramercy assets from kaiser aluminum chemical company the gramercy acquisition 
the purchase price for the gramercy assets was approximately million  subject to working capital adjustments 
the company and noranda each paid one half  or million of the unadjusted purchase price 
kaiser sold the gramercy assets as part of its reorganization to emerge from chapter bankruptcy 
gramercy has an annual production capacity of million metric tons of alumina  approximately of which is supplied to the hawesville facility and to a primary aluminum production facility separately owned by noranda 
the hawesville facility purchases virtually all of its alumina requirements from gramercy 
in october  certain bauxite loading equipment used by the bauxite mining partnership at its st 
ann  jamaica port facility failed  resulting in a temporary interruption of bauxite shipments from the facility 
the st 
ann port facility  which is used to ship bauxite to the gramercy alumina facility and to other customers  operated at a reduced shipping level until full operations resumed in december post acquisition operation of the gramercy assets alumina is the principal raw material used in the production of primary aluminum 
the company acquired its share of the gramercy assets to ensure a stable supply of alumina to the company s primary aluminum production facilities at acceptable costs and to avoid the risk of significant cost increases if the company was required to replace this source of supply in the current high priced and volatile spot alumina market 
prior to the acquisition  the gramercy assets were operated by kaiser as a non autonomous part of kaiser s business 
the dominant portion of the revenues from these operations was derived from alumina sales to century and to noranda 
following the acquisition  the company uses its share of the gramercy assets as a source of alumina for its hawesville facility 
third party cga and bauxite sales are incidental and  standing alone  are not significant and will be maintained only to optimize fixed costs 
further  century and noranda have assumed certain essential management and business functions previously provided by kaiser 
accordingly  there is a lack of continuity between pre and post acquisition revenue producing activity and the manner in which essential management and business functions are handled 
in addition  kaiser did not maintain separate financial statements for the operations that comprise the gramercy assets 
based on the foregoing  the company believes that disclosure of historical financial information relating to the gramercy assets would not be material to an understanding of the company s future operations 
the refinancing on august   the company announced the company s repurchase of approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the company s senior secured first mortgage notes due that were validly tendered pursuant to a tender offer and consent solicitation commenced on july  under the terms of the tender offer  the company paid  for each  principal amount of first mortgage notes purchased in the tender offer  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
holders who tendered their notes prior to pm  new york city time  on august   received an additional payment of per  of principal amount of first mortgage notes tendered 
the primary purpose of the tender offer and consent solicitation was to refinance million of the company s outstanding first mortgage notes with debt bearing a lower interest rate  thereby reducing the company s annual interest expense 
approximately million in aggregate principal amount of first mortgage notes remain outstanding following the tender offer and are scheduled to mature on april  
table of contents in connection with the tender offer and consent solicitation  the company received consents needed to amend the indenture governing the remaining first mortgage notes to eliminate substantially all restrictive covenants and certain default provisions 
the company has provided the trustee under the indenture notice of its intent to call for redemption all outstanding first mortgage notes on or about april  the company financed the tender offer and consent solicitation with a portion of the net proceeds from i the private placement of million aggregate principal amount of the company s convertible senior notes due august   and ii the private placement of million aggregate principal amount of the company s senior notes due august  the company used the remaining proceeds from the sale of the company s convertible notes and senior notes for general corporate purposes 
the nordural acquisition and expansion on april   the company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity shares of nordural hf 
now known as nordural ehf 
from columbia ventures corporation 
nordural is an icelandic company that owns and operates the nordural facility  a primary aluminum reduction facility located in grundartangi  iceland 
built in  the nordural facility is the company s most recently constructed and lowest cost facility 
it currently has an annual production capacity of approximately million pounds 
since the acquisition  the company has commenced work on an expansion of the nordural facility to increase its annual production capacity to approximately million pounds  or more than double its current annual production capacity 
as currently planned  the expansion will add up to million pounds to the nordural facility s annual production capacity 
the expansion is projected to be completed by late and is expected to cost approximately million 
in connection with the expansion  the company agreed on the terms of amendments to several long term contracts with the government of iceland  local municipalities and the grundartangi harbour fund  which were effective upon the closing of nordural s new term loan facility 
the company agreed to an lme based ten year alumina tolling contract with glencore for million pounds of the expansion capacity 
the power needed for the expansion capacity will be purchased under a long term lme based agreement with sudurnes energy and reykjavik energy 
the company s new energy agreement includes power for approximately million pounds of additional capacity  upon satisfaction of certain conditions  including the completion of a power transmission agreement 
with the additional million pounds of capacity  the total annual production capacity of the nordural facility would increase to million pounds by late a decision on the additional million pounds of capacity is expected in early following completion of the expansion  nordural will have all the infrastructure and support facilities necessary for further expansion to million pounds of annual production capacity 
this expansion would be made at relatively low capital cost 
the company is in discussions for the supply of electric power to support this further expansion

new contracts are expected to be settled in application of critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the financial statements requires that management make subjective estimates  assumptions and judgments in applying these accounting policies 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience about past and current events and on assumptions about future events 
critical accounting estimates require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and a change in these estimates may have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial position or results of operations 
significant judgments and estimates made by the company include expenses and liabilities related to pensions and other postemployment benefits and forward delivery contracts and financial instruments 
pension and other postemployment benefit liabilities the company sponsors various pension plans and also participates in a union sponsored multi employer pension plan for the collective bargaining unit employees at the hawesville facility 
the liabilities and annual income or expense of the company s pension and other postemployment benefit plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate and the long term rate of asset return 
in developing its expected long term rate of return assumption for pension fund assets  the company evaluated input from its actuaries  including their review of asset class return expectations as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns are based on historical returns of broad equity and bond indices 
the company also considered its historical year compound returns 
century anticipates that the company s investments will generate long term rates of return of 
the company s expected long term rate of return is based on an assumed asset allocation of equity funds and fixed income funds 
the discount rate that the company utilizes for determining future pension and post employment obligations is based on a review of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a 
table of contents recognized rating agency 
the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased to at december  from and at december  and  respectively 
lowering the expected long term rate of return by from to would have increased the company s pension expense for the year ended december  by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate assumptions by would have increased the company s pension expense for the year ended december  by approximately million 
the company provides postemployment benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all retired employees 
sfas no 
requires the company to accrue the estimated cost of providing postretirement benefits during the working careers of those employees who could become eligible for such benefits when they retire 
the company funds these benefits as the retirees submit claims 
measurement of the company s postretirement benefit obligations requires the use of several assumptions about factors that will affect the amount and timing of future benefit payments 
the assumed health care cost trend rates are the most critical assumptions for measurement of the postretirement benefits obligation 
changes in the health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care benefit obligations 
the company assumes medical inflation is initially  declining to over six years and thereafter 
a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects in one one percentage percentage point increase point decrease in thousands effect on total of service and interest cost components effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation forward delivery contracts and financial instruments the company routinely enters into market priced physical and fixed priced financial contracts for the sale of primary aluminum and the purchase of raw materials in future periods 
the company applies the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  in accounting for these types of contracts 
for those physical delivery contracts which management believes are probable of future delivery  such contracts are classified as normal purchases and normal sales and are not accounted for as derivatives 
the aluminum based financial and physical delivery contracts that are derivatives  as provided for in current accounting standards  are marked to market using the lme spot and forward market for primary aluminum 
because there is no quoted futures market price for the us midwest premium component of the market price for primary aluminum  it is necessary for management to estimate the us midwest premium 
fluctuations in the lme price of primary aluminum have a significant impact on gains and losses included in the company s financial statements from period to period 
unrealized gains and losses are either included in other comprehensive income loss or net gain loss on forward contracts  depending on criteria as provided for in the accounting standards 
the forward natural gas purchase contracts are marked to market using the nymex spot and forward market for natural gas 
fluctuations in the nymex price of natural gas can have a significant impact on gains and losses included in the company s financial statements from period to period 
the company has designated these forward contracts as cash flow hedges for forecasted natural gas transactions in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
as amended 
the company assesses the effectiveness of these cash flow hedges quarterly 
the effective portion of the gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately
