item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the st 
joe company is one of florida s largest real estate operating companies 
we believe we have one of the largest inventories of private land suitable for development in the state of florida  with a very low cost basis 
the majority of our land is located in northwest florida 
in order to optimize the value of our core real estate assets in northwest florida  our strategic plan calls for us to reposition our substantial timberland holdings for higher and better uses 
we increase the value of our raw land assets  most of which are currently managed as timberland  through the development and subsequent sale of parcels  home sites  and homes  or through the direct sale of unimproved land 
in addition  we reinvest qualifying asset sales proceeds into like kind properties under our tax deferral strategy which has enabled us to create a significant portfolio of commercial rental properties 
we also provide commercial real estate services  including brokerage  property management  and construction management for company owned assets as well as for third parties 
we have four operating segments towns resorts development  commercial real estate development and services  land sales  and forestry 
our towns resorts development segment generates revenues from the sale of housing units built by us  the sale of developed home sites  rental income  club operations  investments in limited partnerships and joint ventures  brokerage  title issuance and mortgage origination fees on certain transactions within our towns resorts developments  and management fees 

table of contents our commercial real estate development and services segment generates revenues from the rental and or sale of commercial buildings owned and or developed by us  the sale of developed and undeveloped land for commercial  retail  apartment  and industrial properties  realty revenues  consisting of property and asset management fees  construction revenues and lease and sales brokerage commissions  and investments in limited partnerships and joint ventures 
our land sales segment generates revenues from the sale of parcels of undeveloped land  and the sale of developed home sites primarily within rural settings 
our forestry segment generates revenues from the sale of pulpwood and timber  the sale of cypress lumber and mulch  and the sale of bulk land 
our ability to generate revenues  cash flows and profitability is directly related to the real estate market  primarily in florida  and the economy in general 
considerable economic and political uncertainties exist that could have adverse effects on consumer buying behavior  construction costs  availability of labor and materials and other factors affecting us and the real estate industry in general 
additionally  increases in interest rates could reduce the demand for homes we build and home sites we develop  particularly primary housing and home sites  and commercial properties we develop or sell 
however  we believe our secondary resort housing markets are less sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we have the ability to mitigate these risks by building to contract as well as building in phases 
management periodically conducts market research in the early stages of a project s development to ensure our product meets expected customer demand 
we also continuously and actively monitor competitors product offerings to evaluate the competitive position of our products 
we are disciplined about the release of new product in northwest florida 
our goal is to ensure that as much of our land as possible benefits from the appreciation that we are building with the region s increased visibility  infrastructure development and place making 
our commercial real estate development and services segment continues to build on strong market interest in northwest florida s retail  office  multi family and other mixed use products caused by historical constraints on supply in the area as well as high interest by developers 
real estate market conditions in our regions of development  particularly for residential and resort property in northwest florida  have been exceptionally strong 
these current market conditions place us in an unusually favorable position which may not continue in the future 
however  we believe that long term prospects of job growth  coupled with strong in migration population expansion in florida  indicate that demand levels may remain favorable over at least the near term horizon 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements  including statements about our beliefs  plans  objectives  goals  expectations  estimates and intentions  as well as trends and uncertainties that could affect our results 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
for additional information concerning these factors and related matters  see risk factors and forward looking statements in item of this report 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
additionally  we evaluate the results of these estimates on an on going basis 
management s estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investment in real estate and cost of real estate sales 
costs associated with a specific real estate project are capitalized once we determine that the project is economically viable 
we capitalize costs directly associated with development and construction of identified real estate projects 
indirect costs that clearly relate to a specific project under development  such as internal costs of a regional project field office  are also capitalized 
we capitalize interest based on the amount of underlying expenditures up to total interest expense  and real estate taxes on real estate projects under development 
if we determine not to complete a project  any previously capitalized costs are expensed 
real estate inventory costs include land and common development costs  such as roads  sewers  and amenities  home construction costs  property taxes  capitalized interest  and certain indirect costs 
a portion of real estate inventory and estimates for costs to complete are allocated to each unit based on the relative sales value of each unit as compared to the estimated sales value of the total project 
these estimates are reevaluated at least annually  with any adjustments being allocated prospectively to the remaining units available for sale 
the accounting estimate related to inventory valuation is susceptible to change due to the use of assumptions about future sales proceeds and related real estate expenditures 
management s assumptions about future housing and home site sales prices  sales volume and sales velocity require significant judgment because the real estate market is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
in addition  actual results could differ from management s estimates due to changes in anticipated development  construction and overhead costs 
although we have not made significant adjustments affecting real estate gross profit margins in the past  there can be no assurances that estimates used to generate future real estate gross profit margins will not differ from our current estimates 
revenue recognition percentage of completion 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  revenue for multi family residences under construction is recognized using the percentage of completion method when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a refund except for nondelivery of the unit  sufficient units have already been sold to assure that the entire property will not revert to rental property  sales price is assured  and aggregate sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated 
revenue is recognized in proportion to the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to estimated total costs 
revenue for our multi family residences which were under construction at watersound beach in was recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
since the project was substantially completed as of december   we recorded substantially all of the activity related to this property during the year ended december  during the period ended march   we incurred million in construction cost adjustments for this project 
had these costs been quantified in  they would have been included in our budgets and thus have had an impact on our results for the year ended december  if these costs had been included in the total project budget  gross profit would have been reduced by million pre tax  million after tax  since a lower 
table of contents percentage of revenue would also have been recognized 
the results for the year ended december  would have been increased by million pre tax  million after tax 
management has evaluated the impact of this item  which represented of net income per diluted share for both years ended december  and  and concluded that it is not significant to our or results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
our long lived assets  primarily real estate held for investment  are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted 
this review involves a number of assumptions and estimates used in determining whether impairment exists  including estimation of undiscounted cash flows 
depending on the asset  we use varying methods to determine fair value  such as i discounting of expected future cash flows  ii determining resale values by market  or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
these methods of determining fair value can fluctuate up or down significantly as a result of a number of factors  including changes in the general economy of our markets and demand for real estate 
if we determine that impairment exists due to the inability to recover an asset s carrying value  a provision for loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value 
goodwill is carried at the lower of cost or fair value and is tested for impairment at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted  by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of each reporting unit with goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit taken as a whole 
the impairment review involves a number of assumptions and estimates including estimating discounted future cash flows  net operating income  future economic conditions  fair value of assets held  and discount rates 
if this comparison indicates that the goodwill of a particular reporting unit is impaired  the aggregate of the fair value of each of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are compared to the fair value of the reporting unit to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
intangible assets 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values  using customary estimates of fair value  including data from appraisals  comparable sales  discounted cash flow analysis  and other methods 
these fair values can fluctuate up or down significantly as a result of a number of factors and estimates  including changes in the general economy of our markets  demand for real estate  amortization periods  and fair market values assigned to leases as well as fair value assigned to customer relationships 
pension plan 
the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan covering a majority of our employees 
currently  our pension plan is over funded and contributes income to the company 
the accounting for pension benefits is determined by standardized accounting and actuarial methods using numerous estimates  including discount rates  expected long term investment returns on plan assets  employee turnover  mortality and retirement ages  and future salary increases 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the income contributed by the pension plan 
we engage the services of an independent actuary and investment consultant to assist us in determining these assumptions and in the calculation of pension income 
for example  in  a increase in the assumed long term rate of return on pension assets would have resulted in a million increase in pre tax income million net of tax 
a decrease in the assumed long term rate of return would have caused an equivalent decrease in pre tax income 
a increase in the assumed discount rate on pension obligations would have resulted in a million decrease in pre tax income million net of tax 
a decrease in the assumed discount rate would have resulted in a million increase in pre tax income million net of tax 
income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate our income taxes 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of federal and state tax laws 
we estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets 
table of contents and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  and changes in tax laws 
to the extent adjustments are required in any given period we would include the adjustments in the tax provision in the statement of operations and or balance sheet 
these adjustments could materially impact our financial position and results of operation 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r fas r  share based payment  a revision of fas fas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions  eliminating the alternative previously allowed by fas to use the intrinsic value method of accounting 
the grant date fair value will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of the instruments using methods similar to those required by fas and currently used by the company to calculate pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures 
the cost will be recognized ratably over the period during which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
for public entities like the company that do not file as small business issuers  fas r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual period that begins after june  the company plans to adopt fas r as of july  as a result of adopting fas r  the company will recognize as compensation cost in its financial statements the unvested portion of existing options granted prior to the effective date and the cost of stock options granted to employees after the effective date based on the fair value of the stock options at grant date 
also in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for real estate time sharing transactions fas 
fas clarifies the accounting for sales and other transactions involving real estate time sharing transactions and is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  upon adoption  the company does not expect fas to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
also in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets fas 
fas eliminates a previous exception from fair value reporting for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and introduces an exception from fair value reporting for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange is considered to have commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
fas is applicable to nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june   with earlier application permitted 
upon adoption  the company does not expect fas to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations

management believes that our financial condition is strong and that our cash  real estate and other assets  operating cash flows  and borrowing capacity  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses  including the continued investment in real estate developments

approximately one half of these expenditures are for home construction that generally takes place after the signing of a binding contract with a buyer to purchase the home following construction 
as a consequence  if contract activity slows  home construction will also slow 
we expect this general expenditure level and relationship between expenditures and housing contracts to continue in the future 
we have generated a net operating loss for tax purposes in each of the three prior tax years  thereby negating the cash payment of federal income taxes during while we do not believe that federal taxable income will exceed our net operating loss and other carryforwards for  it is possible that we may be required to make a cash payment for federal income taxes for that year
