net revenue 
we sell our products to leading manufacturers of broadband communications equipment in each of our target markets 
because we leverage our technologies across different markets  certain of our integrated circuits may be incorporated into equipment used in several different markets 
we utilize independent foundries to manufacture all of our semiconductor products 
our net revenue is generated principally by sales of our semiconductor products 
such sales represented approximately  and of our total net revenue in  and  respectively 
we derive the remaining balance of our net revenue predominantly from development agreements  software licenses and maintenance agreements  system level reference designs and cancellation fees 
the majority of our sales occur through the efforts of our direct sales force 
however  we derived approximately  and of our total net revenue from sales made through distributors in  and  respectively 
the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  and the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products 
for these and other reasons  our net revenue and results of operations in and prior periods may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations 
from time to time  our key customers place large orders causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly 
we expect these fluctuations will continue 

table of contents sales to our significant customers  including sales to their manufacturing subcontractors  as a percentage of net revenue were as follows years ended december  hewlett packard motorola dell cisco five largest customers as a group less than of net revenue 
includes sales to compaq  which was acquired by hewlett packard in may  for all periods presented 
includes sales to linksys  which was acquired by cisco in june  for all periods presented 
we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in and for the foreseeable future 
the identity of our largest customers and their respective contributions to our net revenue have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period 
net revenue derived from all independent customers located outside the united states  excluding foreign subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors of customers that are headquartered in the united states  as a percent of total net revenue was as follows years ended december  asia europe other net revenue derived from actual shipments to international destinations  primarily to asia  represented approximately  and of the company s net revenue in  and  respectively 
all of our revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
gross margin 
our gross profit as a percentage of net revenue  or gross margin  has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following our product mix and volumes of product sales  stock based compensation expense  the position of our products in their respective life cycles  the effects of competition  the effects of competitive pricing programs  manufacturing cost efficiencies and inefficiencies  fluctuations in direct product costs such as wafer pricing and assembly  packaging and testing costs  and overhead costs such as prototyping expenses  provisions for excess or obsolete inventories  product warranty costs  amortization of purchased intangible assets  and licensing and royalty arrangements 

table of contents net income loss 
our net income loss has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following stock based compensation expense  amortization of purchased intangible assets  settlement costs  in process research and development  or ipr d  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  stock option exchange expense  and restructuring costs 
in our net income was approximately million as compared to a net loss of approximately million in  a difference of billion 
this significant improvement in profitability in was the direct result of a improvement in net revenue and a percentage point improvement in gross margin 
this resulted in an increase of million of gross profit 
in addition  we had significant reductions in in stock based compensation expense  settlement costs  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  and stock option exchange expense  aggregating approximately million  offset by an increase in ipr d of approximately million 
product cycles 
the cycle for test  evaluation and adoption of our products by customers can range from three to more than six months  with an additional three to more than nine months before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we incur expenses for research and development  selling  general and administrative efforts  and investments in inventory  to the time we generate corresponding revenue  if any 
the rate of new orders may vary significantly from month to month and quarter to quarter 
if anticipated sales or shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our results of operations for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  would be materially and adversely affected 
acquisition strategy 
an element of our business strategy involves the acquisition of businesses  assets  products or technologies that allow us to reduce the time required to develop new technologies and products and bring them to market  incorporate enhanced functionality into and complement our existing product offerings  augment our engineering workforce  and or enhance our technological capabilities 
we plan to continue to evaluate strategic opportunities as they arise  including business combination transactions  strategic relationships  capital infusions and the purchase or sale of assets 
in  and we completed eight acquisitions for original aggregate equity consideration of million and cash consideration of million 
in we acquired raidcore  inc  a developer of redundant array of inexpensive disks  or raid  and virtualization software  sand video  inc  a developer of advanced video compression semiconductor technology  m stream  inc  a developer of solutions for signal to noise ratio performance improvements in cellular handsets  widcomm  inc  a provider of software solutions for bluetooth wireless products  zyray wireless inc  a developer of baseband co processors addressing wcdma wideband code division multiple access mobile devices  and alphamosaic limited  a developer of advanced mobile imaging  multimedia and d graphics technology optimized for use in cellphones and other mobile devices 
in we acquired certain assets of gadzoox networks  inc  a provider of storage networking technology 
in we acquired mobilink telecom  inc  a supplier of chipsets and reference designs for use in mobile phones  pdas and cellular modem cards 
because each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase transaction  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies commencing as of their respective acquisition dates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
business enterprise segments 
we operate in one reportable operating segment  broadband communications 
the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  or sfas  establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual consolidated financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in 
table of contents interim financial reports 
sfas also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
although we had four operating segments at december   under the aggregation criteria set forth in sfas we only operate in one reportable operating segment  broadband communications 
under sfas  two or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes if aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic principles of sfas  if the segments have similar economic characteristics  and if the segments are similar in each of the following areas the nature of products and services  the nature of the production processes  the type or class of customer for their products and services  and the methods used to distribute their products or provide their services 
we meet each of the aggregation criteria for the following reasons the sale of integrated circuits is the only material source of revenue for each of our four operating segments or business groups  the integrated circuits sold by each of our operating segments use the same standard cmos manufacturing processes  the integrated circuits marketed by each of our operating segments are sold to one type of customer manufacturers of broadband equipment  who incorporate our integrated circuits into their electronic products  and all of our integrated circuits are sold through a centralized sales force and common wholesale distributors 
all of our business groups share similar economic characteristics as they have a similar long term business model  operate at similar gross margins  and have similar research and development expenses and similar selling  general and administrative expenses 
the causes for variation among each of our business groups are the same and include factors such as i life cycle and price and cost fluctuations  ii number of competitors  iii product differentiation and iv size of market opportunity 
additionally  each business group is subject to the overall cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
the number and composition of employees and the amount and types of tools and materials required are similar for each business group 
finally  even though we periodically reorganize our business groups based upon changes in customers  end markets or products  acquisitions  long term growth strategies  and the experience and bandwidth of our vice presidents general managers  the common financial goals for each business group remain constant 
because we meet each of the criteria set forth in sfas and our four business groups as of december  share similar economic characteristics  we aggregate our results of operations in one reportable operating segment 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  warranty reserves  inventory reserves  goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations  strategic investments  deferred income tax asset valuation allowances  restructuring costs  litigation and other loss contingencies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from management s estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements net revenue we recognize product revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii our price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
in addition  we do not recognize revenue until all customer acceptance requirements have been met  when applicable 
these criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment 
however  a portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return 
product revenue on sales made through these distributors is not recognized until the distributors ship the product to their customers 
customer purchase orders and or contracts are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and the completion of any customer acceptance requirements  when applicable  are used to verify product delivery or that services have been rendered 
we assess whether a price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess the collectibility of our accounts receivable based primarily upon the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments  such as competitive pricing programs and rebates  in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data  specific criteria included in rebate agreements  and other factors known at the time 
additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of any of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
inventory and warranty reserves 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs could be required 
our products typically carry a one to three year warranty 
we establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  use of materials and service delivery costs incurred in correcting any product failure 
should actual product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required  which could reduce gross margins 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization  and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii another significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the semiconductor industry or iv any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
we evaluate these assets  including purchased intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our intangible assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have 
table of contents used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
deferred taxes and contingencies 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
as a result of our cumulative losses and the full utilization of our loss carrybacks  we concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets was appropriate 
in the future  if we realize a deferred tax asset that carries a valuation allowance  we will record a reduction to income tax expense in the period of such realization 
we record estimated tax liabilities to the extent the contingencies are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
however the actual liability in any such tax contingencies may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
litigation and settlement costs 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes  litigation and other legal actions 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters  including our pending securities class action lawsuit 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
in addition the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments  which could adversely impact gross margins in future periods 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional costs

table of contents net revenue 
our revenue is generated principally by sales of our semiconductor products 
net revenue is revenue less reductions for rebates and provisions for returns and allowances 
the following table presents net revenue from each of our major target markets and their contributions to the increase in net revenue in as compared to years ended december  of net of net amount revenue amount revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages enterprise networking broadband communications mobile and wireless net revenue the growth in net revenue resulted primarily from an increase in the volume of shipments of our semiconductor products stemming from the rise in demand for our products in each of our major target markets in  except for intel processor based server chipsets  included in enterprise networking  which declined 
the previously anticipated decline in shipments of our intel processor based server chipsets resulted in a million decrease in net revenue for those products in as compared with our enterprise networking products include ethernet controllers  transceivers  switches  broadband network and security processors  server chipsets and storage products 
our broadband communications products include solutions for cable modems  digital cable set top boxes  direct broadcast satellites  personal video recording applications  dsl applications  ip set top boxes  hd dvd and digital tv 
our mobile and wireless products include wireless lan  cellular  bluetooth  mobile multimedia and voip solutions 
the following table presents net revenue from each of our major target markets and their contributions to the decrease in net revenue that occurred in the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended september  three months ended three months ended december  september  of net of net amount revenue amount revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages enterprise networking broadband communications mobile and wireless net revenue the decrease in net revenue from the third quarter of to the fourth quarter of resulted primarily from overall industry weakness  specifically related to inventory corrections in the direct broadcast satellite and networking markets 
in addition  as expected  we experienced a quarter to quarter decline in shipments of our intel processor based server chipsets of approximately million 
we currently anticipate that total net revenue in the first quarter of will be relatively consistent with the million achieved in the fourth quarter of in the first quarter of  we expect continued softness in the enterprise networking market and a further decline in shipments of our intel processor based server chipsets 
in addition we expect to see some seasonality in our mobile and wireless business  offset by an increase in our bluetooth business 
we also believe we are seeing signs of recovery in our direct broadcast satellite business  as well as in other areas of our broadband communications target market 
we recorded rebates to certain customers in the amounts of million and million in and  respectively 
we account for rebates in accordance with fasb emerging issues task force issue  or eitf  
table of contents issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  and  accordingly  record reductions to revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based upon the terms included in our rebate agreements 
historically  reversals of rebate accruals have not been material 
we anticipate that accrued rebates in absolute dollars will vary in future periods based on the level of overall sales to customers who participate in our rebate programs 
however  we do not expect rebates to impact our gross margin as our prices to these customers and corresponding revenue and margins are already net of such rebates 
cost of revenue and gross profit 
cost of revenue includes the cost of purchasing the finished silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries  costs associated with assembly  packaging  test and quality assurance for semiconductor products  prototyping costs  amortization of purchased technology  and manufacturing overhead  including costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support  product warranty costs and provisions for excess or obsolete inventories 
gross profit represents net revenue less the cost of revenue 
the increase in absolute dollars of gross profit resulted primarily from the increase in net revenue 
gross margin increased from in to in the primary factors that resulted in this percentage point improvement in gross margin were i a percentage point improvement in product margin primarily due to changes in product mix  ii decreases in stock option exchange expense  the amortization of purchased intangible assets and stock based compensation expense  which improved gross margin by  and percentage points  respectively  iii offset by an increase in the provision for excess and obsolete inventory of percentage points 
in we increased our provision for excess and obsolete inventory as compared to as a result of an increase in gross inventory 
the primary factors that resulted in increased inventory were the expansion of inventory in response to higher levels of purchase orders received from our customers  shorter lead times for certain of our customers  and the buildup of buffer inventory based upon our forecast of future demand for certain key products 
our inventory levels are determined based on these factors as well as the stage at which our products are in their respective product life cycles and competitive situations in the marketplace 
such considerations are balanced against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels and may require us to make additional provisions 
the following table presents details of certain non cash expenses incurred in manufacturing operations for and that are included in cost of revenue years ended december  of net of net amount revenue amount revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages stock based compensation expense amortization of purchased intangible assets stock option exchange expense the decrease in stock based compensation expense related primarily to a reduction in the number of assumed unvested options and shares of restricted stock being amortized and the elimination of deferred compensation as a result of the termination of employment of certain employees 
at december  the unamortized balance of deferred compensation  which will be amortized to cost of revenue through  was approximately million 
however  if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested stock options or restricted stock  we may be required to either accelerate from future periods or cancel the remaining deferred compensation 
in the event additional deferred compensation is recorded in connection with any future acquisitions  our cost of revenue may be increased by its amortization 
the decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets resulted from fewer purchased intangible assets being amortized 
at december  the unamortized balance of completed technology was 
table of contents approximately million  of which million and million are expected to be amortized to cost of revenue in and  respectively 
however  if we acquire purchased intangible assets in the future  our cost of revenue may be increased by the amortization of those assets 
we charged approximately million in stock option exchange expense to cost of revenue in there were no comparable charges incurred in gross margin has been and will likely continue to be impacted in the future by competitive pricing programs  fluctuations in the volume of our product sales  fluctuations in silicon wafer costs and assembly  packaging and testing costs  product warranty costs  provisions for excess or obsolete inventories  possible future changes in product mix and the introduction of products with lower margins  among other factors 
our gross margin may also be impacted by additional stock based compensation expense and amortization of purchased intangible assets related to future acquisitions and will be negatively impacted by the effectiveness of the fasb s revised rules on stock option expensing in the third quarter of for a discussion of the effects of future expensing of stock options  see recent accounting pronouncements  below 
we anticipate that gross margin in the first quarter of will be relatively consistent with the reported in the fourth quarter of research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses the following table presents research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses for and years ended december  of net of net amount revenue amount revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages research and development selling  general and administrative research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design and development activities  costs related to engineering design tools and computer hardware  subcontracting costs  prototyping costs and facilities expenses 
research and development expense does not include amounts associated with stock based compensation or stock option exchange expenses for employees engaged in research and development or expense amounts associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets related to research and development activities 
the increase in research and development expense in absolute dollars resulted primarily from a million increase in personnel related expenses 
the increase in personnel related expenses was primarily due to a increase in the number of employees engaged in research and development activities in  through acquisitions and hiring 
in addition  there were increases in outsourced engineering  facilities and engineering design tool expenses in  offset in part by lower depreciation expense on computer software and equipment 
based upon past experience  we anticipate that research and development expense in absolute dollars will increase over the long term as a result of the growth and diversification of the markets we serve  new product opportunities  changes in our compensation policies and any expansion into new markets and technologies 
we anticipate that research and development expense in the first quarter of will increase from the million incurred in the fourth quarter of we remain committed to significant research and development efforts to extend our technology leadership in the broadband communications markets in which we operate 
we hold over us patents  and we maintain an active program of filing for and acquiring additional us and foreign patents in broadband communications and other fields 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  legal and other professional fees  facilities expenses  communications expenses and advertising expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense does not include amounts associated with stock 
table of contents based compensation or stock option exchange expenses for administrative employees or expense amounts associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets related to selling  general and administrative activities 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in absolute dollars resulted primarily from a million increase in personnel related expenses 
the increase in personnel related expenses was primarily due to a increase in the number of employees engaged in selling  general and administrative activities in  through acquisitions and hiring 
in addition  there were increases in expenses for travel and entertainment  marketing and accounting  which were offset by decreases in legal expense 
based upon past experience  we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expense in absolute dollars will continue to increase over the long term to support any expansion of our operations through indigenous growth and acquisitions  as a result of periodic changes in our infrastructure to support any increased headcount  changes in our compensation policies  acquisition and integration activities  and international operations  and as a result of current and future litigation 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expense in the first quarter of will increase from the million incurred in the fourth quarter of stock based compensation expense the following table presents stock based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development and selling  general and administrative activities for and  which expense was segregated from the presentation of those items in the consolidated statements of operations years ended december  of net of net amount revenue amount revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages research and development selling  general and administrative stock based compensation expense generally represents the amortization of deferred compensation resulting from acquisitions 
deferred compensation primarily represents the difference between the fair value of our class a common stock at the measurement date of each acquisition and the exercise price of each unvested stock option or each share of restricted stock assumed in the acquisition 
to a much lesser extent  stock based compensation expense represents expense related to restricted stock units issued to employees 
deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of shareholders equity and is amortized ratably over the respective vesting periods of the applicable unvested securities  generally three to five years 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense related primarily to a reduction in the number of assumed unvested options and shares of restricted stock being amortized and the elimination of deferred compensation as a result of the termination of employment of certain employees 
at december  the unamortized balance of deferred compensation  which will be amortized to operating expenses through  was approximately million 
however  if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested stock options or restricted stock  we may be required to either accelerate from future periods or cancel the remaining deferred compensation 
in the event additional deferred compensation is recorded in connection with any future acquisitions  our operating expenses would be increased by its amortization 
for a discussion of the effects of future expensing of stock options  see the recent accounting pronouncements  below 

table of contents amortization of purchased intangible assets the following table presents amortization of purchased intangible assets related to research and development and selling  general and administrative activities for and  which expense was segregated from the presentation of those items in the consolidated statements of operations years ended december  of net of net increase amount revenue amount revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages research and development selling  general and administrative purchased intangible assets primarily include completed technology  customer relationships  customer contracts and backlog  and are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the respective assets  ranging from less than one to three years 
at december  the unamortized balance of customer relationships and other purchased intangible assets that will be amortized to future operating expense was approximately million  of which million and million are expected to be amortized in and  respectively 
however  if we acquire purchased intangible assets in the future  our operating expenses would be increased by the amortization of those assets 
settlement costs the following table presents settlement costs for and years ended december  of net of net amount revenue amount revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages settlement costs we recorded million in settlement costs in of this amount  million was related to the settlement of various litigation matters  and the remaining million reflects settlement costs related to a claim arising from an acquisition and certain indemnification costs 
for a more detailed discussion of our settled and outstanding litigation  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in may we completed a management transition at our serverworks corporation subsidiary and entered into a settlement agreement resolving various issues and disputes raised by certain employees and former securities holders of serverworks  including issues and disputes with three departing employees  relating to agreements entered into when we acquired serverworks in january in connection with the settlement  we incurred approximately million in cash payments and expenses and recorded a one time non cash charge of approximately million in may  reflecting the acceleration from future periods of stock based compensation expense  most of which was previously recorded as deferred compensation established upon the acquisition of serverworks and based upon stock market valuations at the time of the acquisition 
in august we agreed with intel corporation to settle all litigation between the companies as well as litigation involving our respective affiliates 
in connection with the settlement agreement  we paid intel million in we recorded an additional million in settlement costs in in connection with the settlement of other litigation and third party claims 

table of contents in process research and development ipr d totaled million for acquisitions completed in no comparable amount of ipr d was recorded in the amounts allocated to ipr d were determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as clarified by fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 amounts assigned to ipr d meeting the above stated criteria were charged to expense as part of the allocation of purchase price 
the fair value of the ipr d for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  the expected future cash flows from each project under development are estimated and discounted to their net present value at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets  as well as the risks inherent in the development process  including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance 
each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations  the existence and reliance on core technology  the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the complexity  cost and time to complete the remaining development 
future cash flows for each project were estimated based on forecasted revenue and costs  taking into account product life cycles  and market penetration and growth rates 
the ipr d charges include only the fair value of ipr d performed as of the respective acquisition dates 
the fair value of developed technology is included in identifiable purchased intangible assets  and future research and development is included in goodwill 
we believe the amounts recorded as ipr d  as well as developed technology  represent the fair values and approximate the amounts an independent party would pay for these projects at the time of the respective acquisition dates 
the following table summarizes the significant assumptions at the acquisition dates underlying the valuations of ipr d for our acquisitions completed in weighted average average risk estimated estimated estimated adjusted percent time to cost to discount company acquired development projects complete complete complete rate ipr d in years in millions in millions raidcore raid software stack sand video decoder codec chips m stream algorithm implemented in dsp chip zyray wcdma baseband co processor alphamosaic multimedia co processor we completed the development projects related to the raidcore acquisition 
for one development project related to the sand video acquisition  we reallocated the resources to focus on semiconductor products that we believe are a higher priority 
all other development projects are still in process 
except as noted above  actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the acquisitions 
the assumptions consist primarily of expected completion dates for the ipr d projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projections for the products once they have entered the market 
as of the respective acquisition dates of the acquisitions  certain ongoing development projects were in process 
research and development costs to bring the products of the acquired companies to technological feasibility are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets the following table presents impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for and years ended december  of net of net amount revenue amount revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we performed annual impairment assessments of the carrying value of goodwill recorded in connection with various acquisitions as required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  in october and upon completion of the october and annual impairment assessments  we determined no impairment was indicated as the estimated fair values of our four reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values 
in accordance with sfas  we compared the carrying value of each of our reporting units that existed at those times to their estimated fair values 
at october  and we determined and identified our four reporting units in accordance with sfas we estimated the fair values of our reporting units primarily using the income approach valuation methodology that includes the discounted cash flow method  taking into consideration the market approach and certain market multiples as verification of the values derived using the discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete four year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes and consistent with those distributed to our board of directors 
cash flows beyond the four year discrete forecasts were estimated using a terminal value calculation  which incorporated historical and forecasted financial trends for each identified reporting unit and considered long term earnings growth rates for publicly traded peer companies 
future cash flows were discounted to present value by incorporating the present value techniques discussed in fasb concepts statement  using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements  or concepts statement specifically  the income approach valuations included reporting unit cash flow discount rates ranging from to  and terminal value growth rates ranging from to 
publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of our company was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of our reporting units estimated using the discounted cash flow methodology 
in may we determined that indicators of impairment existed for two of our reporting units  serverworks and mobile communications  and an additional impairment assessment was performed at that time 
we tested the goodwill of these two reporting units for impairment in accordance with sfas the implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner as that which is utilized to estimate the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
as part of the second step of the impairment test performed in  we calculated the fair value of certain assets  including developed technology and ipr d 
to determine the implied value of goodwill  fair values were allocated to the assets and liabilities of each of the affected reporting units in the implied fair value of goodwill was measured as the excess of the fair value of the affected reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities 
the impairment loss for each of the affected reporting units was measured by the amount the carrying value of goodwill for that reporting unit exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill 
based on this assessment  we recorded a charge of million in june to write down the value of goodwill associated with the reporting units 
of this charge  million represented the balance of goodwill related to the serverworks reporting unit and million represented the balance of goodwill related to the mobile communications reporting unit 
with respect to the serverworks reporting unit  the primary factors that contributed to the impairment assessment were additional competitive pressures in the server market and recent design losses experienced by that reporting unit that were attributable  in part  to our ongoing inability to obtain required design information from a third party that is also a competitor 
another factor that contributed to the impairment assessment was the recording of additional goodwill due to contingent consideration earned by former serverworks stockholders and employees see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the competitive pressures 
table of contents and design losses  we reduced our forecasts of future operating results for the serverworks reporting unit for periods beginning as early as the second quarter of with the expectation of future loss of market share for that business 
these forecasts in turn formed the basis for estimating the fair value of the serverworks reporting unit as of june we are continuing to pursue strategies to reposition our serverworks business and develop alternative sources of revenue for that reporting unit 
with respect to the mobile communications reporting unit  the primary factor that contributed to the impairment assessment was the recording of additional goodwill due to contingent consideration earned by former mobilink shareholders and employees in may see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  after that reporting unit had already been written down to its implied fair value in october in january we acquired approximately patents and patent applications related to the read channel and hard disk controller market  for million 
the immediate purpose for acquiring this patent portfolio was to assist us in the defense and settlement of then ongoing and future intellectual property litigation 
as a result  we were unable to estimate any future cash flows from the patents 
we also did not have any plans to resell the patents to a third party 
due to our intended use for these assets  we concluded that indicators of impairment existed upon acquisition of the patents because the carrying value of the patents might not be recoverable 
upon determining that indicators of impairment existed  we performed a recoverability test in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of long lived assets should include only the future cash flows that are directly associated with  and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
the only cash flows expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the patents are the cash savings expected to result from reduced but undeterminable litigation expenses over the next several years 
due to the unpredictable nature of legal disputes  it is not possible to reasonably i determine if our strategy with respect to the patents will be successful  ii forecast litigation expenses that would have been incurred if the patent portfolio was not acquired  or iii forecast cash flows generated as a result of acquiring the patents 
as a result  no reasonable analysis could be prepared to support future cash flows associated with the patents 
accordingly  pursuant to sfas the patents were determined to be fully impaired at the date of acquisition 
the impairment charge for the patent portfolio was classified as an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the consolidated statements of operations in for further discussion of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
stock option exchange expense in april we commenced an offering to our employees to voluntarily exchange certain vested and unvested stock options 
under the program  employees holding options to purchase our class a or class b common stock were given the opportunity to exchange certain of their existing options  with exercise prices at or above per share 
in connection with this offering we recorded a stock option exchange expense for employees engaged in research and development and selling  general and administrative activities in the amount of million in no comparable charges were incurred in on may  the offer period ended and we accepted for exchange and cancellation vested eligible options to purchase  shares of class a or class b common stock  with a weighted average exercise price of per share 
in exchange  we issued  fully vested  non forfeitable shares of our class a common stock and recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately million related to the issuance of such vested shares  based on the closing price of our class a common stock on may  of per share 
the  shares were included in our calculation of net loss per share effective as of may  additionally  on may  we accepted for exchange and cancellation unvested eligible options to purchase  shares of class a or class b common stock  with a weighted average exercise price of per share 
in exchange  new options to purchase  shares of our class a common stock were issued on november  the terms and conditions of the new options  including the vesting schedules  were substantially the same as the terms and conditions of the options cancelled 
the exercise price for the new 
table of contents options was per share which was the last reported trading price of our class a common stock on the grant date 
eligible employees members of our board of directors were not eligible to participate in the offer who participated in the offer received  in exchange for the cancellation of vested eligible options  an amount of consideration  represented by fully vested  non forfeitable common stock  equal to the number of shares underlying such vested eligible options  multiplied by the offered value as determined under certain terms and conditions set forth in our offer  divided by the closing price of our class a common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market on may  we concluded that the consideration paid for the eligible options represented substantial consideration as required by eitf issue no 
issues relating to accounting for stock compensation under apb opinion no 
and fasb interpretation no 
 or eitf  as the offered value per vested option was at least equal to the fair value for each eligible option  as determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
in determining the fair value of the eligible options using the black scholes option pricing model  we primarily used the following assumptions i an expected life of approximately four years  ii a volatility of during that expected life  iii a risk free interest rate of  and iv no dividends 
the weighted average offered value per vested option share was certain of our employees held unvested eligible options that were previously assumed by us in connection with acquisitions that were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we had recorded deferred compensation with respect to those options based upon the applicable stock market valuation at the time of acquisition 
to the extent those employees tendered  and we accepted for exchange and cancellation  such assumed eligible options in exchange for new options  we were required to immediately accelerate the amortization of the remaining related deferred compensation previously recorded 
consequently  we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million in may  reflecting the acceleration from future periods of stock based compensation expense 
variable accounting is not required under eitf for eligible options subject to the offer that were not surrendered for cancellation  because i the shares of class a common stock offered as consideration for the surrendered options were fully vested and non forfeitable and ii the number of shares received by an employee who accepted the offer was based on the number of surrendered eligible options multiplied by the offered value per vested option  divided by the fair value of the stock at the date of exchange 
we further concluded that the look back and look forward provisions of paragraph of fin no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
 or fin  applied to the stock options surrendered for cancellation 
if any stock options were granted to participants in the offer within the six months prior to or following may   those stock options would be subject to variable accounting 
as a result of these provisions  we recorded approximately million and million in and  respectively  of stock based compensation expense related to the portion of these variable options that vested during the periods 
in addition to the non cash charges described above  we incurred certain associated employer payroll taxes and professional fees of approximately million in connection with the offering 
employees were responsible for satisfying their portion of the payroll taxes  either through direct cash payment to us or through the sale of a portion of their new shares

these restructuring charges are classified as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations

these subsequent charges were primarily due to the inability to reasonably estimate those costs at the time of the initial implementations as we were still in the process of reviewing many of our facilities to determine where we could consolidate and which locations would no longer be required 
we do not anticipate recording any additional charges under the and restructuring plans

we performed our annual impairment assessment of the carrying value of goodwill recorded in connection with our various acquisitions required under sfas in october and determined that the carrying values of four of our seven reporting units exceeded their estimated fair values 
the four affected reporting units were broadband processors  client server networking  mobile communications and serverworks 
because indicators of impairment existed for these four reporting units  we performed the second step of the test required under sfas to determine the fair value of the goodwill for each of the affected reporting units 
we tested the goodwill of these reporting units for impairment in accordance with sfas  as described above 
based on this assessment  we recorded a charge of billion in october of such charge  million related to the goodwill of our broadband processor reporting unit  million related to the goodwill of our client server networking reporting unit  million related to the goodwill of our mobile communications reporting unit and million related to the goodwill of our serverworks reporting unit 
the primary factors resulting in the impairment charge were i the continued significant economic slowdown in the technology sector and the semiconductor industry  which affected both our operations at that time and our expectations with respect to future revenue  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our stock  and iii unfavorable revisions in revenue and cash flow expectations regarding certain of our acquired businesses 
these acquired businesses were priced based on valuation multiples that were indicative of the value at which businesses were purchased and sold at that time  but were inflated relative to historical and subsequent standards 
in the second and third quarters of demand for servers  wan networking equipment  handheld devices and other products using our chips declined relative to the demand that was anticipated when certain of our purchase acquisitions were consummated 
in addition  we recognized that a sustained decline in demand combined with an oversupply of these products resulted in increased price competition for certain chipsets  giving effect to shrinking profit margins and expected future cash flows for our four affected reporting units 
in response to the existing market conditions  we initiated a 
table of contents restructuring program in the fourth quarter of that included significant headcount reductions  and we decreased our investment in certain target markets that were either performing below our expectations or had low near term growth potential 
as a result  we revised our forecasts of future operating results  which were in turn used in calculating the estimated fair values of the reporting units 
in december and  we acquired over patents related to various technologies  including among others  wireless networking topologies and protocols  dual mode wireless transceivers  power management in integrated circuits  ethernet networking  personal video recording  and voip telephony  for million and million  respectively

in we recorded impairment losses on strategic investments of approximately million 
we recorded a loss of approximately million in february  which was based on information that led us to believe that the investee was proceeding into either a major financial restructuring and or bankruptcy 
this belief was based on our working knowledge of the investee  the fact that we had been solicited by the investee company for continued financings  and the poor performance of venture technology investments in the geographical region 
previously  this privately held investment was reduced to its fair value of million in september based on a then recent round of financing 
we also recorded impairment losses on strategic investments of million in september approximately million related to a second privately held investment 
originally  this investment had high growth prospects and was proposed to be selected for a key customer design win 
this key design win potentially would have generated hundreds of millions in revenue over the next several years and positioned the investee for either an initial public offering or as an acquisition target 
ultimately  the investee did not secure the key design win  and  accordingly  was forced to enter into discussions to obtain a subsequent round of financing at a lower valuation 
therefore  at september  we believed it was necessary to permanently reduce the carrying value of this investment to its fair value  based on the term sheet for the potential subsequent financing 
in addition  approximately million in impairment losses was related to a third privately held investment 
the impairment was caused by an impending financing that was offered at a price substantially lower than our previously reduced carrying value 
earlier  this privately held investment was reduced to its fair value of million in september based on a pricing model using historical financial information 
in september we recorded an additional million in impairment losses relating to other strategic investments using the methodologies described above 
the losses recorded in were offset in part by approximately million in gains realized on sales of an investment in a publicly traded company

as a result of our cumulative losses and the full utilization of our loss carrybacks  we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in and subsequent events in february our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase shares of our class a common stock 
the board approved the repurchase of shares having an aggregate value of up to million from time to time over a period of one year  depending on market conditions 
recent accounting pronouncements in december the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values and does not allow the previously permitted pro forma disclosure as an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  or sfas sfas r is scheduled to be effective beginning in the third quarter of fiscal sfas r allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retroactive recognition  which may date back to the original issuance of sfas or only to interim periods in the year of adoption 
we are currently evaluating these transition methods 
the adoption of the sfas r fair value method will have a significant impact on our reported results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because that will depend on the fair value and number of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the magnitude of the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas assuming the application of the black scholes model as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and pro forma loss per share in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in for such excess tax deductions was million 
no comparable amounts were recorded in and liquidity and capital resources working capital and cash and marketable securities on hand 
the following table presents working capital and cash and marketable securities on hand december  december  increase in thousands working capital cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities long term marketable securities included in working capital our working capital increased in primarily from cash provided by operations and cash proceeds from issuances of common stock in connection with the exercise of employee stock options and our employee stock

accounts receivable decreased million from million in to million in the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of improved shipment linearity and collections during the fourth quarter of we typically bill customers on an open account basis subject to our standard net thirty day payment terms 
if  in the longer term  our revenue continues to increase as it has in the most recent past  it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase 
our accounts receivable could also increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant extended payment terms to customers 
inventories increased million to million in primarily due an expansion of inventory in response to higher levels of purchase orders received from our customers 
in the future  our inventory levels will be determined based on these factors as well as the stage in which our products are in their respective product life cycles and competitive situations in the marketplace 
such considerations are balanced against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
investing activities used cash of million in  which was primarily the result of million used in the net purchase of marketable securities  million net cash paid in purchase transactions  the purchase of million of capital equipment to support our operations and the purchase of million of strategic investments  offset by million in net proceeds received from the sale of strategic investments

cash provided by financing activities was million in  which was primarily the result of million in net proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercises of stock options pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  offset in part by million in repayments of debt and other obligations 
due to the increase in the price of our class a common stock  a greater number of employees exercised stock options and we received more proceeds from the exercise of stock options in than in the timing and number of stock option exercises are not within our control  and in the future we may not generate as much cash from the exercise of stock options as we have in the past 
in addition  we have started to issue to employees a combination of restricted stock units and employee stock options 
unlike the exercise of stock options  the issuance of shares upon vesting of restricted stock units will not result in any cash proceeds and will require the use of cash as we have determined to allow employees to elect to have a portion of their shares 
table of contents issuable during withheld to satisfy withholding taxes and then make corresponding cash payments to the appropriate taxing authorities on each employee s behalf 
obligations and commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of december  payment obligations by year in thousands there after total operating leases inventory and other related purchased obligations other purchase obligations restructuring liabilities accrued settlement payments we lease our facilities and certain engineering design tools and information systems equipment under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through in december we entered into a lease agreement under which our corporate headquarters will move from its present location to a new  larger facility in irvine  california  which will eventually consist of eight buildings with an aggregate of approximately million square feet 
the lease term is a period of ten years and two months beginning after the completion of the first two buildings and related tenant improvements  which is anticipated to occur in the first quarter of the aggregate rent for the term of the lease  approximately million  is included in the table above 
inventory and other related purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments for silicon wafers and assembly and test services 
we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and test services 
due to lengthy subcontractor lead times  we must order these materials and services from these subcontractors well in advance 
we expect to receive and pay for these materials and services within the next six months 
our subcontractor relationships allow for the cancellation of outstanding purchase orders  but require repayment of all expenses incurred through the date of cancellation 
other purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments for lab test equipment  computer hardware  information systems infrastructure and other purchase commitments in the ordinary course of business 
our restructuring liabilities consist of estimated future lease and operating costs on restructured facilities  less offsetting sublease income  if any 
these costs will be paid over the respective lease terms through these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
settlement payments represent payments to be made in connection with certain settlement and license agreements entered into in these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for purposes of the table above  obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we have additional purchase orders not included in the table above that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 
prospective capital needs 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with cash generated from operations and from the exercise of employee stock options  will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  commitments and repurchases of our class a common stock for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next months or to consummate acquisitions of other 
table of contents businesses  assets  products or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we have in effect a universal shelf registration statement on sec form s that allows us to sell  in one or more public offerings  shares of our class a common stock  shares of preferred stock or debt securities  or any combination of such securities  for proceeds in an aggregate amount of up to million 
however  we have not issued nor do we have immediate plans to issue securities to raise capital under the universal shelf registration statement 
if we elect to raise additional funds  we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
although we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
we anticipate that the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans  and product and technology roadmaps  the market acceptance of our products  volume price discounts and customer rebates  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  capital improvements for new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors responses to our products  our relationships with suppliers and customers  the availability of sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our new products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  litigation expenses  settlements and judgments  expenses related to our restructuring plans  changes in our compensation policies  the exercise of stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  use of restricted stock units and the related payment in cash of withholding taxes due from employees  and general economic conditions and specific conditions in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  including the effects of recent international conflicts and the general economic slowdown and related uncertainties 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned future growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products or technologies 

table of contents risk factors before deciding to purchase  hold or sell our common stock  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec  including our subsequent reports on forms q and k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on broadcom  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our class a common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
as a result  we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly net revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
for instance  our net revenue for the three months ended december  decreased by over the level achieved in the three months ended september  if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our class a common stock will likely decline 
fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those listed below and those identified throughout this risk factors section changes in accounting rules  such as the change requiring the recording of expenses for employee stock options and other stock based compensation that is scheduled to go into effect in the third quarter of  a possible adverse outcome in or the settlement of our pending securities litigation or other actual or threatened litigation  the overall cyclicality of  and changing economic and market conditions in  the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory  the gain or loss of a key customer  design win or order  our ability to develop new sources of revenue to replace lost revenue from our declining intel processor based server chipset business  our ability to retain  recruit and hire key executives  technical personnel and other employees in the positions and numbers  with the experience and capabilities  and at the compensation levels that we need to implement our business and product plans  our ability to scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products and services or demand for new products requested by our customers  our ability to timely and accurately predict market requirements and evolving industry standards and to identify opportunities in new markets  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our technologies and products in our target markets  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products  changes in our product or customer mix  the volume of our product sales and pricing concessions on volume sales  fluctuations in the manufacturing yields of our foundries  and other problems or delays in the fabrication  assembly  testing or delivery of our products  and the effects of public health emergencies  natural disasters  terrorist activities  international conflicts and other events beyond our control 

table of contents we continue to derive a larger portion of our product revenue from relatively newer markets 
we expect new product lines to continue to account for a high percentage of our future sales 
some of these markets are immature and unpredictable  and we cannot assure you that these markets will develop into significant opportunities or that we will continue to derive significant revenue from these markets 
based on the limited amount of historical data available to us  it is difficult to predict our future revenue streams from  and the sustainability of  such newer markets 
additionally  rapid changes in our markets and across our product areas make it difficult for us to estimate the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
we believe that we may become subject to some seasonality in demand for our solutions that are designed for use in consumer products  such as desktop and notebook computers  cellphones and other mobile communication devices  other wireless enabled consumer electronics  and satellite and digital cable set top boxes  which may result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
due to all of the foregoing factors  and the other risks discussed in this report  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indicator of future performance 
changes in the accounting treatment of stock options will adversely affect our results of operations 
in december the fasb issued sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values and does not permit pro forma disclosure as an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas r is scheduled to be effective beginning in the third quarter of the adoption of the sfas r fair value method will have a significant adverse impact on our reported results of operations because the stock based compensation expense will be charged directly against our reported earnings 
the impact of our adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because that will depend on the future fair values and number of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas in prior periods  the magnitude of the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas assuming the application of the black scholes model as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and pro forma loss per share in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
continuing worldwide political and economic uncertainties may adversely impact our revenue and profitability 
in the last three years  worldwide economic conditions have experienced a downturn due to slower economic activity  concerns about inflation and deflation  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the telecommunications and broadband communications markets  the lingering effects of the war in iraq  and recent international conflicts and terrorist and military activity 
these conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities  and they could cause us and foreign businesses to slow spending on our products and services  which would delay and lengthen sales cycles 
we recently experienced a slowdown in orders and a reduction in net revenue in the fourth quarter of that we believe was attributable in substantial part to excess inventory held by certain of our customers 
we cannot predict the timing  strength or duration of any economic recovery  worldwide or in the broadband communications markets 
if the economy or the broadband communications markets in which we operate do not recover  our business  financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
any such variations could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
we operate primarily in the semiconductor industry  which is cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards 
from time to time  the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns 
these downturns are characterized by decreases in product demand  excess customer inventories  and accelerated erosion of prices 
these factors could cause substantial fluctuations in our revenue and in our results of operations 
any downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged  and any failure of the industry or the broadband communications markets to fully recover from downturns could seriously impact our 
table of contents revenue and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints  which may affect our ability to ship products 
accordingly  our operating results may vary significantly as a result of the general conditions in the semiconductor industry  which could cause large fluctuations in our stock price 
our stock price is highly volatile 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
in addition we  like many other companies that experience volatility in the market prices of their securities  are engaged in securities litigation 
an adverse outcome in such litigation could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
the market price of our class a common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
since january  our class a common stock has traded at prices as low as and as high as per share 
fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  changes in accounting rules  particularly those related to the expensing of stock options  announcements of changes in our senior management  the gain or loss of one or more significant customers or suppliers  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  the gain or loss of market share in any of our markets  general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  continuing international conflicts and acts of terrorism  changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts  changes in investor perceptions  or changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 
in addition  the market prices of securities of internet related  semiconductor and other technology companies have been especially volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
as noted in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we have been sued in several purported securities class action lawsuits  which have been consolidated into a single action  as well as other securities litigation 
although we believe that those lawsuits are without merit  the plaintiffs in our pending securities class action litigation have asserted that  if liability is found  damages may exceed billion 
trial for our pending securities litigation is scheduled to commence in september an adverse determination in  or the settlement of  our pending securities litigation could require us to pay amounts that exceed the coverage that remains available to us under our directors and officers insurance  which amounts could be substantial 
such an event could have a very significant effect on our business and results of operations  and could materially and adversely affect the price of our stock 
moreover  regardless of the ultimate result  it is likely that the lawsuits will continue to divert management s attention and resources from other matters  which could also adversely affect the price of our stock 
we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties  and if we are unable to accurately predict customer demand  we may hold excess or obsolete inventory  which would reduce our profit margin  or  conversely  we may have insufficient inventory  which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potentially in loss of market share and damaged customer relationships 
we typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments 
customers can generally cancel or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty 
in the recent past  some of our customers have developed excess inventories of their own products and have  as a consequence  deferred purchase orders for our products 
we currently do not have the ability to accurately predict 
table of contents what or how many products our customers will need in the future 
anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face volatile pricing and unpredictable demand for their own products  are increasingly focused more on cash preservation and tighter inventory management  and may be involved in legal proceedings that could affect their ability to buy our products 
however  we place orders with our suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand and  in some instances  may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand 
our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions  each of which may introduce error into our estimates 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to  or at all 
as a result  we would hold excess or obsolete inventory  which would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our financial results 
conversely  if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available  we would forego revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
in addition  any future significant cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return of previously sold products could materially and adversely affect our profit margins  increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
furthermore  we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to a customer 
if a customer refuses to accept shipped products or does not timely pay for these products  we could incur significant charges against our income 
our efforts to develop new revenue sources and replace lost revenue sources for our serverworks business may not be successful 
in the past few years  a significant portion of our total net revenue has been derived from our chipset business for servers based on intel processors 
however  in that business experienced design losses that were attributable  in part  to our ongoing inability to obtain required design information from a third party that is also a competitor 
during the second half of we experienced the first real impact of the long anticipated decline in our intel processor based server chipset business  and we anticipate a steeper decline in that business going forward 
we are now pursuing strategies to diversify our revenue stream beyond intel based platforms and to develop alternative sources of revenue for the business 
our new areas of focus are alternative server i o chipset platforms and the storage market 
during we began to develop server platform products that support the amd opteron tm processor  however  these products are not expected to generate any substantial revenue until the second half of we cannot assure you that these strategies will be successful  and it is likely that we will not be able to make up the loss of revenue from our intel processor based server chipset business in the near term 
if our strategies to reposition our server chipset business are not successful  or if revenues from our other businesses do not increase  our revenue  revenue growth rate and results of operations will be adversely affected 
we may be unable to attract  retain or motivate key senior management and technical personnel  which could seriously harm our business 
on january  scott a 
mcgregor joined broadcom as president and chief executive officer 
mr 
mcgregor succeeded our former president and ceo  alan e 
ross  who retired from these positions upon mr 
mcgregor s arrival but remains a member of the board of directors 
the integration of mr 
mcgregor into our business and operations  and any adjustments or changes that may be implemented by mr 
mcgregor  may require the substantial attention of our board of directors and senior management personnel 
our future success also depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of other key senior management personnel  including our co founder  chairman of the board and chief technical officer  henry samueli  phd  and other senior executives 
we do not have employment agreements with these executives  or any other key employees  that govern the length of their service  although we do have limited retention arrangements in place with certain executives 
the loss of the services of dr 
samueli or certain other key senior management or technical personnel could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for instance  if any of these individuals were to leave our company unexpectedly  we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity during the search for and while any such successor is integrated into our business and operations 
furthermore  our future success depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate senior management and qualified technical personnel  particularly software engineers  digital circuit designers  rf and mixed signal circuit designers and systems applications engineers 
competition for these employees is intense 
if 
table of contents we are unable to attract  retain and motivate such personnel in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis  we will experience difficulty in implementing our current business and product plans 
in that event  we may be unable to successfully meet competitive challenges or to exploit potential market opportunities  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
stock options generally comprise a significant portion of our compensation packages for all employees 
in april and may we conducted a stock option exchange offer to address the substantial decline in the price of our class a common stock over the preceding two years and to improve our ability to retain key employees 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to attract  retain and motivate employees if our class a common stock experiences another substantial price decline 
we have also modified our compensation policies by increasing cash compensation to certain employees and instituting awards of restricted stock units  while simultaneously reducing awards of stock options 
this modification of our compensation policies and the fasb requirement to expense the fair value of stock options awarded to employees beginning in the third quarter of will increase our operating expenses 
we cannot be certain that the changes in our compensation policies will improve our ability to attract  retain and motivate employees 
our inability to attract and retain additional key employees and the increase in stock based compensation expense could each have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products and services or to the demand for new products requested by our customers  we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities  and our business could be materially and adversely affected 
to achieve our business objectives  we anticipate that we will need to continue to expand 
we have experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion in the past 
through internal growth and acquisitions  we significantly increased the scope of our operations and expanded our workforce  from  employees  including contractors  as of december  to  employees  including contractors  as of december  this past growth has placed  and any future growth is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our management personnel  systems and resources 
to implement our current business and product plans  we will need to continue to expand  train  manage and motivate our workforce 
all of these endeavors will require substantial management effort 
although we have recently implemented a new enterprise resource planning  or erp  system to help us improve our planning and management processes and a new human resources management  or hrm  system  we anticipate that we will also need to continue to implement a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  such as a new material requirements planning  or mrp  system  as well as additional procedures and other internal management systems 
in addition  to support our growth we recently signed a lease agreement under which we will relocate our headquarters and irvine operations to new  larger facilities that will enable us to centralize all of our irvine employees and operations on one campus 
this relocation is currently anticipated to begin in the first quarter of we may also engage in other relocations of our employees or operations from time to time 
such relocations could result in temporary disruptions of our operations or a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations  we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities  and our business could be materially and adversely affected 
because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue  the loss of a key customer could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business 
in addition  if we are unable to continue to sell existing and new products to our key customers in significant quantities or to attract new significant customers  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
we have derived a substantial portion of our past revenue from sales to a relatively small number of customers 
as a result  the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
sales to our five largest customers represented approximately  and of our net revenue n  and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further 
table of contents details 
we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in and for the foreseeable future 
the identity of our largest customers and their respective contributions to our net revenue have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period 
we may not be able to maintain or increase sales to certain of our key customers for a variety of reasons  including the following most of our customers can stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no penalty  our agreements with our customers typically do not require them to purchase a minimum quantity of our products  many of our customers have pre existing or concurrent relationships with our current or potential competitors that may affect their decisions to purchase our products  our customers face intense competition from other manufacturers that do not use our products  and some of our customers offer or may offer products that compete with our products 
in addition  our longstanding relationships with some larger customers may also deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products 
to attract new customers or retain existing customers  we may offer certain customers favorable prices on our products 
we may have to offer the same lower prices to certain of our customers who have contractual most favored nation pricing arrangements 
in that event  our average selling prices and gross margins would decline 
the loss of a key customer  a reduction in sales to any key customer or our inability to attract new significant customers could seriously impact our revenue and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
our future success depends in significant part on strategic relationships with certain customers 
if we cannot maintain these relationships or if these customers develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solutions instead of buying our products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
in the past  we have relied in significant part on our strategic relationships with customers that are technology leaders in our target markets 
we intend to pursue the formation of these strategic relationships but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
these relationships often require us to develop new products that may involve significant technological challenges 
our customers frequently place considerable pressure on us to meet their tight development schedules 
accordingly  we may have to devote a substantial amount of our limited resources to our strategic relationships  which could detract from or delay our completion of other important development projects 
delays in development could impair our relationships with our strategic customers and negatively impact sales of the products under development 
moreover  it is possible that our customers may develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solution for products that they currently buy from us 
if that happens  our sales would decline and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our acquisition strategy may be dilutive to existing shareholders  result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations  and result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies or businesses 
a key element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses  assets  products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings  expand our market coverage  increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities 
between january  and december   we acquired companies and certain assets of one other business 
we continually evaluate and explore strategic opportunities as they arise  including business combination transactions  strategic partnerships  and the purchase or sale of assets  including tangible and intangible assets such as intellectual property 
we also continually evaluate the performance and prospects of our various businesses and possible adjustments in our businesses to reflect changes in our assessment of their performance and prospects 
acquisitions may require significant capital infusions  typically entail many risks  and could result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information 
table of contents systems of acquired companies or businesses 
we have in the past and may in the future experience delays in the timing and successful integration of an acquired company s technologies and product development through volume production  unanticipated costs and expenditures  changing relationships with customers  suppliers and strategic partners  or contractual  intellectual property or employment issues 
in addition  key personnel of an acquired company may decide not to work for us 
the acquisition of another company or its products and technologies may also require us to enter into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience 
these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  harm our reputation and increase our expenses 
these challenges are magnified as the size of the acquisition increases 
furthermore  these challenges would be even greater if we acquired a business or entered into a business combination transaction with a company that was larger and more difficult to integrate than the typical size of the companies we have historically acquired 
acquisitions may require large one time charges and can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities  adverse tax consequences  deferred compensation charges  and the recording and later amortization of amounts related to deferred compensation and certain purchased intangible assets  any of which items could negatively impact our results of operations 
in addition  we may record goodwill in connection with an acquisition and incur goodwill impairment charges in the future 
any of these charges could cause the price of our class a common stock to decline 
acquisitions or asset purchases made entirely or partially for cash may reduce our cash reserves 
alternatively  we may issue equity or convertible debt securities in connection with an acquisition 
we have in effect an acquisition shelf registration statement on sec form s that enables us to issue up to million shares of our class a common stock in one or more acquisition transactions that we may enter into from time to time 
any additional issuance of equity or convertible debt securities may be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we may issue could have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
for example  as a consequence of the prior pooling of interests accounting rules  the securities issued in nine of our prior acquisitions were shares of class b common stock  which have voting rights superior to our publicly traded class a common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any pending or future acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from these acquisitions 
we may not be able to find suitable acquisition opportunities that are available at attractive valuations  if at all 
even if we do find suitable acquisition opportunities  we may not be able to consummate the acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms  and any decline in the price of our class a common stock may make it significantly more difficult and expensive to initiate or consummate additional acquisitions 
we must keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards in the semiconductor industry and broadband communications markets to remain competitive 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards and our customers changing demands 
we sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and increasing demand for higher levels of integration and smaller process geometries 
our past sales and profitability have resulted  to a large extent  from our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products incorporating the new standards and technologies 
our ability to adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards  and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards  will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth 
if new industry standards emerge  our products or our customers products could become unmarketable or obsolete  and we could lose market share 
we may also have to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards 
in addition  our target markets continue to undergo rapid growth and consolidation 
a significant slowdown in any of these broadband communications markets could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success will also depend on the ability of our customers to develop new products and enhance existing products for the broadband communications markets and to introduce and promote those products successfully 
these rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards make it difficult to formulate a long term growth strategy 
table of contents because the semiconductor industry and broadband communications markets may not continue to develop to the extent or in the time periods that we anticipate 
we have invested substantial resources in emerging technologies that did not achieve the market acceptance that we had expected 
if new markets do not develop as we anticipate  or if our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner or to achieve market acceptance of our new products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our future success is dependent upon our ability to develop new semiconductor solutions for existing and new markets  introduce these products in a cost effective and timely manner  and convince leading equipment manufacturers to select these products for design into their own new products 
our historical quarterly results have been  and we expect that our future results will continue to be  dependent on the introduction of a relatively small number of new products and the timely completion and delivery of those products to customers 
the development of new silicon devices is highly complex  and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and lower than anticipated manufacturing yields in the early production of such products 
our ability to develop and deliver new products successfully will depend on various factors  including our ability to timely and accurately predict market requirements and evolving industry standards  accurately define new products  timely and accurately identify opportunities in new markets  timely complete and introduce new product designs  timely qualify and obtain industry interoperability certification of our products and the products of our customers into which our products will be incorporated  obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials  achieve high manufacturing yields  shift our products to smaller geometry process technologies to achieve lower cost and higher levels of design integration  and gain market acceptance of our products and our customers products 
in some of our businesses  our ability to develop and deliver next generation products successfully depends in part on access to information from companies that are our competitors 
if we are not able to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner  we will be unable to attract new customers or to retain our existing customers as these customers may transition to other companies that can meet their product development needs  which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
as our international business expands  we are increasingly exposed to various legal  business  political and economic risks associated with our international operations 
we currently obtain substantially all of our manufacturing  assembly and testing services from suppliers located outside the united states 
in addition  approximately of our net revenue in was derived from sales to independent customers outside the united states 
we also frequently ship products to our domestic customers international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors 
products shipped to international destinations  primarily in asia  represented approximately of our net revenue in in we established an international distribution center in singapore that includes an engineering design center 
we also undertake design  development activities in belgium  canada  china  france  india  israel  the netherlands  taiwan and the united kingdom 
in addition  we undertake various sales and marketing activities through regional offices in several other countries 
we intend to continue to expand our international business activities and to open other design and operational centers abroad 
the recent war in iraq and the lingering effects of terrorist attacks in the united states and abroad  the resulting heightened security and the increasing risk of extended international military conflicts may adversely impact our international sales and could make our 
table of contents international operations more expensive 
international operations are subject to many other inherent risks  including but not limited to political  social and economic instability  exposure to different legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  natural disasters and public health emergencies  nationalization of business and blocking of cash flows  trade and travel restrictions  the imposition of governmental controls and restrictions  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  import and export license requirements and restrictions of the united states and each other country in which we operate  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  foreign technical standards  changes in taxation and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities or delayed revenue recognition  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any of the factors described above may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our foreign sales 
we currently operate under tax holidays in certain foreign jurisdictions 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to enjoy such tax holidays or realize any net tax benefits from such tax holidays 
the seasonality of international sales and economic conditions in our primary overseas markets  particularly in asia  may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad 
all of our international sales to date have been denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies 
we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities 
we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  which could harm our competitive position 
our success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we primarily rely on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies and processes 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes  it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain  copy  use or disclose our technologies and processes 
we hold more than us patents and have filed more than  additional us patent applications 
however  we cannot assure you that any additional patents will be issued 
even if a new patent is issued  the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  any of our existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
as such  any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection 
we may not have foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications 
even if foreign patents are granted  effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available 
if our patents do not adequately protect our technology  our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours 
our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
some or all of our patents have in the past been licensed and likely will in the future be licensed to certain of our competitors through cross license agreements 
moreover  because we have participated in developing various industry standards  we may be required to license some of our patents to others  including competitors  who develop products based on those standards 
certain of our software as well as that of our customers may be derived from so called open source software that is generally made available to the public by its authors and or other third parties 
such open source 
table of contents software is often made available to us under licenses  such as the gnu general public license  or gpl  which impose certain obligations on us in the event we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software 
these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public  and or license such derivative works under a particular type of license  rather than the forms of license customarily used to protect our intellectual property 
in addition  there is little or no legal precedent for interpreting the terms of certain of these open source licenses  including the determination of which works are subject to the terms of such licenses 
while we believe we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software  in the event the copyright holder of any open source software were to successfully establish in court that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work  we could be required to release the source code of that work to the public and or stop distribution of that work 
with respect to our proprietary software  we generally license such software under terms that prohibit combining it with open source software as described above 
despite these restrictions  parties may combine broadcom proprietary software with open source software without our authorization  in which case we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and strategic partners 
we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  parties may attempt to copy  disclose  obtain or use our products  services or technology without our authorization 
also  former employees may seek employment with our business partners  customers or competitors  and we cannot assure you that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
additionally  departing or former employees or third parties could attempt to penetrate our computer systems and networks to misappropriate our proprietary information and technology or interrupt our business 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate  counter or ameliorate these techniques 
as a result  our technologies and processes may be misappropriated  particularly in foreign countries where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  some of our customers have entered into agreements with us that grant them the right to use our proprietary technology if we ever fail to fulfill our obligations  including product supply obligations  under those agreements  and if we do not correct the failure within a specified time period 
moreover  we often incorporate the intellectual property of strategic customers into our own designs  and have certain obligations not to use or disclose their intellectual property without their authorization 
we cannot assure you that our efforts to prevent the misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers will succeed 
we have in the past engaged and may in the future engage in litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets  or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
this litigation has been and will likely continue to be very expensive and time consuming 
additionally  any litigation can divert the attention of management and other key employees from the operation of the business  which could negatively impact our operations 
third party claims of infringement or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products  require us to redesign our products or seek licenses from third parties  and seriously harm our operating results 
in addition  the defense of such claims could result in significant costs and divert the attention of our management or other key employees 
companies in the semiconductor industry often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights 
from time to time  we have received  and may continue to receive  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights 
moreover  in several instances we have been engaged in litigation with parties who claimed that we infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets 
in addition  we or our customers may be sued by other parties who claim that our products have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets  or who may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents 
an adverse determination in any of these types of disputes could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products  could increase our costs of revenue and could expose us to 
table of contents significant liability 
any of these claims may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in a patent or trade secret action  a court could issue a preliminary or permanent injunction that would require us to withdraw or recall certain products from the market or redesign certain products offered for sale or under development 
in addition  we may be liable for damages for past infringement and royalties for future use of the technology  and we may be liable for treble damages if infringement is found to have been willful 
we may also have to indemnify some customers and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that our products or activities have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused another party s proprietary rights 
we have received requests from certain customers and strategic partners to include increasingly broad indemnification provisions in our agreements with them 
these indemnification provisions may  in some circumstances  result in liability for combinations of components or system level designs and consequential damages and or lost profits 
even if claims against us are not valid or successfully asserted  these claims could result in significant costs and a diversion of the attention of management and other key employees to defend 
additionally  we have sought and may in the future seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights and have granted and may in the future grant a license to certain of our intellectual property rights to a third party in connection with a cross license agreement or a settlement of claims or actions asserted against us 
however  we may not be able to obtain such a license on commercially reasonable terms  if we are able to obtain one at all 
our products may contain technology provided to us by third parties 
because we did not develop such technology ourselves  we may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
our suppliers and licensors may not be required to indemnify us in the event that a claim of infringement is asserted against us  or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount  above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages 
we will have difficulty selling our products if customers do not design our products into their product offerings or if our customers product offerings are not commercially successful 
our products are generally incorporated into our customers products at the design stage 
as a result  we rely on equipment manufacturers to select our products to be designed into their products 
without these design wins  it becomes difficult to sell our products 
we often incur significant expenditures on the development of a new product without any assurance that an equipment manufacturer will select our product for design into its own product 
additionally  in some instances  we are dependent on third parties to obtain or provide information that we need to achieve a design win 
some of these third parties may be our competitors and  accordingly  may not supply this information to us on a timely basis  if at all 
once an equipment manufacturer designs a competitor s product into its product offering  it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our products to that customer because changing suppliers involves significant cost  time  effort and risk for the customer 
furthermore  even if an equipment manufacturer designs one of our products into its product offering  we cannot be assured that its product will be commercially successful or that we will receive any revenue from that product 
sales of our products largely depend on the commercial success of our customers products 
our customers are typically not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to stop using our products if their own products are not commercially successful or for any other reason 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve design wins or that our customers equipment incorporating our products will ever be commercially successful 
we face intense competition in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  which could reduce our market share in existing markets and affect our entry into new markets 
the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets are intensely competitive 
we expect competition to continue to increase as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter our target markets 
we currently compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of integrated circuits and related applications in our target markets 
we also compete with suppliers of system level and motherboard level solutions incorporating integrated circuits that are proprietary or sourced from manufacturers other than broadcom 
this competition has resulted and may continue to result in declining average selling prices for some of our products 
in all of our target markets we also may face competition from 
table of contents newly established competitors  suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies  and customers who choose to develop their own semiconductor solutions 
we also expect to encounter further consolidation in the markets in which we compete 
many of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
existing or new competitors may also develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features and functionality  lower power requirements  greater levels of integration or lower cost 
increased competition has resulted in and is likely to continue to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share in certain markets 
in some of our businesses  we are dependent on competitors for information for the timely development of next generation products  and such information may not always be given to us on a timely basis  if at all 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully against current or new competitors 
if we do not compete successfully  we may lose market share in our existing markets and our revenues may fail to increase or may decline 
we depend on six independent foundry subcontractors to manufacture substantially all of our current products  and any failure to secure and maintain sufficient foundry capacity could materially and adversely affect our business 
we do not own or operate a fabrication facility 
six third party foundry subcontractors located in asia manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor devices in current production 
availability of foundry capacity has at times in the past been reduced due to strong demand 
in addition  a recurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  or the occurrence of a significant outbreak of avian influenza among humans or another public health emergency in asia could further affect the production capabilities of our manufacturers by resulting in quarantines or closures 
if we are unable to secure sufficient capacity at our existing foundries  or in the event of a quarantine or closure at any of these foundries  our revenues  cost of revenues and results of operations would be negatively impacted 
in september two of our foundries principal facilities were affected by a significant earthquake in taiwan 
as a consequence of this earthquake  they suffered power outages and equipment damage that impaired their wafer deliveries  which  together with strong demand  resulted in wafer shortages and higher wafer pricing industrywide 
if any of our foundries experiences a shortage in capacity  suffers any damage to its facilities  experiences power outages  suffers an adverse outcome in pending litigation  or encounters financial difficulties or any other disruption of foundry capacity  we may need to qualify an alternative foundry in a timely manner 
even our current foundries need to have new manufacturing processes qualified if there is a disruption in an existing process 
we typically require several months to qualify a new foundry or process before we can begin shipping products from it 
if we cannot accomplish this qualification in a timely manner  we may experience a significant interruption in supply of the affected products 
because we rely on outside foundries with limited capacity  we face several significant risks  including a lack of guaranteed wafer supply and potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices  limited control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  and the unavailability of  or potential delays in obtaining access to  key process technologies 
in addition  the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technologically demanding process 
although we work closely with our foundries to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields  our foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields 
this often occurs during the production of new products or the installation and start up of new process technologies 
poor 
table of contents yields from our foundries could result in product shortages or delays in product shipments  which could seriously harm our relationships with our customers and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
the ability of each foundry to provide us with semiconductor devices is limited by its available capacity and existing obligations 
although we have entered into contractual commitments to supply specified levels of products to some of our customers  we do not have a long term volume purchase agreement or a significant guaranteed level of production capacity with any of our foundries 
foundry capacity may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices 
availability of foundry capacity has in the recent past been reduced from time to time due to strong demand 
we place our orders on the basis of our customers purchase orders or our forecast of customer demand  and the foundries can allocate capacity to the production of other companies products and reduce deliveries to us on short notice 
it is possible that foundry customers that are larger and better financed than we are  or that have long term agreements with our main foundries  may induce our foundries to reallocate capacity to them 
this reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we need 
although we use six independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor products  most of our components are not manufactured at more than one foundry at any given time  and our products typically are designed to be manufactured in a specific process at only one of these foundries 
accordingly  if one of our foundries is unable to provide us with components as needed  we could experience significant delays in securing sufficient supplies of those components 
also  our third party foundries typically migrate capacity to newer  state of the art manufacturing processes on a regular basis  which may create capacity shortages for our products designed to be manufactured on an older process 
we cannot assure you that any of our existing or new foundries will be able to produce integrated circuits with acceptable manufacturing yields  or that our foundries will be able to deliver enough semiconductor devices to us on a timely basis  or at reasonable prices 
these and other related factors could impair our ability to meet our customers needs and have a material and adverse effect on our operating results 
although we may utilize new foundries for other products in the future  in using new foundries we will be subject to all of the risks described in the foregoing paragraphs with respect to our current foundries 
we depend on third party subcontractors to assemble  obtain packaging materials for  and test substantially all of our current products 
if we lose the services of any of our subcontractors or if these subcontractors are unable to obtain sufficient packaging materials  shipments of our products may be disrupted  which could harm our customer relationships and adversely affect our net sales 
we do not own or operate an assembly or test facility 
seven third party subcontractors located in asia assemble  obtain packaging materials for  and test substantially all of our current products 
because we rely on third party subcontractors to perform these functions  we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules and quality assurance 
this lack of control has resulted  and could in the future result  in product shortages or quality assurance problems that could delay shipments of our products or increase our manufacturing  assembly or testing costs 
in the recent past we and others in our industry experienced a shortage in the supply of packaging substrates that we use for our products 
if our third party subcontractors are unable to obtain sufficient packaging materials for our products in a timely manner  we may experience a significant product shortage or delay in product shipments  which could seriously harm our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our net sales 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis 
if any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties  suffers any damage to its facilities  experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity  we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner 
due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers  we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components 
any problems that we may encounter with the delivery  quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we are continuing to develop relationships with additional third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products 

table of contents however  even if we use these new subcontractors  we will continue to be subject to all of the risks described above 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration  which may result in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
to remain competitive  we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries 
this transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products and to redesign some products as well as standard cells and other integrated circuit designs that we may use in multiple products 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs 
currently most of our products are manufactured in 
micron  
micron  
micron and 
micron geometry processes 
in addition  we have begun to migrate some of our products to nanometer process technology 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes  which resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our existing foundry relationships or develop new ones 
if our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition  we could experience reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses  all of which could harm our relationships with our customers and our results of operations 
as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality  as well as customer and third party intellectual property  into our products 
however  we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis  or at all 
moreover  even if we are able to achieve higher levels of design integration  such integration may have a short term adverse impact on our operating results  as we may reduce our revenue by integrating the functionality of multiple chips into a single chip 
our products typically have lengthy sales cycles 
a customer may decide to cancel or change its product plans  which could cause us to lose anticipated sales 
in addition  our average product life cycles tend to be short and  as a result  we may hold excess or obsolete inventory that could adversely affect our operating results 
after we have developed and delivered a product to a customer  the customer will usually test and evaluate our product prior to designing its own equipment to incorporate our product 
our customers may need three to more than six months to test  evaluate and adopt our product and an additional three to more than nine months to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our product 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and make investments in inventory until the time that we generate revenue from these products 
it is possible that we may never generate any revenue from these products after incurring such expenditures 
even if a customer selects our product to incorporate into its equipment  we have no assurances that the customer will ultimately market and sell its equipment or that such efforts by our customer will be successful 
the delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel or change its product plans 
such a cancellation or change in plans by a customer could cause us to lose sales that we had anticipated 
in addition  anticipated sales could be materially and adversely affected if a significant customer curtails  reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release equipment that contains our products 
while our sales cycles are typically long  our average product life cycles tend to be short as a result of the rapidly changing technology environment in which we operate 
as a result  the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not generate material revenue for us  and from time to time  we may need to write off excess and obsolete inventory 
if we incur significant marketing expenses and investments in inventory in the future that we are not able to recover  and we are not able to compensate for those expenses  our operating results could be 
table of contents adversely affected 
in addition  if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory  our operating results would be harmed 
the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses and in undetected defects or bugs  which could damage our reputation with current or prospective customers and adversely affect the market acceptance of new products 
highly complex products such as the products that we offer frequently contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have previously experienced  and may in the future experience  these defects and bugs 
if any of our products contains defects or bugs  or has reliability  quality or compatibility problems  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales or shipment of our products to our customers 
to alleviate these problems  we may have to invest significant capital and other resources 
although our products are tested by us and our suppliers and customers  it is possible that our new products will contain defects or bugs 
if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or field replacement costs 
these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others 
in addition  system and handset providers who purchase components may require that we assume liability for defects associated with products produced by their manufacturing subcontractors and require that we provide a warranty for defects or other problems which may arise at the system level 
moreover  we would likely lose  or experience a delay in  market acceptance of the affected product or products  and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers 
the six primary independent foundries upon which we rely to manufacture substantially all of our current products and our california and singapore facilities are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
two of the six third party foundries upon which we rely to manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor devices are located in taiwan and one such third party foundry is located in japan 
both taiwan and japan have experienced significant earthquakes in the past and could be subject to additional earthquakes 
any earthquake or other natural disaster  such as a tsunami  in a country in which any of our foundries is located could significantly disrupt our foundries production capabilities and could result in our experiencing a significant delay in delivery  or substantial shortage  of wafers and possibly in higher wafer prices 
our california facilities  including our principal executive offices  are located near major earthquake fault lines  and our international distribution center is located in singapore  which could be subject to an earthquake  tsunami or other natural disaster 
if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of our facilities is located  it could significantly disrupt our operations 
changes in current or future laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations by the fcc  other federal or state agencies or foreign governments could impede the sale of our products or otherwise harm our business 
the federal communications commission has broad jurisdiction over each of our target markets 
although current fcc regulations and the laws and regulations of other federal or state agencies are not directly applicable to our products  they do apply to much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated 
fcc regulatory policies that affect the ability of cable operators or telephone companies to offer certain services to their customers or other aspects of their business may impede sales of our products 
accordingly  the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which they operate may  in turn  materially and adversely impact our business 
for example  in the past we have experienced delays when products incorporating our chips failed to comply with fcc emissions specifications 
we and our customers may also be subject to regulation by countries other than the united states 
foreign governments may impose tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on components that we obtain from non domestic suppliers and may impose export restrictions on products that we sell internationally 
these tariffs  duties or restrictions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial 
table of contents condition and results of operations 
changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the united states or elsewhere could also materially and adversely affect our business 
if our internal controls over financial reporting do not comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  our business and stock price could be adversely affected 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each year beginning in  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in all annual reports beginning with this report 
section also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  and report on  management s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting 
our management  including our ceo and cfo  does not expect that our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  involving the company have been  or will be  detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the controls 
the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
although our management has determined  and our independent registered public accounting firm has attested  that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december   we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal controls in the future 
a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting would require management and our independent registered public accounting firm to evaluate our internal controls as ineffective 
if our internal controls over financial reporting are not considered adequate  we may experience a loss of public confidence  which could have an adverse effect on our business and our stock price 
we may experience difficulties in implementing or enhancing new information systems 
we recently implemented a new erp information system to manage our business operations and a new hrm system  and we intend to implement a new mrp information system 
the implementation and migration to a new mrp system could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner accept and process customer orders  receive inventory and ship products  invoice and collect receivables  place purchase orders and pay invoices  and process other business transactions related to the order entry  purchasing  and  supply chain processes within a new mrp system 
any such disruption could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and the market price of our class a common stock 
in addition  if any of the providers of our information systems do not choose to continue supporting the systems we have implemented  we may be forced to switch to new information systems  which could result in further disruptions 
we may seek to raise additional capital through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities or by borrowing money  but additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with cash generated by operations and from the exercise of employee stock options will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  commitments and repurchases of our class a common stock for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our 
table of contents activities beyond the next months or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we have in effect a universal shelf registration statement on sec form s that allows us to sell  in one or more public offerings  shares of our class a common stock  shares of preferred stock or debt securities  or any combination of such securities  for proceeds in an aggregate amount of up to million 
however  we have not issued nor do we have immediate plans to issue securities to raise capital under the universal shelf registration statement 
if we elect to raise additional funds  we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
our co founders  directors  executive officers and their affiliates can control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders  and accordingly we will not be able to engage in certain transactions without their approval 
as of december  our co founders  directors  executive officers and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock and held of the total voting power held by our shareholders 
accordingly  these shareholders currently have enough voting power to control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders 
these matters include the election of our board of directors  the issuance of additional shares of class b common stock  and the approval of most significant corporate transactions  including a merger  consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets 
in particular  as of december  our two founders  dr 
henry t 
nicholas iii  who is no longer an officer or director of the company  and dr 
henry samueli  our chairman of the board and chief technical officer  beneficially owned a total of approximately of our outstanding common stock and held of the total voting power held by our shareholders 
because of their significant voting stock ownership  we will not be able to engage in certain transactions  and our shareholders will not be able to effect certain actions or transactions  without the approval of one or both of these shareholders 
these actions and transactions include changes in control of our board of directors  mergers  and the sale of control of our company by means of a tender offer  open market purchases or other purchases of our class a common stock  or otherwise 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
in addition  we have in the past issued and may in the future issue shares of class b common stock in connection with certain acquisitions  upon exercise of certain stock options  and for other purposes 
class b shares have superior voting rights entitling the holder to ten votes for each share held on matters that we submit to a shareholder vote as compared with one vote per share in the case of our class a common stock 
our board of directors also has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of shares of our preferred stock and to issue such shares without a shareholder vote 
it is possible that the provisions in our charter documents  the exercise of supervoting rights by holders of our class b common stock  our co founders  directors and officers ownership of a majority of the class b common stock  or the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock or additional shares of class b common stock may prevent or discourage third parties from acquiring us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
in addition  these factors may discourage third parties from bidding for our class a common stock at a premium over the market price for our stock 
these factors may also materially and adversely affect voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock and the market price of our class a common stock 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of december  the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
our marketable debt securities  consisting of us treasury and agency obligations  commercial paper  corporate notes and bonds  time deposits  foreign notes and certificates of deposits  are generally classified as held to maturity and are stated at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity 
in addition  in the past certain of our short term marketable debt securities were classified as available for sale and were stated at fair value  which was equal to cost due to the short term maturity of these securities 
in the event that there were to be a difference between fair value and cost in any of our available for sale securities  unrealized holding gains and losses on these investments would be reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
our investment policy for marketable debt securities requires that all securities mature in three years or less  with a weighted average maturity of no longer than one year 
as of december  the carrying value and fair value of these securities were approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of our marketable debt securities fluctuates based on changes in market conditions and interest rates  however  given the short term maturities  we do not believe these instruments are subject to significant market or interest rate risk 
the carrying value  maturity and estimated fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities as of december  and  respectively  were as follows carrying fair value maturity value december  december  in thousands  except interest rates investments cash equivalents weighted average interest rate marketable debt securities weighted average interest rate carrying fair value maturity value december  december  in thousands  except interest rates investments cash equivalents weighted average interest rate marketable debt securities weighted average interest rate our strategic equity investments are generally classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss for our publicly traded investments 
we have also invested in privately held companies  the majority of which can still be considered to be in the start up or development stage 
we make investments in key business partners and other industry participants to establish strategic relationships  expand existing relationships  and achieve a return on our investment 
these investments are inherently risky  as the markets for the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages 
table of contents and may never materialize 
likewise  the development projects of these companies may not be successful 
in addition  early stage companies often fail to succeed for various other reasons 
consequently  we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
as of december   the carrying and fair value of our strategic investments was approximately million
