item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement of financial statements we have restated our consolidated financial statements for fiscal and  and the previously reported quarters of fiscal and fiscal with respect to errors related to i the improper accounting for the tax benefits created from the utilization of operating loss carryforwards that existed prior to the acquisition of romaco in and ii the understatement of future tax benefits primarily from intercompany transactions impacting several taxing jurisdictions 
the determination to restate these consolidated financial statements was made as a result of our assessment that these tax items would be considered material to the consolidated financial statements for the full fiscal year and previously reported quarters of fiscal the tax adjustments associated with the above corrections increased our fiscal net income by million  or per diluted share  and increased our fiscal net income by million  or per diluted share 
further information on the nature and impact of these adjustments to fiscal year and as well as the impact to our quarterly financial information for fiscal and is provided at note  restatement of financial statements  to our consolidated financial statements 
the impact of the restatement on the results of operations for fiscal years and is shown in the table below in thousands  except per share amounts twelve months ended august  decrease in income tax expense from adjustments net income as previously reported net income as restated net income per share as previously reported basic diluted net income per share as restated basic diluted overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered  application critical equipment and systems for the pharmaceutical  energy and industrial markets worldwide

table of contents results of operations the following tables present components of our consolidated statement of operations and segment information 
consolidated sales cost of sales gross profit sg a expenses amortization other ebit by segment in thousands  except percents pharmaceutical sales ebit ebit energy sales ebit ebit industrial sales ebit ebit total sales ebit ebit during fiscal  we initiated a restructuring program for our pharmaceutical segment 
the restructuring plan was initiated to improve the profitability of the pharmaceutical segment in light of the current worldwide economic conditions that were affecting this segment 
the restructuring plan included the following plant closures one of two reactor systems facilities in italy  a reactor systems facility in mexico and the unipac facility of romaco in italy 
headcount reductions to support the reactor systems product line reorganization and to bring the personnel costs in line with the current level of business 
headcount reductions at romaco with the unipac integration into the macofar facility and removal of duplicate administrative costs at other locations 
the status of the restructuring activities is as follows the unipac facility and the reactor systems facility in italy have been sold 
the mexico facility will be closed soon and we have negotiated a contract for the sale of the facility 
headcount has been reduced by as a result of the restructuring activities  we recorded costs totaling approximately million in the pharmaceutical segment 
the net costs in fiscal were comprised of the following 
table of contents million of termination benefits related to the aforementioned headcount reductions 
million to write down inventory and million to write off identifiable intangibles related to discontinued product lines 
the inventory charge is included in cost of sales 
million to write down to estimated net realizable value the facilities that we exited and prepare the facilities for sale 
million to write down equipment to net realizable value  relocate equipment  relocate employees and other costs 
the total cash outlays in connection with the restructuring plan were million 
the sale of the reactor systems facility in italy generated cash of million in the third quarter  and the sale of the unipac facility generated cash of million in the second quarter 
the mexico facility that will be closed is owned by us and will be sold 
we expect the facility sale to generate approximately million of additional pretax cash proceeds  which exceeds the recorded book value of this facility by approximately million 
we have negotiated a contract for the sale of the mexico facility but are unable to predict the final transaction date due to ongoing due diligence procedures by the purchaser 
other asset dispositions during fiscal  we also sold the inventory and equipment related to our lined pipe and fitting product line to crane  co 
in addition  we sold an underutilized facility of our industrial segment 
the cash proceeds received from these asset sales was million 
the loss recognized in as a result of these asset sales was million and is reflected in our industrial segment 
the loss is primarily a result of the write down of the land and building in charleston  west virginia to net realizable value 
the facility in charleston  west virginia is where the lined pipe and fitting product line was manufactured 
based on the results of a third party appraisal  we expect the facility sale to generate approximately million of pretax cash proceeds 
the facility is in excellent condition and is believed to be readily marketable  but we are unable to predict the specific timing of the sale of the facility 

table of contents fiscal year ended august  compared with fiscal year ended august  net sales sales for the fiscal year ended august  were million compared with million in fiscal the impact of exchange rates  the translation of sales from non us operations into non us dollars  caused an increase in sales of million  resulting in a sales increase of million on a constant dollar basis 
the pharmaceutical segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the impact of exchange rates increased sales by million resulting in a decrease of million on a constant dollar basis 
consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry and weak economic conditions in europe have caused excess production capacity in the pharmaceutical industry 
the purchase of capital equipment by these pharmaceutical companies has declined and new projects are being delayed  which has negatively impacted sales of our products 
the energy segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
sales in this segment continue to increase due to the high prices for oil and natural gas which results in increased investment in drilling and exploration equipment 
the industrial segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
our sales to the chemical processing market have improved during fiscal as this market shows signs of recovery 
however  offsetting this is lower sales into the municipal wastewater treatment market caused by fewer projects 
earnings before interest and income taxes ebit the company s operating performance is evaluated using several measures 
one of those measures  ebit is income before interest and income taxes and is reconciled to net income on our consolidated statement of operations 
we evaluate performance of our business segments and allocate resources based on ebit 
ebit is not  however  a measure of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating results 
ebit is not a measure of cash available for use by management 
consolidated ebit for fiscal was million compared with million in fiscal included in the current year s ebit are costs associated with the restructuring of our pharmaceutical segment of million and costs associated with asset dispositions in our industrial segment of million 
the pharmaceutical segment had ebit of negative million in fiscal compared with positive million in fiscal the aforementioned million decline in constant dollar sales caused a million reduction in ebit 
in addition  aggressive pricing in europe and underutilization of our production facilities have caused a reduction in ebit of million  and restructuring costs were million higher in fiscal offsetting these items are realized cost savings of million as a result of the restructuring programs 
the industrial segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the fiscal ebit includes losses on asset dispositions and asset write downs of million that was discussed previously 
the remaining decline in ebit is a result of lower aftermarket business and higher medical and pension costs in fiscal the energy segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with million in the fiscal  an increase of million 
the energy segment ebit increase was due to the sales volume increase mentioned above 
ebit was further impacted by costs of approximately million related to the initial documentation and testing requirements of sarbanes oxley section compliance 
these costs are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 

table of contents interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal and fiscal we had lower average debt levels in fiscal  but this was offset by slightly higher interest rates during fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate in fiscal was compared with in fiscal the substantial increase in our effective tax rate is a result of our inability to record tax benefits on losses incurred in certain non us tax jurisdictions  primarily germany and italy  due to uncertainty about whether or not we will be able to generate sufficient future income to utilize these benefits 
if our operations in these countries become profitable  our effective tax rate will decrease as we recognize the benefits of loss carryforwards 
net loss our net loss in fiscal was million compared with net income in fiscal of million 
the overall reduction in net income is a result of the million of restructuring and other charges related to asset dispositions  reduction in selling prices within our pharmaceutical segment  and higher effective tax rate caused by our inability to record tax benefits on losses incurred in certain non us tax jurisdictions 

table of contents fiscal year ended august  compared with fiscal year ended august  net sales sales for the fiscal year ended august  were million compared with million in fiscal foreign currency translation caused an increase in sales of million resulting in a sales decline of million on a constant dollar basis 
the decline in sales is a result of lower sales in our pharmaceutical segment offset by strengthening sales in our energy and industrial segments 
the pharmaceutical segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in the same period of fiscal the impact of exchange rates increased sales by million resulting in a sales decline of million on a constant dollar basis 
the decline in sales volumes is a result of continued weak economic conditions in europe  which represents approximately of this segment s sales volume 
our sales were negatively affected by reduced capital spending by pharmaceutical companies due to general weakness in the capital goods markets in europe and the business consolidations within the pharmaceutical industry 
the consolidation of pharmaceutical companies has resulted in excess capacity as product lines are rationalized among facilities 
the excess capacity as a result of the consolidations is viewed as a short term issue because normal wear and tear on equipment will eventually lead to replacement and the consumption of pharmaceutical products is expected to continue to grow 
the energy segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in the same period of fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the impact of exchange rates increased sales by million resulting in a sales increase of million on a constant dollar basis 
higher oil and natural gas prices and accelerated global demand are being reflected in higher rig count and capital equipment spending in this industry 
the industrial segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
this modest increase in sales is attributed to some improvement in the us industrial economy offset by lower spending for wastewater treatment projects by local municipalities 
earnings before interest and income taxes ebit ebit in fiscal was million compared with million in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded costs of million related to the retirement of our former president and ceo and million for severance costs related to the closure of a reactor systems facility in italy 
the sales volume decline in constant dollars of had a negative impact on ebit of million 
the remaining decline in ebit is a result of price pressures in our pharmaceutical segment million  higher health care costs million and a shift in sales mix as aftermarket sales in our industrial segment were a lower percentage of sales relative to fiscal the pharmaceutical segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decline of million 
the severance costs of million related to the closure of a reactor systems facility in italy were reflected in this segment 
the sales decline of million on a constant dollar basis reduced ebit by million  while price pressures in europe negatively impacted ebit by another million 
these items were partially offset by our efforts to reduce both material and overhead costs in response to the lower sales volumes 
the energy segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the higher sales volumes caused ebit to increase by million 
this was partially offset by new product development costs and costs to establish operations in new markets such as kazakhstan and indonesia 
the industrial segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
the aforementioned million increase in sales volumes only increased ebit by million because of a change in sales mix as the aftermarket business was a smaller percentage of fiscal sales 
in addition  higher health care costs of approximately million negatively impacted ebit in this segment 

table of contents interest expense interest expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this was due to lower average debt levels resulting from cash flow generated in fiscal in addition  fiscal includes the full year interest savings from our interest rate swap instrument  whereas the interest rate swap was only in effect for approximately one quarter of fiscal our effective interest rate was in fiscal and in fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate in fiscal was compared with in fiscal the reduction in fiscal effective tax rate was a result of the utilization of net loss carryforwards that were not previously recognized as assets 
net income net income in fiscal was million compared with million in fiscal the lower net income is a result of the items mentioned above 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources operating activities in fiscal  our cash flow from operations was million compared with million in fiscal cash flow from operations is consistent with fiscal despite the restructuring costs recorded in fiscal  as we were able to generate cash from working capital reductions in fiscal we expect our fiscal operating cash flow to be adequate to fund the fiscal year operating needs  scheduled debt service  shareholder dividend requirements and planned capital expenditures of approximately million 
our planned capital expenditures are related to additional production capacity  cost reductions and replacement items 
investing activities our capital expenditures were million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal the majority of our capital expenditures were for replacement of equipment 
we spent million in fiscal for a new production facility in china 
this facility will be used primarily by our reactor systems group  but will also be utilized to produce other robbins myers  inc products 
the remaining capital expenditures were for additional equipment to increase our capacity and new product development activities of our energy segment  and replacement equipment at our other business units 
as we previously mentioned  during fiscal we sold three facilities and the machinery and inventory related to the lined pipe product line 
the sale of these facilities and product line generated cash proceeds of million 
financing activities we paid million to amend and extend our credit agreement in november and dividends paid during fiscal were million 
proceeds from the sale of common stock were million in fiscal credit agreement our bank credit agreement agreement provides that we may borrow on a revolving credit basis up to a maximum of million 
all outstanding amounts under the agreement are due and payable on october  interest is variable based upon formulas tied to libor or prime  at our option  and is payable at least quarterly 
at august   there were no amounts borrowed under the agreement 
indebtedness under the agreement is unsecured  except for guarantees by our us subsidiaries  the pledge of the stock of our us subsidiaries and the pledge of the stock of certain us subsidiaries 
under this agreement and other lines of credit  we have million of unused borrowing capacity 
however  due to our financial covenants and outstanding standby letters of credit  we could incur additional indebtedness of million 
we have million of standby letters of credit outstanding at august  these standby letters of credit are used as security for advance payments received from customers and future payments to our vendors 
while there were no borrowings under the agreement as of august   the company is actively negotiating an extension or replacement of the current facility to allow for the ability to borrow funds as necessary as well as to be able to continue to issue letters of credit 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time of title passage to our customer 
in instances where we have equipment installation obligations  the revenue related to the installation service is deferred until installation is complete 
we recognize revenue for certain longer term contracts based on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method requires estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method since we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost applicable to various 
table of contents stages of the contract 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that gave rise to the revision become known 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
significant estimates made by us include the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  deferred tax asset valuation allowance  warranty accruals  litigation  product liability  environmental accruals and retirement benefit obligations 
our estimate for uncollectible accounts receivable is based upon an analysis of our prior collection experience  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends within the industries we serve 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us eg  bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
inventory valuation reserves are determined based on our assessment of the market conditions for our products and the on hand quantities of inventory in relation to historical usage 
as of august  we have inventory valuation reserves of million 
the inventory upon which this reserve relates to is still on hand and will be sold or disposed of in the future 
the expected selling price of this inventory approximates its net book value  therefore there is no significant impact on gross margin when it is sold 
we have recorded valuation allowances to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized based upon our analysis of estimated future taxable income and establishment of tax strategies 
future taxable income  reversals of temporary differences  available carryback periods  the results of tax strategies and changes in tax laws could impact these estimates 
warranty obligations are contingent upon product failure rates  material required for the repairs and service delivery costs 
we estimate the warranty accrual based on specific product failures that are known to us plus an additional amount based on the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales 
we record litigation  product liability and environmental reserves based upon a case by case analysis of the facts  circumstances and estimated costs 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare our financial statements 
these estimates are subject to change as conditions within and beyond our control change  including but not limited to economic conditions  the availability of additional information and actual experience rates different from those used in our estimates 
accordingly  actual results may differ from these estimates 
goodwill goodwill is tested on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
impairment tests  which involve the use of estimates related to the fair market values of the business operations with which goodwill is associated  are performed in our first quarter 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the businesses for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over their estimated remaining useful lives 
losses  if any  resulting from impairment tests will be reflected in operating income in our consolidated statement of operations 
foreign currency accounting gains and losses resulting from the settlement of a transaction in a currency different from that used to record the transaction are charged or credited to net income when incurred 
adjustments resulting from the translation of 
table of contents non us financial statements into non us dollars are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss for all non us units 
we use permanently invested intercompany loans as a source of capital to reduce the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our foreign subsidiaries 
these loans are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
therefore  we record foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
pensions we maintain defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans that provide retirement benefits to substantially all us employees and certain non us employees 
pension expense for fiscal and beyond is dependent on a number of factors including returns on plan assets and changes in the plan s discount rate and therefore  cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
the following paragraphs discuss the significant factors that affect the amount of recorded pension expense 
a significant factor in determining the amount of expense recorded for the funded pension plan is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we develop the long term rate of return assumption based on the current mix of equity and debt securities included in the plan s assets and on the historical returns on those types of investments  judgmentally adjusted to reflect current expectations of future returns 
in addition to the expected rate of return on plan assets  recorded pension expense includes the effects of service cost the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period and interest on the plan s liabilities to participants 
these amounts are determined actuarially based on current discount rates and assumptions regarding matters such as future salary increases and mortality 
differences in actual experience in relation to these assumptions are generally not recognized immediately but rather are deferred together with asset related gains or losses 
when cumulative asset related and liability related gains or losses exceed the greater of of total liabilities or the calculated value of plan assets  the excess is amortized and included in pension income or expense 
at august   the discount rate used to value the liabilities of the principal us plan was 
we determine our discount rate based on the moody s aa corporate bond index and an actuarial yield curve applied to the payments we expect to make out of our retirement plans 
additional changes in the key assumptions discussed above would affect the amount of pension expense currently expected to be recorded for years subsequent to specifically  a one half percent decrease in the rate of return on assets assumption would have the effect of increasing pension expense by approximately million 
a comparable increase in this assumption would have the opposite effect 
in addition  a one half percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase expense by approximately million 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
this standard replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all companies to recognize compensation expense for all share based payments  including stock options  at fair value 
we are required to adopt sfas r beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year we are currently evaluating the effect that sfas r will have on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma impact on net income and income per share from calculating stock related compensation costs under the fair value alternative of sfas no 
however  the calculation of compensation cost for share based payment transactions after the effective dated of sfas no 
r may be different from the calculation of compensation cost under sfas no 
 but such differences have not yet been quantified 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain operations in the us and over foreign countries 
we have market risk exposure to foreign exchange rates in the normal course of our business operations 
our significant non us operations have their local currencies as their functional currency and primarily buy and sell using that same currency 
we manage our exposure to net assets and cash flows in currencies other than us dollars by minimizing our us dollar net asset positions 
we also enter into hedging transactions  primarily currency swaps  under established policies and guidelines that enable us to mitigate the potential adverse impact of foreign exchange rate risk 
we do not engage in trading or other speculative activities with these transactions as established policies require that these hedging transactions relate to specific currency exposures 
our main foreign exchange rate exposures relate to assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in british pounds  euros  swiss francs and canadian dollars and the general economic exposure that fluctuations in these currencies could have on the us dollar value of future us cash flows 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on us for fiscal  the net unhedged exposures in each currency were remeasured assuming a decrease in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar 
using this method  our ebit and cash flow from operations for fiscal would have decreased by million and million  respectively 
this calculation assumed that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  these changes may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not include any effects of potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 
we also have market risk exposure to interest rates 
at august   we had million in interest bearing debt obligations subject to market risk exposure due to changes in interest rates 
to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates  we attempt to maintain a balance between fixed and variable rate debt 
we expect this balance in the debt profile to moderate our financing cost over time 
we are limited in our ability to refinance our fixed rate debt 
however  we have the ability to change the characteristics of our fixed rate debt to variable rate debt through interest rate swaps to achieve our objective of balance 
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively modifies a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
this agreement involves the receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without an exchange of underlying principal amounts 
the mark to market values of both the fair value hedging instrument and the underlying debt obligation were equal and recorded as offsetting gains and losses in current period earnings 
the fair value hedge qualifies for treatment under the short cut method of measuring effectiveness 
as a result  there was no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness 
the interest rate swap agreement totals million  expires in and allows us to receive an effective interest rate of and pay an interest rate based on libor 
at august   million of our outstanding debt was at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of and million was at variable rates with a weighted average interest rate of 
the estimated fair value of our debt at august  was approximately million
