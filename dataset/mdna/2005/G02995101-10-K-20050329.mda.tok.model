the environmental business had another year of strong premium growth 
this growth was attributable to the company s strategy of growing this segment 
the company opened an office in denver  colorado in the second quarter of and the cherry hill  new jersey office began its third full year of operations and expanded its underwriting staff as compared to prior years 
the atlanta  georgia office also increased its underwriting staff and expanded its distribution of the prostar online quoting system to qualified brokers prostar was introduced by the company in as part of its strategy to grow this line of business 
while the market has experienced the entrance of new competitors and a general leveling of pricing  the company believes its growth strategy will continue to be effective excess and surplus 
while there have been signs of market conditions softening with less business being shifted out of the standard market to the excess and surplus market  as well as a general leveling of pricing in the market  the company continued to capitalize on current market conditions 
the company s growth strategy allows for increased capacity in this unit  the company intends to diversify its risk portfolio both geographically and by class of business 
the company also intends to maintain its underwriting and pricing discipline in this changing market 
in addition  the company introduced a new excess coverage product in the second quarter of to meet the market need for higher limits of liability above the company s current policies 
programs 
historically  the company has not retained significant portions of risk in this line  however  as it sees opportunities to generate underwriting profits on existing programs  it is prepared to take advantage of those opportunities 
hence  effective in  the company took significant risk on a pest control operators program and in and expanded its risk position in other programs 
based on the opportunities available in the marketplace  the company will continue to look for specialty niche program opportunities where it can take more significant risk positions 
the company had active programs at the end of producing business as compared to at the end of other 
the decrease in other premium earnings is attributable to our exiting specific lines of business that no longer fit in our business model 
during  the company made the decision to only offer renewal policies for workers compensation business  that line will be in full run off starting in the second quarter of in  the company exited the employee leasing and staffing workers compensation line  exited habitational manufacturing commercial lines  and substantially reduced surety writings due to adverse loss experience and the lack of affordable reinsurance 
in  surety net earned premiums and net written premiums increased by approximately  and  respectively  compared to this increase is attributable to the company s recent efforts to modestly expand its surety business as a supporting product line to the environmental segment 
during the second quarter of the company entered into a million per bond quota share reinsurance agreement to facilitate more underwriting opportunities 
in addition  the company s assumed liability program  currently in run off  which had net written premiums of million and million in and respectively  and minimal written premiums in net investment income the increase in net investment income from to is attributable to an increase in the company s invested assets 
average invested assets increased from million to million for  and the pre tax investment yield increased from to  to this increase is consistent with overall market interest rate increases in the latter part of the increase in net investment income from to is similarly attributable to increases in the company s invested assets offset by a decrease in the investment yield 
average invested assets increased from million for to million for  and the pre tax investment yield decreased from to from to this decrease is consistent with overall market interest rate declines in and net realized gains net realized gains decreased in as compared to as a result of the historically low interest rate environment of early  the company chose to realize certain interest sensitive gains on its bond portfolio 
this sale of bonds contributed million to the total net realized gains in real estate income real estate income was million in  million in  and million in this revenue is generated from closings of condominium units and boat slips at our real estate project known as harbour village 
we do not recognize revenue until a closing occurs and title passes to the buyer 
the following chart shows the number of condominium units and boat slips that were closed each year condominium units boat slips total the company had an increase in real estate income in as compared to other years resulting from increased closings of units and higher priced unit closings 
the average sales price of condominiums closed in was  as compared to  in and  in real estate income and sales will be minimal in as most units are sold and closed and the company does not expect to engage in any further real estate activities in the future 
the earnings and funds generated from harbour village are being redeployed into the company s insurance operations as the project is completed 
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio our ratio increased points from to due to a combination of factors 
the excess and surplus segment experienced adverse loss development of million 
of this amount million was attributable to certain new york contractor risks written in exposure to new york contractor risks was significantly reduced during and in response to this development and management s concern that existing reserves for this segment might be inadequate  the company commenced an actuarial reserve evaluation of this segment 
following completion of this evaluation  the company changed actuarial reserving methodologies and recorded million of additional reserves during the third quarter of during  the company experienced adverse loss development of million on its other segment 
of this amount million related to the company s assumed liability program  million related to increases in workers compensation reserves and  related to increases in commercial lines reserves 
all of these three lines of business are currently in run off 
our ratio increased percentage points from to due to a combination of factors 
negative reserve development contributed an additional percentage points to the loss ratio 
that development was primarily associated with adverse loss experience on our workers compensation lines currently in run off 
see discussion under the loss and loss adjustment expense reserve heading in item of this report for further information 
an offsetting factor to such reserve development was the continuing implementation of our growth strategies in our core business lines 
acquisition expenses acquisition expenses are amounts that are paid to agents and brokers for the production of premium for the company offset in part by the ceding commissions we retain from our reinsurers 
for our program business  fees are typically earned through ceding commissions and have the effect of lowering our acquisition expenses 
acquisition expenses also include amounts paid for premium taxes to the states where we do business on an admitted basis 
acquisition expenses were million in  million in  and million in acquisition expenses as a function of net earned premiums were in and were in both and real estate expenses real estate expenses were million in  million in  and million in the majority of real estate expenses  including construction costs  capitalized interest and commissions variable costs are recognized at the same time as revenue is recognized 
general and administrative expenses fixed costs are expensed as incurred 
the following chart shows the components of costs in millions variable fixed total these variable costs  when applied to real estate revenue  produced gross margins of in  in  and in the increase in gross margin was due to higher average sales price on the links units in as compared to units closed in and other expenses other expenses decreased to million in from million in other expenses in include a million recovery related to impaired notes receivable and other expenses in included a million impairment charge 
absent these charges other expenses increased to million from million in  due to additional interest costs  depreciation  audit and travel 
rescission expenses rescission expenses decreased to a benefit of  in from an expense of  in the benefit in includes a million payment received in settlement of professional liability claims in the rescission matter 
also included in are million of additional expenses as a result of adverse court rulings in march operations by geographic segment net income 
net income from bermuda operations increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase is attributable to the company collecting million as final settlement of a note receivable for which an allowance was established in and the reminder of the increase is due to growth in insurance operations 
net income from us operations decreased to million in compared to million in and million in the overall decrease in us operations is primarily resulting from a decrease in insurance operations resulting from adverse loss development off set by an increase in real estate operating results 
assets 
assets from bermuda operations have increased to million at the end of compared to million at the end of and million at the end of this increase is a result of a public stock offering in and an increase in premium writings assumed from growing united states operations 
assets from us operations at the end of were million  compared to million at the end of and million at the end of this change was a result of increased premium writings as the company has capitalized on favorable market conditions off set by a decrease in real estate assets at the end of real estate assets decreased at the end of as the harbour village project nears completion 
equity 
equity of the bermuda operations increased to million at the end of compared to million at the end of and million at the end of this increase is largely due to a public stock offering in which raised approximately million in new equity  higher net income and increased net unrealized gains in the company s investment portfolio offset by a stock repurchase during the third quarter of equity of the us operations was million at the end of  compared to million at the end of and million at the end of this increase was a result of higher net income and increased net unrealized gains in the company s investment portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources the company meets its cash requirements and finances its growth principally through cash flows generated from operations 
since the company has operated in a hardening market with increased insurance premium rates for general liability coverages and increased fees for program business opportunities 
during  the company began to experience a leveling of premium rates due to entrance of new insurance competitors and overall market conditions 
the company s primary sources of short term cash flow are premium writings  investment income and income from real estate development sales 
short term cash requirements relate to claims payments  reinsurance premiums  commissions  salaries  employee benefits  real estate development expenses  and other operating expenses 
due to the uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of settlements of unpaid claims  the company s future liquidity requirements may vary  therefore  the company has structured its investment portfolio maturities to allow for variations in those factors 
the company believes its current cash flows are sufficient for the short term needs of its business and its invested assets are sufficient for the long term needs of our insurance business 
net cash provided from operations was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  during  the company received million in final settlement of previously fully reserved notes receivable and also received million in settlement of professional liability claims against parties who are involved in the principal management rescission litigation 
the company s ability to pay future dividends to shareholders will depend  to a significant degree  on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate earnings from which to pay dividends 
the jurisdictions in which the company and its insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in order to protect the solvency of insurers 
given the company s growth and the capital requirements associated with that growth  the company does not anticipate paying dividends on the common shares in the near future 
we anticipate the completion of harbour village during at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings on a development and construction loan facility 
the estimated completion cost for the remainder of harbour village is approximately million and represents amounts needed to construct a beach club 
management believes that cash on hand will meet the remaining liquidity needs of harbour village 
see exhibit for further information regarding harbour village 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations at the end of were in thousands less than more than total year years years years long term debt  interest   operating leases  total contractual obligations    for these purposes we have excluded routine purchase of services  including insurance  that are expected to be used in the ordinary course of our business 
more information about our contractual obligations is in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the above table includes interest payments through the expirations of interest rate swaps as discussed in note in the financial statements 
at that time the company may redeem the debt or continue with variable interest payments critical accounting estimates the accounting estimates described below are those we consider critical in preparing our financial statements 
these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
investments 
we routinely review our investments that have experienced declines in fair value to determine if the decline is other than temporary 
these reviews are performed with consideration of the facts and circumstances of an issuer in accordance with the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 accounting for non current marketable equity securities  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance 
the identification of distressed investments  and the assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary involve significant management judgment and require evaluation of factors including but not limited to percentage decline in value and the length of time during which the decline has occurred  recoverability of principal and interest  market conditions  ability to hold the investment to maturity  a pattern of continuing operating losses of the issuer  rating agency actions that affect the issuer s credit status  adverse changes in the issuer s availability of production resources  revenue sources  technological conditions  and adverse changes in the issuer s economic  regulatory or political environment 
reserves 
certain of our insurance policies and reinsurance assumed  including general and pollution liability policies covering environmental remediation  excess and surplus  and workers compensation risks  may be subject to claims brought years after an incident has occurred or the policy period has ended 
we are required to maintain reserves to cover the unpaid portion of our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to i reported claims and ii incurred but not reported claims 
a full actuarial analysis is performed to provide this estimate of all unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense obligations of the company under the terms of its contracts and agreements 
in evaluating whether the reserves make a reasonable provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense  it is necessary to project future loss and loss adjustment expense payments 
it is certain that the actual future losses and loss adjustment expenses will not develop exactly as projected and may  in fact  vary significantly from the projections 
if the net reserves were to change by plus this would reduce pre tax income by million 
if the net loss reserves were to change to minus this would increase pre tax income by million 
with respect to reported claims  reserves are established on a case by case basis 
the reserve amounts on each reported claim are determined by taking into account the circumstances surrounding each claim and policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
loss reserves are reviewed on a regular basis  and as new information becomes available  appropriate adjustments are made to reserves 
in establishing reserves  several methods are employed in determining ultimate losses the expected loss ratio method  the bornhuetter ferguson method based on expected loss ratios  paid losses and reported losses  and the loss development method based on paid and reported losses 
the first method uses industry expected losses adjusted for our experience while the last method relies on industry payment and reporting patterns to develop our actual losses 
the bornhuetter ferguson method is a combination of the other two methods  using expected loss ratios to produce expected losses  then applying loss payment and reporting patterns to the expected losses to produce the expected ibnr 
we review the ultimate projections from all three methods and  based on the merits of each method  determine our estimated ultimate losses 
however  the establishment of appropriate loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process  and there can be no assurance that such ultimate payments will not materially exceed our reserves 
deferred income taxes 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance for the portion of any deferred tax asset  that we believe will not be realized 
the majority of our deferred tax assets associated with the harbour village project should be realized in  given current estimates of completion for the project 
the majority of our deferred taxes associated with our premium writings will be realized over the policy period and payout of related claims 
given the historical loss position of american safety rrg  it has established a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
except for the deferred tax assets associated with american safety rrg described above  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the full benefit of our deferred tax assets described herein  therefore no additional valuation allowance has been established 
income taxes we are incorporated under the laws of bermuda and  under current bermuda law  are not obligated to pay any taxes in bermuda based upon income or capital gains 
we have received an undertaking from the minister of finance in bermuda pursuant to the provisions of the exempted undertakings tax protection act  which exempts us and our shareholders  other than shareholders ordinarily resident in bermuda  from any bermuda taxes computed on profits  income or any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate  duty or inheritance until march  exclusive of our us subsidiaries  we do not consider ourselves to be engaged in a trade or business in the us and accordingly do not expect to be subject to direct us income taxation 
our us subsidiaries are subject to taxation in the us impact of inflation property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses are known and therefore before the extent by which inflation may affect such expenses is known 
consequently  we attempt  in establishing our premiums  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation 
however  for competitive and regulatory reasons  we may be limited in raising premiums consistent with anticipated inflation  in which event we  rather than our insureds  would absorb inflation costs 
inflation also affects the rate of investment return on our investment portfolio with a corresponding effect on our investment income 
combined ratio the combined ratio of an insurance company measures only the underwriting results of insurance operations and not the profitability of the overall company 
our reported combined ratio for our insurance operations may not provide an accurate indication of our overall profitability 
for instance  depending on our mix of business  the combined ratio may fluctuate from time to time and may not reflect the overall profitability of our insurance operations

fin 
this interpretation requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the expected residual gains  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of economic losses due to adverse changes in the estimated fair value of a financial instrument as the result of changes in equity prices  interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
our consolidated balance sheets include assets whose estimated fair values are subject to market risk 
the primary market risks to us are interest rate and credit risk associated with our investments in fixed maturity securities 
we have no direct commodity or foreign exchange risk as of december  the estimated fair value of our investment portfolio at december  was million  of which was invested in fixed maturities and short term investments  was invested in real estate and in equities 
interest rate risk 
our fixed maturity holdings are invested predominantly in high quality corporate  government and municipal bonds with relatively short durations 
the fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to interest rate fluctuations  as interest rates rise  their fair values decline and as interest rates fall  their fair values rise 
the changes in the fair market value of the fixed maturity portfolio are presented as a component of shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
we work to manage the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our fixed maturity portfolio 
the effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio is managed with consideration given to the estimated payout timing of our liabilities 
we have investment policies which limit the maximum duration and maturity of individual securities within the portfolio and set target levels for average duration and maturity of the entire portfolio 
the table below summarizes our interest rate risk and shows the effect of hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  the selected hypothetical changes do not indicate what would be the potential best or worst case scenarios dollars in thousands esti mated fair estimated fair hypothetical va lue after hypothetical value at change in interest hyp othetical percentage increase december  rate change in interest decrease in bp basis points rate shareholders equity total fixed maturity  bp decrease investments including bp decrease short term investments bp increase bp increase interest rate risk related to our loans payable to american safety capital trust and american safety capital trust ii  our non consolidated wholly owned subsidiaries  is managed through the use of interest rate swaps 
we have utilized these derivative instruments to effectively hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations for the first five years of the debt obligations 
credit risk 
we invest primarily in the debt securities markets  which exposes us to credit risk 
credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying investment positions 
we require that all securities be rated investment grade at the time of purchase 
we use specific criteria to judge the credit quality and liquidity of our investments and use a variety of credit rating services to monitor these criteria
