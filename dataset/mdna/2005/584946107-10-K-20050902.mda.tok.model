results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  capitalized software costs and goodwill

revenue recognition the company derives revenue from licensing its proprietary applications software and sub licensed software  sale of computer hardware and the services performed related to the installation  training  consultation and ongoing support of the software 
license fee revenue is generally recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
revenue from the sale of hardware is generally recognized upon shipment 
fees for installation  training and consultation are recognized as the services are provided 
if the company enters into arrangements with a client requiring significant customization of the software or services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the company recognizes revenue derived from the sale of licensed software  sub licensed software and services over the period the services are performed  in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop no 
 sop and clarified by staff accounting bulletin sab  sab no

factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  seeks  expects  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance or future results and involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made herein and presented elsewhere from time to time 
other unforeseen factors not identified herein could also have such an effect 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements 
key personnel to remain competitive  the company must attract  motivate and retain highly skilled managerial  sales  marketing  consulting and technical personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
the company s failure to attract qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company s current chief executive officer has announced his resignation effective october as of the date hereof  the company has not replaced the chief executive officer 
if the company does not find a suitable replacement for the chief executive officer  the company s performance could be adversely affected 
additionally  if the new chief executive officer  when selected  is unable to lead the company as expected or is unable to retain the company s other key management personnel  the company s results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results mediware s revenue and results of operations can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter 
system sales in any quarter depend substantially upon mediware s sales performance and customers budgeting and buying practices 
system sales in any quarter may fluctuate due to contract activity  demand for the company s products and services  lengthy and complex sales cycles  and the customers internal budgets for new technology systems and technical resources to deploy them 
additionally  the terms of a final contract may materially affect the company s ability to recognize anticipated quarterly revenue 
factors that impact contract terms and quarterly revenue include the following systems contracts may include both currently deliverable and non deliverable software products 
customer needs for services that include significant modifications  customization or complex interfaces that could delay product delivery or acceptance 
customer specific acceptance criteria 
payment terms that are long term or depend upon contingencies 
reliance on third party software mediware licenses various third party software products that it incorporates into its own software products 
these products may include operating systems  relational database management systems  knowledge clinical databases and other key systems 
the termination by any third party vendor of mediware s licenses to use these products  or a significant change to a relied upon product  could have a material adverse effect on mediware s operations 
changes that could have a material adverse effect include  for example  the third party products becoming inoperable  features and functions becoming unavailable  product performance being materially reduced  or unfavorable pricing changes 
although alternate software products may be available  mediware could incur substantial costs if it is required to adapt its products to alternative third party software products 
dependence on third party marketing relationships mediware s continued growth could be impacted by its ability to build and maintain strong marketing partnerships 
the company believes its marketing and sales efforts can be significantly enhanced by these relationships 
if mediware is not able to enhance its current relationships or develop new relationships  the company could experience a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations or financial condition 
changes in the healthcare industry the healthcare industry is heavily regulated by various governmental and regulatory bodies 
the decisions made and initiatives promulgated by these bodies may significantly influence operations of hospitals and healthcare organizations and could have a material adverse effect on mediware s business  results of operations or financial condition 
many hospitals are consolidating and forming or becoming part of integrated healthcare delivery networks ihdns 
additionally  hospitals have the option to select a single vendor  enterprise wide solution that automates all functions of the hospital  called a hospital information support system hiss 
the formation of ihdns and hiss oriented purchasing might reduce the number of discrete prospects the company may target on a best of breed basis and could provide more negotiating leverage to the company s prospective customers 
these events  if they occurred  could result in a reduction of selling prices  an increase in the length of the sales cycle  or other situations that could negatively affect the company 
significant competition the market for healthcare information systems is extremely competitive 
some of the company s competitors are siemens ag  mckesson corporation  eclypsis corporation  misys plc  global med technologies  inc  scc soft computer  cerner corporation and ge healthcare  each of which offer products that compete with certain offerings of the company 
many of the company s competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  sales and marketing resources 
a number of factors determine success or failure in this market  including the functionality of the software  the quality of client references  the underlying technical architecture  the financial stability of the software provider  the ongoing support of the system  and the quality and quantity of the sales organization 
the company s ability to maintain a positive stance in all of the above areas will affect its ability to compete successfully 
product acceptance mediware s strategy in all three of its operating divisions includes licensing of new products to customers  which requires customer acceptance of its newly developed and released products 
while the company believes that each of its new products is positioned to succeed in the market place  there is no assurance that customers will accept or adopt the products to the extent that the company expects 
if mediware customers do not accept the new products as expected  mediware s results could be materially and adversely affected 
new technologies there is a risk that technology not currently in the mainstream will quickly enter the market and disrupt mediware s existing business and mediware s customers need for its products 
mediware is working diligently to be innovative and to ensure that its products remain state of the art  but new technologies in the marketplace could adversely affect mediware 
new product development the company s strategy relies on the continuing development of new software products 
mediware currently intends to continue investing in research and development and new products 
while mediware expects that this investment will produce advantages and new products and markets  there can be no assurance that advantages and new products of the research and development will be realized 
in addition  development of new products is a complex and difficult process 
as a result  mediware  like other software companies  may encounter difficulties or delays in the development  implementation and market acceptance of new products 
government regulation the hospitals that comprise the primary market for the company s products must comply with various federal  state and local statutes and regulations 
the adequacy of blood bank information management and record keeping products are subject to regulation  inspection and review by the fda 
the company s blood bank products are regulated as medical devices by the fda 
blood bank software vendors are also subject to the fda s quality systems regulations qsr 
although mediware is continually updating and improving its internal quality system to ensure compliance with federal rules and guidelines  mediware cannot predict whether it will be fully in compliance with these guidelines or any future guidelines  regulations or inspection procedures 
non compliance with any such guidelines  regulations or procedures could have a material adverse effect on the operations of clinical information system vendors of blood bank information systems  including mediware 
the fda modernization act of was enacted on november  and became effective on february  under this legislation  the fda is directed to consider the extent to which reliance on post market controls could expedite the pre market notification review process and the classification of devices 
the legislation also requires the fda to ensure that good manufacturing practices conform  to the extent practicable  to internationally recognized standards for medical devices 
neither of these provisions appears on its face to contemplate regulation which would have a material adverse effect on the company s blood bank information system operations  however  the legislation expanded the jurisdiction of the fda and the company remains unable to predict the effect of any resulting applicable future regulation 
if any of the company s existing products or future products become subject to congressional or governmental agency efforts to establish or expand governmental agency jurisdiction  compliance would likely be costly and time consuming 
however  the company believes it could have a competitive advantage if the fda regulations apply to cord blood stem cells  tissue or other biologic products 
in fiscal  the company received its initial hcll k product clearance from the fda 
this clearance opened the way for the company to begin marketing hcll 
all fda regulated products are required to obtain additional k clearance as new functionality is added 
two additional k clearances for hcll were received during fiscal for additional production functionality 
in may  the company received its most recent k clearance for it hcll donor management system 
the company has dedicated substantial time and resources to comply with applicable guidelines and regulations 
the fda enforces compliance by such actions as recalls  seizures  injunctions  civil fines and criminal prosecutions 
unsatisfactory compliance and the inability to timely remedy any non compliance  resulting in any of the above actions  would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
new regulations relating to patient confidentiality the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa mandates significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment governing the provision of health benefits  the delivery of and payment for healthcare services  and the security and confidentiality of individually identifiable  protected health information in written  electronic or oral formats 
the department of health and human services has adopted final rules implementing hipaa 
the final rules include standards for the security of electronic health information and the privacy of a patient s medical records and became effective on february  and april   respectively 
most healthcare providers  healthcare clearinghouses and health plans covered entities are required to comply 
covered entities were also required to comply with the standards for security by april  and have been required to comply with the standards for privacy since april  although the company is not a covered entity  most of the company s customers are covered entities 
as covered entities  the company s customers are required to flow down certain of their obligations under hipaa to their service providers 
accordingly  the company has been required to adopt different and or additional procedures 
in addition  the company has had increased legal expenses associated with negotiating agreements with existing and new customers to implement the new hipaa obligations 
in light of the new obligations under hipaa  covered entities may be required or may choose to reevaluate their technology solutions 
the company may be required to invest in its products and procedures to maintain compliance and the company is subject to contractual requirements arising from hipaa that increase the company s liability and risks associated with the handling of individual protected health information 
in addition  many states have passed or are evaluating local versions of hipaa 
product related liabilities all of the company s products provide data for use by healthcare providers in patient care settings 
mediware s license agreements generally contain provisions to limit exposure to product related claims 
these provisions  however  may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions or may not adequately limit the company s exposure 
the company maintains product liability insurance at an amount it believes adequate for its intended purpose  however  there can be no assurances that the insurance will cover a claim brought against the company 
although no claims have been brought against the company to date for injuries related to the use of its products  there is a risk that such claims could be pursued 
a successful claim brought against the company  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
system errors and warranties despite testing by mediware  software products as complex as those offered by the company and used in a wide range of clinical and health information systems settings contain a number of errors or bugs  especially early in their product life cycle 
the company s products are clinical information systems used in patient care settings where a low tolerance for bugs exists 
testing of products is difficult due to the wide range of environments in which the systems are installed 
due to these factors  the discovery of defects or errors could cause delays in product delivery  poor client references  payment disputes  contract cancellations  or additional expenses and payments to rectify problems 
any of these factors may delay acceptance of products  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
limited protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights  proprietary technology may be subjected to infringement claims 
the company relies upon a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  license and marketing agreements  and nondisclosure agreements to protect its proprietary information 
generally  the company has not historically filed patent applications or copyrights covering its software technology 
as a result  the company may not be able to protect against the misappropriation of its intellectual property 
the company does not believe its software products or the third party software products the company offers under sublicense agreements  company trademarks or other company proprietary rights infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
however  there can be no assurance that third parties  including creators of open source code  will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future with respect to current or future software products or that any such assertion may not require the company to modify its products  enter into royalty arrangements  payout damage awards or result in costly litigation 
fluctuations in stock price the trading price of the company s common stock may fluctuate significantly from time to time 
generally  the company s common stock has relatively low trading volume which can cause transactions in a relatively small number of shares to significantly impact the price of the stock 
other factors that can cause the company s common stock price to fluctuate include  but are not limited to quarterly variations in operating results  changes in expectations or estimates of securities analysts  action by governmental or regulatory bodies  the exercising of a large number of options  and changes in the securities markets in general 
item a
