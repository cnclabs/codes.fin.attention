restatement of financial statements in connection with our preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   management of the company determined that the previously issued financial statements contained in our annual report on form k a for the year ended december  and the quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended march   june  and september  should be restated to correct errors in those financial statements 
the decision to restate these financial statements was made after management s discovery of the following errors included in our income taxes payable balance at december  was a tax contingency reserve of million 
this reserve had been specifically established for certain tax deductions that were included in the deferred tax asset balance at that date 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
the establishment of this full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is described in note  income taxes  to these consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the tax contingency reserve  which was established for the probable disallowance of certain tax deductions  should have been classified as a reduction of the related deferred tax assets and not as a separate liability at december  as a result  the valuation allowance that was recorded in that year should be reduced by million  estimated state income tax liabilities of million had not been accrued in the year ended december  this error was not detected in the review process for our tax provision  during the quarter ended june   we vacated a facility in san francisco  california and should have recognized additional non cash restructuring charges related to abandoned property and equipment 
as a result  we recognized additional non cash impairment charges of million for the quarter ended june  to reduce impaired property and equipment assets  and reduced depreciation expense by  and  for the quarters ended september  and december   respectively  and effective january   we corrected our classification of revenue from our subsidiary  second street securities  when they engage in soft dollaring of third party products or services 
under such arrangements  second street securities returns a portion of its commission revenues received from its customers in the form of third party products or services 
as a result  revenues and cost of revenues for the three quarterly periods ending march  june and september  have been restated to reflect revenue recognition on a net basis from these transactions as we are not the primary obligor 
this change does not affect gross margin  operating loss  or net loss for any periods presented 
we have not changed revenues and cost of revenues in periods prior to fiscal as the amounts were not material 

table of contents 
index to financial statements these corrections had no significant impact on our financial statements in periods prior to the quarter ended december  see note  restatement of financial statements  for a summary of the effect of these changes on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and on our consolidated statement of operations  consolidated statement of stockholders equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  overview we offer integrated software solutions for automating and integrating data and work flows across the investment management organization  as well as the information flows between the investment management organization and external parties 
our products are intended to increase operational efficiency  improve the accuracy of client information and enable better decision making 
each solution focuses on specific mission critical functions of the investment management organization and is tailored to meet the needs of the particular client  as determined by size  assets under management and complexity of the investment environment 
fiscal was characterized by improved operating results 
revenues increased over the prior year after two years of declining revenues 
we generated million in operating cash flow in  up from million in our operating losses declined to million in from million in during  we introduced upgrades on all our major products including new versions of geneva  axys  moxy and partner 
we also launched a new product  open sma manager  which serves some unique needs in a key area of our market  separately managed accounts 
we added new clients during fiscal  including reaching the client milestone for our geneva product  which was offset by the loss of approximately clients 
we continued our restructuring initiatives which we began in  and we recorded total restructuring charges of million during fiscal we exited facilities in san francisco  california and cambridge  massachusetts  and continued to streamline our operations  reducing headcount from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal as a result  our total cost of revenues and operating expenses decreased to million in from million in in the second quarter of  we purchased the remaining independent distributor businesses of advent europe holding bv advent europe in the united kingdom and switzerland and certain assets of advent europe 
we now control all of our european operations 
over the last year  we have added customers in the europe  middle east and africa emea regions and view this as an increasingly important market for us in the future 
our challenge will be to successfully integrate the new european entities and continue growth in those markets 
our international sales  which are based on the location to which the product is shipped  have increased to of our net revenues in  from in and in during  we began a transition from selling mostly perpetual software licenses to a mix of perpetual and term licenses 
we believe that moving to a term license model will increase the value over the long term of each customer relationship and improve the predictability of our revenues 
including our entry level product  advent office essentials  we recognized approximately of license revenue from term licenses in if we are successful in our strategy to increase term licenses  it will result in a greater portion of license revenue being deferred and could therefore impact the level and timing of our profitability 
looking forward  we continue to focus on returning to profitability 
while recent economic trends have been positive and our customers have been more willing to commit to new software purchases  our ability to achieve profitability will depend upon our ability to introduce new products  license software and sell services to new and existing customers and to renew maintenance contracts at similar levels to those we achieved during fiscal our cost structure  excluding the impact of our acquisitions of the remaining distributor businesses of advent europe in the united kingdom and switzerland  must remain approximately flat with current levels of expenditure or decrease in order to reach profitability 

table of contents 
index to financial statements while worldwide demand for large investment management software systems has stabilized over the past year  we expect a continued challenging business environment and limited visibility in fiscal we will continue our focus on aggressively managing costs and expect continued positive cash flow from operations 
we will also continue to invest in areas we deem appropriate  such as the recent expansion of our european operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relates to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our process used to develop estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from software licenses  development fees  maintenance  other recurring revenues  professional services and other revenues 
in addition  we earn commissions from customers who use our broker dealer  second street securities  to soft dollar the purchase of non advent products and services 
soft dollaring enables the customers to use the commissions earned on trades to pay all or part of the fees owed to us for non advent products or services  which are initially paid for by second street securities 
the commission revenues earned from soft dollaring non advent products or services are recorded as other revenues in professional services and other revenues in our consolidated statements of operations 
we offer a wide variety of products and services to a large number of financially sophisticated customers 
while many of our lower priced license transactions  maintenance contracts  subscription based transactions and professional services projects conform to a standard structure  many of our larger transactions are complex and may require significant review and judgment in our application of generally accepted accounting principles 
software license and development fees 
we recognize revenue from the licensing of software when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we generally use a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding order forms and signed contracts from the distributor s customers 
revenue is recognized upon shipment to the distributor s customer and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
delivery occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier fob shipping point 
while many of our arrangements generally do not include acceptance provisions  certain complex deals may involve acceptance criteria 
if acceptance provisions are provided  delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we assess whether the collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured based on a number of factors  including the credit worthiness of the customer determined through review of credit reports  our transaction history with the customer  other available information and pertinent country risk if the customer is located outside the united states 
our standard payment terms are due on receipt  however  terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed 
software licenses are sold with maintenance and  frequently  professional services 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we allocate revenue to delivered components  normally the license component of the arrangement  using the residual method  based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of the undelivered elements generally the maintenance and professional services components  which is specific to us 
we determine the fair value of the undelivered elements based on the historical evidence of the company s stand alone sales of these elements to third parties 
when vsoe does not exist for undelivered elements  then the entire arrangement fee is deferred until delivery of the element 
we offer term licenses as an alternative to perpetual licenses and generally recognize revenue for term licenses ratably over the period of the contract term 
we have begun a transition from selling mostly perpetual licenses to selling a mix of term and perpetual contracts  and we expect term license revenue to increase as a proportion of total license revenue in the future 
including our entry level product  advent office essentials  we recognized approximately of license revenue from term licenses in development fees are derived from contracts that we have entered into with other companies  including customers and development partners 
agreements for which we receive development fees generally provide for the development of technologies and products that are expected to become part of our general product offerings in the future 
revenues for license development projects are recognized primarily using the percentage of completion method of accounting  based on costs incurred to date compared with the estimated cost of completion  or using the completed contract method  when the development project is finished 
if a customer buys our software and chooses to enter into a soft dollar arrangement through our in house broker dealer subsidiary  second street securities  the soft dollar arrangement does not change or modify the original fixed or determinable fee in the written contract 
the customer is required to pay the original fee for our software within one year 
if insufficient trading volume is generated to pay the entire original fee within one year  the customer is still required to render payment within one year 
if the customer chooses to use a third party broker dealer  the original payment terms apply  regardless of the arrangement with the third party broker dealer 
the option to soft dollar a transaction does not alter the underlying revenue recognition for the transaction  all the revenue recognition criteria listed in the software license section above must be assessed in determining how the revenue will be recognized 
our standard practice is to enforce our contract terms and not allow our customers to return software 
we have  however  allowed customers to return software on a limited case by case basis and have recorded sales returns reserves as offsets to revenue in the period the sales return becomes probable  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns and other related factors 
we do have three situations where we provide a contractual limited right of return to end user customers only in shrink wrap license agreements for advent products  our microedge product and our npo product 
the shrink wrap license agreement for advent products provides for a right of return within seven days of delivery of the software 
the microedge software license agreement allows for a thirty day money back guarantee 
the npo license agreement allows for a seven day right of return 
we recognize revenue on delivery since the fee is fixed or determinable  the buyer is obligated to pay  the risk of loss passes to the customer  and we have the ability to estimate returns 
our ability to estimate returns is based on a long history of experience with relatively homogenous transactions and the fact that the return period is short 
we have recorded a sales returns reserve contra revenue account to account for these situations based on our historical experience of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
maintenance and other recurring revenues 
we offer annual maintenance programs that provide for technical support and updates to our software products 
maintenance fees are bundled in the initial licensing year and charged separately for renewals of annual maintenance in subsequent years 
we offer other recurring revenue services that are either subscription based or transaction based  and primarily include the provision of software interfaces to  and the capability to download securities information from  third party data providers 
fair value for maintenance is based upon renewal rates stated in the contracts or  in limited cases  separate sales of renewals to other customers 
we recognize revenue for maintenance ratably over the contract term 
we recognize revenue from recurring revenue transactions either ratably over the subscription period or as the transactions occur 

table of contents 
index to financial statements subscription based revenues and any related set up fees are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
professional services and other revenues 
we offer a variety of professional services that include project management  implementation  data conversion  integration  custom report writing and training 
fair value for professional services is based upon separate sales of these services by us to other customers 
our professional services are generally billed based on hourly rates together with reimbursement for travel and accommodation expenses 
our professional services and other revenue also include revenue from our annual user conference 
we generally recognize revenue as these professional services are performed 
certain professional services arrangements involve acceptance criteria 
in these cases  revenue and related expenses are recognized upon acceptance 
effective january   commission revenues received from soft dollar transactions for products and services not related to advent products and services are recorded as other revenues on a net basis as we are not the primary obligor in these transactions 
revenues for these soft dollar transactions are recognized on a trade date basis as securities transactions occur 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
generally accepted accounting principles require us to evaluate whether or not we will realize a benefit from net deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
significant factors considered by management in assessing the need for a valuation allowance include the following our historical operating results  the length of time over which the differences will be realized  tax planning opportunities  and expectations for future earnings 
in considering whether or not we will realize a benefit from net deferred tax assets  recent losses must be given substantially more weight than any projections of future profitability 
in  we determined that  under applicable accounting principles  based on our history of consecutive losses since the second quarter of  it was more likely than not that we would not realize any value for our net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance equal to of the amount of these assets 
in  we continued to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to our continued losses 
income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent sufficient positive evidence materializes to support a reversal of  or decrease in  the valuation allowance 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter as of november of our fiscal year and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss has occurred 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we have determined that we have five reporting units as of november  the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its respective carrying amount  goodwill of our reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill with the respective carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires judgment at many points during the test including future revenue forecasts  discount rates and various reporting unit allocations 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual impairment test which did not indicate impairment 
therefore  the second step of the impairment test was not necessary to perform 
we review our other long lived assets including property and equipment and other intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative market or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
for example  demand for our techfi product line was significantly lower than expected and thus we discontinued certain products within our techfi product line in september as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in the third quarter of to write off the carrying value of certain techfi related intangible assets 
we hold minority interests in several privately held companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus 
most of these investments can be considered as early stage investment opportunities and are classified as other assets and valued at the lower of cost or fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 
through december   one of these investments had been accounted for under the equity method of accounting as our chief executive officer was a member of the investee s board of directors 
effective december   our chief executive officer resigned her seat on this investee s board of directors and as a result  we no longer believe we have significant influence over this investee 
therefore  this investment is carried at the lower of cost or fair value at december   similar to our other investments 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we estimate an investment s carrying value using a variety of valuation methodologies 
such methodologies include comparing the private company with publicly traded companies in similar lines of business  applying revenue multiples to estimated future operating results for the private company and estimating discounted cash flows for that company 
restructuring expenses and related accruals 
during and  we developed and implemented formalized plans for restructuring our business to better align our resources to market conditions and recorded significant charges 
in connection with these plans  we recorded estimated expenses for severance and benefits  lease cancellations  asset write offs and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy 
table of contents 
index to financial statements periods and sub lease rents 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
acquisitions on may   we acquired the remaining independent distributor businesses from our independent european distributor  advent europe  in the united kingdom and switzerland  as well as certain assets of advent europe 
we made these acquisitions in order to gain direct control over all of our european operations  which we view as an increasingly important market 
the consideration of million consisted of million in cash   of assumed liabilities and  of closing costs 
a total of million of the cash consideration was paid at closing and the remaining million was retained by the company as security for possible breach of general representations and warranties 
we will pay this amount to advent europe approximately one year after the closing date in the event no such breach of general representations or warranties exists 
in addition  we paid an earn out distribution of approximately million under a formula based on revenue bookings  which was recorded as additional goodwill in the second quarter of no further earn out distributions were earned or paid 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired on the basis of their respective fair values on the acquisition date 
the amounts allocated to identifiable intangibles were determined based upon management s estimates using established valuation techniques 
the results of operations of advent united kingdom and advent switzerland are included in the consolidated statement of operations subsequent to the date of acquisition

common stock repurchases in may  the board of directors approved a plan to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock in the open market 
in september  the board authorized an extension of this stock repurchase program to cover the repurchase of an additional million shares of outstanding common stock 
through december   we have repurchased and retired  shares of common stock since inception of this stock repurchase program at a total cost of million 
on february   our board of directors approved an extension of this stock repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to an additional million shares of common stock

through may when this program was terminated  we had repurchased and retired million shares of common stock since inception of this program at a total cost of million 
employee stock option exchange program in november  we commenced a voluntary stock option exchange program made available to certain eligible employees of the company 
the chairman of the board  chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief technology officer and executive vice president of corporate development were specifically excluded from participating in the exchange program 
under this program  eligible employees were given the option to cancel each outstanding stock option granted to them at an exercise price greater than or equal to per share  in exchange for a new option to buy shares of the company s common stock to be granted on june   six months and one day from december   the expiration date of the offer  and the date the old options of the participating employees were cancelled 
additionally  options granted in the six months prior to this exchange offer  irrespective of their exercise prices  were cancelled for all employees who elected to participate in the exchange program 
there was no credit given for option vesting during the period between cancellation of the outstanding option and the grant of the new option 
the exercise price of the new options is  equal to the fair market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
in total   option shares were eligible to participate in this program and  options were surrendered for cancellation ranging in exercise price from to with a weighted average exercise price of per share 
the exchange program did not result in additional compensation charges 
reclassifications certain prior period amounts  as detailed below  have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation to better reflect our view of the current business 
these reclassifications do not affect total net revenues  net loss  or stockholders equity 
accounts receivable and deferred revenues 
in the first quarter of  we discontinued netting down specific revenue reserves which were included in deferred revenues against their corresponding receivables 
we have determined that for presentation purposes  the discontinuation of the net down for the reserves gives more visibility to our receivables and deferred revenue accounts 
we have reclassified million for the year ended 
table of contents 
index to financial statements december  resulting in corresponding increases in both accounts receivable and deferred revenue and have made corresponding reclassifications on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
in addition to discontinuing the specific reserve net down noted above in the first quarter of  we also changed our methodology for recording accounts receivable and deferred revenues in the second quarter of in prior periods  we netted down amounts in deferred revenue that were still outstanding as a receivable 
beginning on april  accounts receivable and deferred revenues except for future maintenance and contract deliverables not yet earned are shown gross instead of net  as no offset entry is made 
there is no impact on the consolidated statements of operations or cash flows 
supplemental comparative disclosures  as if the change had been retroactively applied  are presented below in thousands december accounts receivable  net deferred revenues auction rate securities 
certain auction rate securities have been reclassified from cash equivalents to short term marketable securities 
auction rate securities are variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates with maturities on the face of the securities in excess of days 
auction rate securities have interest rate resets through a modified dutch auction  at predetermined short term intervals  usually  or days 
they trade at par and are callable at par on any interest payment date at the option of the issuer 
interest paid during a given period is based upon the interest rate determined during the prior auction 
although these securities are issued and rated as long term bonds  they are priced and traded as short term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the interest rate reset 
we had historically classified these instruments as cash equivalents if the period between interest rate resets was days or less  which was based on our ability to either liquidate our holding or roll our investment over to the next reset period 
based upon our re evaluation of the maturity dates associated with the underlying bonds  we have reclassified our auction rate securities  previously classified as cash equivalents  as short term marketable securities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  in addition  purchases of marketable securities and sales and maturities of marketable securities  included on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows  have been revised to reflect the purchase and sale of auction rate securities during the periods presented 
as of december   the company held approximately million of these auction rate securities  which were reclassified 
these reclassifications had no impact on the results of operations of the company

license revenues are derived from the licensing of software products  while development fees are derived from development contracts that we have entered into with other companies  including customers and development partners 
maintenance and other recurring revenues are derived from maintenance fees charged in the initial licensing year  renewals of annual maintenance services in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements subsequent years and recurring revenues derived from our subscription based and transaction based services 
professional services and other revenues include fees for consulting  training services  soft dollaring of third party products and services and our user conferences 
net revenues increased in due to growing information technology spending by our customers  as well as a general increase in demand for many of our products and services 
the increase reflected improving economic conditions and growth in the financial markets 
the growth in net revenues included increases in license and development fees  maintenance and recurring revenues  as well as increased revenue from international sales 
the decline in net revenues in reflected adverse economic conditions  and reduced spending by some of our customers  particularly by certain customers with whom we were developing strategic relationships and who had made large purchases in in  license and development fees  and professional services revenues declined significantly as compared to  partially offset by an increase in maintenance and other recurring revenues 
the adverse economic conditions that negatively impacted revenues across the industry in and stabilized in  resulting in shorter sales cycles  growing investment in information technology projects  and a general increase in expenditures for software related services 
going forward  we expect normal seasonal weakness to impact revenues in the first quarter of  followed by modest growth as the year progresses 
however  we also expect a continued challenging business environment and limited ability to forecast revenue over the near term  particularly with respect to license revenue  as we shift from selling mostly perpetual licenses to selling a mix of term and perpetual licenses 
international sales  which are based on the location to which the product is shipped  also contributed to our growth in  representing of our net revenues in  compared to in and in we expect growth to continue in fiscal  especially in the emea region 
the revenues from customers in any single international country did not exceed of total revenues 
each of the major revenue categories has historically varied as a percentage of net revenues and we expect this variability to continue in future periods 
this variability is partially due to the timing of the introduction of new products  the relative size and timing of individual licenses  as well as the size of the implementation  the resulting proportion of the maintenance and professional services components of these license transactions and the amount of client use of pricing and related data 
license and development fees in thousands  except percentages license and development fees percent of net revenues change over prior year percent change over prior year the increase in license and development fees revenue in primarily reflected the improving economic and industry conditions resulting in increased capital spending by our customers 
the increase was primarily due to higher license fees of an aggregate million from sales of axys  partner  moxy  qube  geneva and other associated products  particularly with larger customers 
improving financial markets in resulted in a more favorable business climate as our customers were more willing to commit to new software purchases 
the decline in reflected adverse economic conditions and economic uncertainty 
the decrease in license and development fees revenue in was due primarily to lower license fees from certain strategic relationships of million and also to decreased sales of geneva and the advent office suite of products of million  and reflected a decline in both size and volume of our software sales 
the reluctance of some of our customers to commit to new software purchases also resulted in the significant decline in license and development fees revenue as a percentage of net revenues in for each of the periods presented  the advent office suite of products  including axys  moxy  partner and qube  accounted for the majority of license revenue  with geneva sales as the other major contributor

the technology spending patterns of organizations in microedge s primary markets independent foundations  community foundations and corporations are directly affected by economic fluctuations as foundation budgets are largely driven by endowment income 
given that endowments often contain market exposed components  they are significantly affected by the economy 
for instance  foundation spending decreases in an economic downturn 
community foundations are subject to similar influences  compounded by the fact that in many cases much of their ongoing funding and endowment comes from active donors who may increase or reduce their giving depending on the economic climate and the related effect on their income and wealth 
corporations typically fund charitable activities from operating budgets  and the allocation to charitable donations and supporting company charitable operations is often closely tied to a company s performance 
thus  corporate philanthropy and spending on related technology are correlated with company and overall economic performance 
the increase in microedge revenue in fiscal also reflected the improved economic conditions and growth in the financial markets which resulted in increased charitable contributions 
this increase in charitable contributions received by the foundations sector in enabled foundations to increase their information technology expenditures which resulted in the increase in microedge revenue in the decrease in microedge revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the economic recession and events on

the primary purpose of sab is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  which was superceded as a result of the issuance of emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
sab also incorporated certain sections of the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers document 
while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

index to financial statements risk factors investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
these risks are not the only ones we face 
additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business could be harmed by any of these risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks 
in assessing these risks  investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
our software products are sold primarily on a perpetual license model 
individual software licenses vary significantly in value  and the value and timing of these transactions can therefore cause our quarterly license revenues to fluctuate 
we have often recognized a substantial portion of each quarter s license revenues in the last month  weeks or even days of the quarter 
as a result  the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations in license revenue may not be evident until late in or after the close of a particular quarter and a disruption late in the quarter may have a disproportionately large negative impact on revenue 
in addition  some of our large professional services contracts contain performance milestones or acceptance clauses  which affect the timing of revenue recognized under such contracts 
as a result of both these factors  our quarterly net revenues have fluctuated significantly 
our expense levels are based in significant part on our expectations of future revenues and therefore are relatively fixed in the short term 
due to the fixed nature of these expenses  combined with the relatively high gross margin historically achieved on our products  an unanticipated decline in net revenues in any particular quarter may adversely affect our operating results 
these factors have impacted and may continue to impact our results 
we have begun a transition from selling mostly perpetual licenses to selling a mix of perpetual and multi year term licenses  and we expect term license revenue to increase as a proportion of total license revenue in the future 
we recognize revenue for term licenses ratably over the period of the contract term  which is typically three to five years 
including our entry level product  advent office essentials  we recognized approximately of license revenue from term licenses in if we are successful in our strategy to increase the proportion of our business signed on term license contracts  it will result in a greater portion of license revenue being deferred and could therefore impact the level and timing of our profitability 
however  over the long term the increases in deferred license revenue and backlog  which we define as the value of multi year term license contracts not included in deferred revenue  will lower the quarterly variability of license revenues 
in addition  we experience seasonality in our license revenue 
the fourth quarter of the year typically has the highest license revenue  followed by lower license revenue in the first quarter of the succeeding year 
we believe that this seasonality results primarily from customer budgeting cycles and expect this seasonality to continue in the future  although if we are successful in moving more of our licenses to a term model  the impact of this seasonality will likely decrease 
because of the above factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
our sales cycle is long and we have limited ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales 
the purchase of our software products often requires prospective customers to provide significant executive level sponsorship and to make major systems architecture decisions 
as a result  we must generally engage in a relatively lengthy sales and contracting effort 
sales transactions may therefore be delayed during the customer decision process because we must provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefit of our products 
this has been exacerbated by the adverse and uncertain economic 
table of contents 
index to financial statements conditions that have caused existing and potential clients to reduce or cancel expenditures and delay decisions related to acquisition of software and related services 
while we have seen somewhat improved economic conditions recently  customers are still very cautious about capital and information technology expenditures 
as a result  the sales cycle associated with the purchase of our solutions is typically between two and twelve months depending upon the size of the client  and is subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control  including customers budgeting constraints  internal selection procedures  and changes in customer personnel  among others 
as a result of a lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle  we have limited ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific license sales 
the timing of large individual license sales is especially difficult to forecast  and we may not be successful in closing large license transactions on a timely basis or at all 
in addition  customers may postpone their purchases of our existing products or product enhancements in advance of the anticipated introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors 
because our expenses are relatively fixed in the near term  any shortfall from anticipated revenues could result in a significant variation in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
we depend heavily on our product  axys 
historically  we have derived a significant portion of our net revenues from the licensing of axys  and related ancillary products and services 
in addition  many of our other applications  such as partner  moxy  qube and various data interfaces were designed to operate with axys to provide an integrated solution 
as a result  we believe that for the foreseeable future a majority of our net revenues will depend upon continued market acceptance of axys  enhancements or upgrades to axys and related products and services 
as our clients include a range of organizations  including asset managers  investment advisors  brokerage firms  banks  family offices  hedge funds and others  the degree of continued market acceptance also will depend on the number of firms within each type of organization and the degree to which axys previously penetrated those firms 
we depend upon financial markets 
the target clients for our products include a range of financial services organizations that manage investment portfolios  including asset managers  investment advisors  brokerage firms  banks  family offices  hedge funds and others 
in addition  we target corporations  public funds  universities and non profit organizations  which also manage investment portfolios and have many of the same needs 
the success of many of our clients is intrinsically linked to the health of the financial markets 
we believe that demand for our solutions has been  and could continue to be  disproportionately affected by fluctuations  disruptions  instability or downturns in the financial services industry which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay  cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for investment management systems and software products 
also  recent investigative efforts into various mutual fund and other financial industry practices could impact our business if the industry experiences a decline in business 
in addition  a slowdown in the formation of new investment firms or a decline in the growth of assets under management would cause a decline in demand for our solutions 
we believe that the downturn in the financial services industry and the decline in information technology spending continued to negatively impact the demand for our products in the past two years  and that continuing uncertainty about financial markets and the financial services sector could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
uncertain economic conditions may continue to affect our revenues 
we believe that the market for large investment management software systems may be negatively impacted by a number of factors  including reductions in capital expenditures by large customers  poor performance of major financial markets  and increasing competition 
those factors may  in turn  give rise to a number of market trends which we have experienced in the past two years that have slowed revenue growth across the financial services industry  including longer sales and contracting cycles  deferral or delay of information technology projects and generally reduced expenditures for software and related services 
if the downturn in the financial services industry and information technology spending continues  the presence of these factors in the market for 
table of contents 
index to financial statements large investment management solutions will likely materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we face intense competition 
the market for investment management software is intensely competitive and highly fragmented  is subject to rapid change and is sensitive to new product introductions and marketing efforts by industry participants 
our largest single source of competition is from proprietary systems used by existing and potential clients  many of whom develop their own software for their particular needs and therefore may be reluctant to license software products offered by independent vendors like advent 
other competitors include providers of software and related services as well as providers of outsourced services  and include some of the following vendors beauchamp  charles river development  checkfree corporation  sungard  the eagle subsidiary of mellon financial corporation  eze castle software  financial models company  inc  ft integretorsia  ibsi  ids  indata  linedata  macgregor financial technologies  schwab performance technologies  simcorp a s  ss c technologies  inc  the portia division of thomson financial and others 
our competitors vary in size  scope of services offered and platforms supported 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  we also face competition from potential new entrants into our market that may develop innovative technologies or business models 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures will not result in price reductions  reduced operating margins or loss of market share  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
we must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
new products based on new technologies or new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result  our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop new products or product enhancements that address the future needs of our target markets and to respond to these changing standards and practices 
we may not be successful in developing  introducing and marketing new products or product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis  or at all  and our new products and product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance 
delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of new products or enhancements may result in client dissatisfaction and delay or loss of product revenues 
in addition  clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or product enhancements 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products or enhancements of existing products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or client requirements  or if new products or new versions of existing products do not achieve market acceptance  our business would be seriously harmed 
in addition  our ability to develop new products and product enhancements is dependent upon the products of other software vendors  including certain system software vendors  such as microsoft corporation  sun microsystems  database vendors and development tool vendors 
if the products of such vendors have design defects or flaws  are unexpectedly delayed in their introduction  or are unavailable on acceptable terms  our business could be seriously harmed 
our software products are complex and may contain undetected defects or errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
although we have not experienced adverse effects resulting from any software errors  we cannot be sure that  despite testing by us and our clients  defects or errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could seriously harm our business 
we must retain and recruit key employees 
we believe that our future success is dependent on the continued employment of our senior management and our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified technical  sales and other personnel 
we need 
table of contents 
index to financial statements technical resources such as our product development engineers to develop new products and enhance existing products and we rely upon sales personnel to sell our products and services and maintain healthy business relationships 
we therefore need to identify  attract  motivate and retain such employees with the requisite education  backgrounds and industry experience 
if we are unable to do so  our business could be harmed 
in addition  we must attract and retain financial and accounting personnel to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of we have relied on our ability to grant equity compensation as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining such highly skilled personnel 
recently enacted accounting regulations requiring the expensing of equity compensation may impair our ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs 
if we are unable to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel  our business may be harmed 
we may also choose to create additional performance and retention incentives in order to retain our employees  including the granting of additional stock options to employees at current prices or issuing incentive cash bonuses 
such incentives may either dilute our existing stockholder base or result in unforeseen operating expenses  which may cause our stock price to fall 
we face challenges in expanding our international operations 
we market and sell our products in the united states and  to a lesser extent  internationally 
in  we entered into a distributor relationship with advent europe  an independent distributor of our products in selected european markets 
in november  we acquired the norwegian  swedish  and danish companies of this independent distributor 
in september  we purchased their greek subsidiary  in may  we purchased their dutch subsidiary  and in may  we purchased their remaining subsidiaries in the united kingdom and switzerland and certain assets of advent europe 
to further expand our international operations  we would need to establish additional locations  acquire other businesses or enter into additional distribution relationships in other parts of the world 
any further expansion of our existing international operations and entry into new international markets could require significant management attention and financial resources 
we cannot be certain that establishing businesses in other countries will produce the desired levels of revenues 
we currently have limited experience in developing localized versions of our products and marketing and distributing our products internationally 
in addition  international operations are subject to other inherent risks  including the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties in successfully adapting our products to the language  regulatory and technology standards of other countries  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  and political and economic instability 
the revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries are primarily denominated in local currencies 
we have not historically undertaken foreign exchange hedging transactions to cover potential foreign currency exposure 
future fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect revenues and accounts receivable from international sales and the us dollar value of our foreign subsidiaries revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
our international revenues from our european subsidiaries are generally denominated in local foreign currencies  with the exception of our geneva license transactions 

table of contents 
index to financial statements difficulties in integrating our acquisitions and expansion into new business areas have impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business and we face risks associated with potential acquisitions  investments  divestitures and expansion 
from through the middle of  our strategy focused on growth through the acquisition of additional complementary businesses 
during those years  we made five major acquisitions including kinexus corporation  techfi corporation and advent outsource data management llc  and also acquired all of the common stock of five of our european distributor s subsidiaries 
in addition  we purchased our european distributor s remaining two subsidiaries in the united kingdom and switzerland in may the complex process of integrating our acquisitions has required and will continue to require significant resources  particularly in light of our relative inexperience in integrating acquisitions 
integrating these acquisitions has been and will continue to be time consuming  expensive and disruptive to our business 
this integration process has strained and could continue to strain our managerial resources  resulting in the diversion of these resources from our core business objectives 
failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or to successfully integrate the operations of these entities has harmed and could continue to harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
for example  in the first quarter of  we closed our australian subsidiary because it failed to perform at a satisfactory profit level 
in addition  as we have expanded into new business areas and offerings through strategic alliances and internal development  as well as acquisitions  some of this expansion has required significant management time and resources without generating significant revenues 
we have had difficulty and may continue to have difficulty creating demand for such offerings  and revenue growth for these newer business areas has suffered and may continue to suffer 
for example  demand for our techfi product line was significantly lower than expected and thus we discontinued certain products within our techfi product line in september as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in the third quarter of to write off the carrying value of certain techfi related intangible assets 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions because of the following significant challenges expected synergy benefits from these acquisitions  such as lower costs or increased revenues  may not be realized or may be realized more slowly than anticipated  particularly with regard to costs associated with reductions in headcount and facilities  potentially incompatible cultural differences between the companies  incorporating these companies technologies and products into our current and future product lines  geographic dispersion of operations and the complexities of international operations  integrating the technical teams of these companies with our engineering organizations  generating market demand for an expanded product line  integrating the products of these companies with our business  because we do not have distribution  manufacturing  marketing or support experience for these products  the difficulty of leveraging our combined technologies and capabilities across all product lines and customer bases  and our inability to retain significant customers or key employees of these entities 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs and commit significant management time in integrating the operations  technology  development programs  products  administrative and information systems  customers and personnel of these acquisitions 
these costs have been and will likely continue to be substantial and include costs for integrating and reorganizing operations  including combining teams  facilities and processes in various functional areas  
table of contents 
index to financial statements identifying duplicative or redundant resources and facilities  developing plans for resource consolidation and implementing those plans  fees and expenses of professionals and consultants involved in completing the integration process  settling existing liabilities of these companies  uncovering through our audit process new issues reflected on the companies financial statements  vacating  sub leasing and closing facilities  employee relocation  redeployment or severance costs  discontinuing certain products and services  integrating technology and products  and other transaction costs associated with the acquisition  including financial advisor  attorney  accountant and exchange agent fees 
we may make additional acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies in the future 
in addition  we periodically evaluate the performance of all our products and services and may sell or discontinue current products and services 
failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of any future acquisition or divestiture could also harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt  write off investments  infrastructure costs or other assets  incur severance liabilities  write off impaired goodwill or other intangible assets or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities could dilute our existing stockholders ownership 
finally  we may not identify suitable businesses to acquire or negotiate acceptable terms for acquisitions 
difficulties we may encounter managing changes in the size of our business could adversely affect our operating results 
our business has experienced years of rapid growth in and through both internal expansion and acquisitions  followed by reduced revenues in and  and significant downsizing during and these changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant strain on our infrastructure  internal systems and managerial resources 
beginning in  we took steps to better align our resources with our operating requirements in order to increase our efficiency 
through these steps  we reduced our headcount  closed selected offices and incurred charges for employee severance and excess facilities capacity 
while we believe that these steps help us achieve greater operating efficiency  we have limited history with such measures and the results of these measures are less than predictable 
additional restructuring efforts may be required 
to manage our business effectively  we must continue to streamline our infrastructure  including operating and administrative systems and controls  and continue managing headcount  capital and processes in an efficient manner 
we believe workforce reductions  management changes and facility consolidation create anxiety and uncertainty and may adversely affect employee morale 
these measures could adversely affect our employees that we wish to retain and may also adversely affect our ability to hire new personnel 
in addition  our revenues may not grow in alignment with our headcount 
writing off investments could harm our results of operations 
we have made investments in privately held companies  which we classify as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
the value of these investments is influenced by many factors  including the operating effectiveness of these companies  the overall health of these companies industries  the strength of the private equity markets and general market conditions 
due to these and other factors  we have previously determined  and may in the future determine  that the value of these investments is impaired  which has caused and would cause us to write down the carrying value of these investments  such as the write downs of our investments of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
furthermore  we cannot be 
table of contents 
index to financial statements sure that future investment  license  fixed asset or other asset write downs will not happen  particularly if the downturn in the financial services industry and the decline in information technology spending continues 
if future write downs do occur  they could harm our business and results of operations 
information we provide to investors is accurate only as of the date we disseminate it 
from time to time  we may publicly disseminate forward looking information or guidance in compliance with regulation fd 
this information or guidance represents our outlook only as of the date we disseminate it  and we do not undertake to update such information or guidance 
our stock price has fluctuated significantly 
like many companies in the technology and emerging growth sector  our stock price may be subject to wide fluctuations  particularly during times of high market volatility 
if net revenues or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations  our stock price is likely to decline 
in addition  our stock price is affected by trends in the financial services sector and by broader market trends unrelated to our performance 
for instance  in the event of increased hostilities abroad or additional terrorist attacks  there could be increased market volatility  which could negatively impact our stock price 
if our relationship with financial times interactive data is terminated  our business may be harmed 
many of our clients use our proprietary interface to electronically retrieve pricing and other data from financial times interactive data ftid 
ftid pays us a commission based on their revenues from providing this data to our clients 
our software products have been customized to be compatible with their system and this software would need to be redesigned if their services were unavailable for any reason 
termination of our agreement with ftid would require at least two years notice by either us or them  or days in the case of material breach 
our revenue could be adversely impacted if our relationship with ftid were terminated or their services were unavailable to our clients for any reason 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased competition that could seriously harm our business 
our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology 
we currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we have registered trademarks for many of our products and services and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with our resellers and customers 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
despite these efforts  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information 
we do not have any patents  and existing copyright and trade secret laws afford only limited protection 
in addition  we cannot be certain that others will not develop substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology  or that equivalent products will not be marketed in competition with our products  thereby substantially reducing the value of our proprietary rights 
we cannot be sure that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  that any patent  if issued  would provide us with any competitive advantages or would not be challenged by third parties  or that the patents of others will not adversely affect our ability to do business 
litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology 
this litigation may be time consuming and expensive 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
we cannot be sure that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any patent that may be issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 

table of contents 
index to financial statements if we infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we may incur additional costs or be prevented from selling our products and services 
we cannot be certain that our products or services do not infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
as a result  we may be subject to litigation and claims  including claims of infringement of patents  copyrights and other intellectual property rights of third parties that would be time consuming and costly to resolve 
if we discovered that our products or services violated the intellectual property rights of third parties  we would have to make substantial changes to our products or services or obtain licenses from such third parties 
we might not be able to obtain such licenses on favorable terms or at all  and we may be unable to change our products successfully or in a timely manner 
failure to resolve an infringement matter successfully or in a timely manner  would force us to incur significant costs  including damages  redevelopment costs  diversion of management s attention and satisfaction of indemnification obligations that we have with our clients  as well as prevent us from selling certain products or services 
business disruptions could adversely affect our business 
our operations are exposed to potential disruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  and other events beyond our control 
additionally  we are vulnerable to disruption caused by political and terrorist incidents 
for example  our facilities in new york were temporarily closed due to the september  terrorist attacks 
immediately after the terrorist attacks  our clients who were located in the world trade center area were concentrating on disaster recovery rather than licensing additional software components  while the grounding of transportation impeded our ability to deliver professional services at client sites 
additionally  during the temporary closure of the us stock markets  our clients did not use our market data services 
our corporate headquarters is located in the san francisco bay area  which is a region with significant seismic activity 
earthquakes such as that experienced in could disrupt our business 
such disruptions could affect our ability to sell and deliver products and services and other critical functions of our business and could seriously harm us 
further  such events could cause instability in the financial markets upon which we depend 
undetected software errors or failures found in new products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products that could seriously harm our business 
our products may contain undetected software errors or failures or scalability limitations at any point in the life of the product  but particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released 
despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or a delay in market acceptance  damage to our reputation  customer dissatisfaction and reductions in revenues and margins  any of which could seriously harm our business 
additionally  our agreements with customers that attempt to limit our exposure to liability claims may not be enforceable in jurisdictions where we operate 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations will increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act the act of  which became law in july  requires changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure and or compliance practices 
as part of the act s requirements  the securities and exchange commission has been promulgating new rules on a variety of subjects  in addition to other rule proposals  and the nasdaq stock market has enacted new corporate governance listing requirements 
these developments have increased our accounting and legal compliance costs and could also expose us to additional liability 
in fiscal  we have incurred approximately million in sarbanes oxley related expenses 
in addition  such developments may make retention and recruitment of qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or executive management more difficult 
we continue to evaluate and monitor regulatory and legislative developments and cannot reliably estimate the timing or magnitude of all costs we may incur as a result of the act or other related legislation or regulation 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our financial results could be affected by changes in the accounting rules governing the recognition of stock based compensation expense 
we measure compensation expense for our employee stock compensation plans under the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supercedes apb sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas  no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in our third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition method includes prospective and retroactive adoption methods 
under the retroactive method  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive method would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas security risks may harm our business 
a significant barrier to commerce and communications over public networks is the secure transmission of confidential information 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services or operations 
in addition  computer viruses or software programs that disable or impair computers could be introduced into our systems or those of our customers or other third parties  which could disrupt or make our systems inaccessible to customers 
our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches  which could harm our business  exposing us to a risk of loss  litigation and other possible liabilities  as well as possibly requiring us to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results 
as a result  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports 
if we can not provide reliable financial reports  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we have in the past discovered  and may in the future discover  areas of our internal controls that need improvement including control deficiencies that may constitute material weakness 
for example  as of december   the company did not maintain effective controls over the valuation of its property and equipment accounts  including the related restructuring provision 
specifically  the company s impairment analysis of its property and equipment accounts related to its decision to vacate a facility failed to identify and include all applicable assets 
this control deficiency resulted in a restatement of the company s financial statements for the quarters ended june  and september  and an adjustment to the fourth quarter financial statements 
additionally  this control deficiency could result in a misstatement to the property and equipment accounts and related 
table of contents 
index to financial statements restructuring provision that would result in a material misstatement to annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected 
the company also did not maintain effective controls over the accounting for income taxes  including the determination of income taxes payable  deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the related income tax provision as of december  specifically  the company did not have controls to identify that deferred income tax assets and related deferred income tax valuation allowances had been inappropriately recorded 
further  the company did not have controls in place to include all state income tax liabilities in its income taxes payable account 
these control deficiencies resulted in a restatement of the company s financial statements for the year ended december   the quarters ended march   june  and september   and an adjustment to the fourth quarter financial statements 
additionally  these control deficiencies could result in a misstatement to the income taxes payable  deferred income tax asset and liabilities  and income tax provision accounts that would result in a material misstatement to annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected 
management has determined that these control deficiencies constituted material weaknesses as of december  consequently  management has concluded that the company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december  based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control integrated framework 
the company has begun executing on a remediation plan  as discussed in management s report on internal control over financial reporting in item of this report  and expects to have implemented the new control procedures and to have hired additional tax accounting personnel by the end of the second quarter of any failure to implement and maintain the improvements in our internal controls over financial reporting  or difficulties encountered in the implementation of these improvements in our controls  could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
any failure to improve our internal controls to address these identified weaknesses could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
historically  much of our revenues and capital spending was transacted in us dollars 
however  since the acquisitions of advent denmark  advent norway  advent sweden  advent hellas  advent netherlands  and advent europe s remaining distributors in the united kingdom and switzerland  whose revenues  with the exception of geneva transactions and capital spending  are transacted in local country currencies  we have greater exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
because the results of operations from these territories are not material to our operating results  a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted of million in cash equivalents and million in marketable securities as of december  an immediate sharp increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  immediate sharp declines in interest rates could seriously harm interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio  nor hedge for these interest rate exposures 
by policy  we limit our exposure to longer term investments  and the majority of our investment portfolio at december  and had interest rate maturities of less than one year 
as a result of the relatively short duration of our portfolio  an immediate hypothetical parallel shift to the yield curve of plus basis points bps  bps and bps would result in a reduction of   and  respectively  in the market value of our investment portfolio as of december  we have also invested in several privately held companies  most of which can still be considered in the start up or development stages 
these non marketable investments are classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
our investments in privately held companies could be affected by an adverse movement in the financial markets for publicly traded equity securities  although the impact cannot be directly quantified 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products these privately held companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
the value of these investments is also influenced by factors including the operating effectiveness of these companies  the overall health of the companies industries and the strength of the private equity markets 
we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
at december   our net investments in privately held companies totaled million
