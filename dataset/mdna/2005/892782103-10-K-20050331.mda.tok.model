vessel capacity utilization on the core continental us to puerto rico traffic lane was during  compared to during domestic revenue is for moves that originate and terminate within the continental united states 
the decrease in domestic line haul revenue was primarily the result of less domestic linehaul within the continental united states  because of increased demand in the puerto rico shipping lane 
this change in demand resulted in less equipment available for domestic linehaul

vessels currently the company owns five tbcs 
of these vessels two are used for liner service between san juan  puerto rico and jacksonville  florida 
in the revenue earned from these two vessels was approximately million in comparison to million in the prior year 
of the remaining three vessels that were originally used in newark  new jersey  one was leased to an unrelated third party during the first quarter of at an approximate annual rent of million and the remaining two vessels are available for charter 
the charter agreement will expire in april of but can be renewed up until january of management continues to evaluate the use of the two vessels and no determination has been made as to their final use 
as an alternative to their current use management has considered using one vessel as a ready spare  relieving the other vessels in the fleet during periods of dry docking in order to protect market share and keep established shipping routes open  and possibly leasing the other vessel under a similar contract to the agreement reached during ultimately management intends to use all of these vessels on expanded trade routes throughout the american continents and surrounding island countries  as new markets become available and are considered to be economically feasible 
it is the management s belief that based on the current cash flows derived from the tbc vessels and their current market value as determined by an independent appraiser  that the current excess capacity of the two vessels  available for charter  does not indicate an impairment

million in this represented a decrease of million from million of the decrease is directly related to the purchase of equipment primarily the ro ro vessels and revenue equipment from the proceeds of the senior secured notes in december million of the decrease is result of a required contractual deposit related to the ship financing bonds and the notes  title xi debt 
net cash provided in financing activities was million in compared to net cash used by financing activities of million in representing an increase of million

during the period between and  the company operated in a trade lane that was characterized by significant over capacity and fierce competition 
this over capacity and competition resulted in significant and prolonged rate decreases throughout that period 
similarly  the company s ability to pass on certain expenses to customers  through surcharges and other customer charges was severely hampered due to competition 
as a result  during the years ended december  and  the company incurred net losses applicable to common shares of  and  respectively and had cash flows provided used by operating activities of  and  respectively as well page as a working capital deficiency of  and  at december  and respectively 
also during this period  one of the trade lane s largest participants filed bankruptcy and  after operating in bankruptcy for approximately months  sold its vessel assets to another competitor in the trade 
with a realignment of capacity and demand in the trade lane  resulted in a redistribution of freight volume among the remaining four participants  which resulted in increased volume and capacity utilization 
during the fourth quarter of  the company began to implement increases in customer rates and surcharges 
in addition to the revenue increases  the company also implemented several changes to reduce cost 
this increase in rates and utilization of capacity helped the company improve its operating position for the current year 
for the year ended december  earnings available to common shareholders were  and as of december   working capital was  the most notable changes for were made in purchased transportation  healthcare costs and tug fuel consumption

based upon the foregoing  the company believes that it will be able to maintain the increased vessel capacity utilization at these increased rates over the foreseeable future 
the trade lane in which the company operates in is protected by a number of barriers to entry  the most formidable of which is the jones act that requires that vessels serving the trade lane be built in the united states  operated by united states citizens and crewed by united states citizens 
other barriers to entry include limited port space in san juan 
both act as major constraints to the addition of new capacity

p 
mclean 
the company s chief executive officer  john mccown  personally guarantees approximately million of this debt 
all other amounts owed to affiliates were repaid with a portion of the proceeds of the million note offering completed december  this restructure of debt  along with increased rates and vessel utilization are expected to allow us to meet our working capital requirements through december  during previous years  due to overcapacity and hyper competitiveness in the united states puerto rico trade lane in which the company operates  it had significant negative cash flow from operations 
the conditions in the united states puerto rico trade lane have changed significantly and the company now has significant positive cash flow from operations which is expected to continue over the foreseeable future

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of certain accounting policies  many of which requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in these financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
management believes the application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  management has found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
page the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition 
voyage revenue is recognized ratably over the duration of a voyage based on the relative transit time in each reporting period  commonly referred to as the percentage of completion method 
voyage expenses are recognized as incurred 
demurrage and charterhire revenue are included in our revenues 
demurrage is a charge assessed for failure to return empty freight equipment on time 
charter hire is rental revenue for vessels not in use in a liner service 
the company recognizes demurrage and charterhire revenue based on negotiated fees included in the contracts of our customers 
these amounts are computed daily and included in operating revenue 
useful life and salvage values 
the company reviews the selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating our property and equipment 
depreciable lives of property and equipment range from to years 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sales are based on the expected values of equipment at the time of disposal 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and ultimately  the gain or losses on the disposal of the asset 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the carrying amounts and periods over which long lived assets are depreciated to determine if events have occurred which would require modification to our carrying values or useful lives 
in evaluating useful lives and carrying values of long lived assets  the company reviews certain indicators of potential impairment  such as undiscounted projected operating cash flows  replacement costs of such assets  business plans and overall market conditions 
the company determines undiscounted projected net operating cash flows and compares it to the carrying value 
in the event that impairment occurred  the company would determine the fair value of the related asset and record a charge to operations calculated by comparing the asset s carrying value to the estimated fair value 
the company estimates fair value primarily through the use of third party valuations 
in  the company recorded an impairment charge on our triplestack box carriers r barges amounting to approximately million 
the company recognized no impairments in  or in the fourth quarter of  the company had an appraisal performed on these vessels 
the results of this appraisal listed the fair market value of these same vessels at million as compared to a net book value of million 
uncollectible accounts 
the company records a monthly accrual provision based on specific known collectibility problems  historical losses  and current economic information 
in addition  the company performs an analysis of the total receivables on a quarterly basis  and adjusts the provision account to the calculated balance 
it is our policy to write off receivables once the account reaches days past due or it is determined that additional efforts of collection will not result in the receipt of the receivable 
during the years ended december   and the company provided   and  respectively for uncollectible accounts 
the company records this expense in other operating expenses 
the trade receivable balances during the corresponding period were million  million and million for  and respectively 
the trade receivable balance increase in of was due the million increase in revenue earned in the fourth quarter of over the fourth quarter of the increase in revenue was primarily the result of higher volume and higher yields 
the revenue in the fourth quarter of and was million and million  respectively 
however  the year end balance for the allowance account was reduced by  and  for the years ended december  and  due to better collection of demurrage revenues and current receivables 
income taxes

accounting for income taxes 
valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
page management is currently evaluating the deferred tax valuation allowance  to determine what portion  if any of the deferred tax asset that may be realized in the future 
management s evaluation includes  among other things  such factors as a consistent history of profitability  a substantial history of operations upon which to base a forecast and a history of accurately forecasting future results of operations 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with less management judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see the company s audited financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
new accounting pronouncements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised  shared based payment 
statement r addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
statement r requires an entity to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees in the income statement 
the revised statement generally requires that an entity account for those transactions using the fair value based method  and eliminates the intrinsic value method of accounting in apb opinion no
