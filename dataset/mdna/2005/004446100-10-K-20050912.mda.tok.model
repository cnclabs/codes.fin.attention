item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we are reporting net sales of  for the year ended june  this represents a increase over the  reported in fiscal year gross profit for the year was  which represents the highest gross profit ever recorded by aceto despite a decline in the gross margin to from in the prior year 
our selling  general and administrative costs increased to  an increase of over the  we reported in fiscal this increase was due to the inclusion of a full year of results for pharma waldhof  which was acquired in december  as well as professional fees associated with our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
our net income decreased to  or per diluted share  a decrease of compared to fiscal year our financial position as of june   remains strong  as we had cash of  working capital of  no long term debt and shareholders equity of  our business is separated into four principal segments health sciences  chemicals colorants  agrochemicals and institutional sanitary supplies 
the health sciences segment is our largest segment both in sales and gross profits 
this segment is comprised of apis  pharmaceutical intermediates  diagnostic chemicals  biopharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements 
apis comprise about of this segment s revenues 
we typically partner with both customers and suppliers years in advance of a drug coming off patent to provide the generic equivalent 
we have an extensive pipeline of new generic products poised to reach commercial levels over the coming years as the patents on existing drugs expire  both in the united states and europe 
in addition  as new members join the european union  primarily from eastern europe  they become subject to the same regulatory standards as their western european counterparts 
given our regulatory expertise  we believe that this represents an opportunity for us  and we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of that opportunity 
the chemicals colorants segment supplies chemicals used in the color producing industries such as the textiles  ink  paper and coatings industries  as well as chemicals used in plastic  resins  adhesives  coatings  food  flavor additives  and the production of agrochemicals 
our customers for these products are predominantly located in the united states  and we purchase the products primarily from manufacturers located in china and western europe 
the agrochemicals segment  while relatively small in terms of sales  is our most profitable in terms of gross margin percentages 
this segment sells herbicides  pesticides  and other agricultural chemicals to customers primarily located in the united states and western europe 
our joint venture with nufarm  which markets butoxone r  is expected to increase our market share of the peanut  soybean and alfalfa herbicide markets 
on december   our management committed to a plan to sell the entire institutional sanitary supplies segment 
accordingly  for the six and nine months ended december  and march   respectively  the quarterly results of this segment were included in loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income 
during june  we entered into an agreement to sell the majority of the product lines formulated and marketed by cdc products corp 
cdc  which is one of the two subsidiaries forming this segment 
the sale of certain product lines of cdc was completed on august  excluded from the sale of cdc s product lines was anti clog  an epa registered biocide that has a unique delivery system and is used in commercial air conditioning systems 
three factors influenced our decision to retain this product we did not receive any offers that we felt adequately valued the anti clog business  we believe that anti clog has significant growth potential  and production of anti clog can be easily outsourced and its product management can be merged into our chemicals and colorants segment 
as a result of our decision to retain the anti clog product  we have reclassified all of cdc s operating results from discontinued operations to continuing operations in the consolidated statements of income 
on september   we completed the sale of certain assets of magnum research corp  the remaining subsidiary forming part of the institutional sanitary supplies segment  the operating results of which continue to be included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income 
we plan to discontinue the use of the leased space previously occupied by cdc and magnum research corp 
and may incur a related charge for the lease  which expires in november our main strengths are sourcing  regulatory support and quality control 
we are currently the largest buyer of pharmaceutical and specialty chemicals for export from china  purchasing from over different factories 
also among our greatest strengths are our people and their ability to meet the individual needs of customers 
approximately of our employees have technical degrees  and we have approximately employees whose exclusive responsibility is regulatory compliance 
this enables us to dispatch highly skilled professionals whenever they might be needed 
in this section  we explain our general financial condition and results of operations  including the following o factors that affect our business o our earnings and costs in the periods presented o changes in earnings and costs between periods o sources of earnings o the impact of these factors on our overall financial condition as you read this section  refer to the accompanying consolidated statements of income  which present the results of our operations for the three years ended june  we analyze and explain the differences between periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of income 
critical accounting estimates and policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing these financial statements  we were required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate our estimates including those related to allowances for bad debts  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  environmental and other contingencies  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on various factors  including historical experience  advice from outside subject matter experts  and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which together form the basis for our making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affected our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of any product when it is shipped and title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
we have no acceptance or other post shipment obligations and we do not offer product warranties or services to our customers 
sales are recorded net of returns of damaged goods from customers  which historically have been immaterial  and sales incentives offered to customers 
sales incentives consist primarily of volume incentive rebates 
we record volume incentive rebates as the underlying revenue transactions that result in progress by the customer in earning the rebate are recorded  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts relating to estimated losses resulting from customers being unable to make required payments 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based on historical experience and known factors regarding specific customers and the industries in which those customers operate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their ability to make payments being impaired  additional allowances would be required 
inventories inventories  which consist principally of finished goods  are stated at the lower of cost first in first out method or market 
we write down our inventories for estimated excess and obsolete goods by an amount equal to the difference between the carrying cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
a significant sudden increase in demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases  while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  we may overestimate or underestimate the demand for our products which would result in our understating or overstating  respectively  the write down required for excess and obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the value of their underlying net assets 
other intangible assets principally consist of customer relationships  trademarks  purchased customer lists  and covenants not to compete 
goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized 
effective july   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas no 
 upon adoption we performed impairment tests on goodwill as of july  as a result of the impairment tests  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of  which has been included as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended june  as also required by sfas no 
 we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis 
to determine the fair value of these intangible assets  we use many assumptions and estimates that directly impact the results of the testing 
in making these assumptions and estimates  we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management 
additionally  we use as necessary  an outside valuation firm to help us evaluate recorded goodwill 
if our estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
environmental and other contingencies we establish accrued liabilities for environmental matters and other contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can reasonably be estimated 
if the contingency is resolved for an amount greater or less than the accrual  or our share of the contingency increases or decreases  or other assumptions relevant to the development of the estimate were to change  we would recognize an additional expense or benefit in income in the period that the determination was made 
taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
it requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
as of june   we had current net deferred tax assets of  and non current net deferred tax assets of  these net deferred tax assets have been recorded based on our projecting that we will have sufficient future earnings to realize these assets  and the net deferred tax assets have been provided for at currently enacted income tax rates 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize a deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net income at that time 
deferred taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since substantially all of these earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested in our foreign operations 
a deferred tax liability will be recognized when we expect that we will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner  such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments 
determination of the amount of the unrecognized us income tax liability is not practical because of the complexities of the hypothetical calculation 
in addition  unrecognized foreign tax credit carryforwards would be available to reduce a portion of such us tax liability

net sales net sales increased  or  to  for the year ended june   compared with  for the prior year 
we reported sales increases in our three largest segments  as explained below 
health sciences net sales for the health sciences segment increased by  for the year ended june   to  which represents a increase over net sales of  for the prior year 
several factors contributed to the net increase in net sales in the health sciences segment 
the pharma waldhof business  which we acquired on december   contributed  towards the sales increase 
domestic sales of health science products increased  during fiscal year as compared to the prior year  partly due to sales of pharmaceutical intermediates increasing by  or compared to the prior year 
the large increase in sales of pharmaceutical intermediates reflects the change in attitude by some of the larger pharmaceutical companies towards securing a second  lower cost supplier in asia 
we believe that sales of this product line will continue to increase 
the european and asian market excluding pharma waldhof recorded a net decrease in sales of  as compared to the prior year 
contributing to the net decline in asian sales was the  decrease in sales of two previously launched apis due to increased competition 
this decrease was partially offset by a  increase in sales of two relatively new products over last year 
chemicals colorants net sales for the chemicals colorants segment was  for the year ended june   compared to  for the prior year 
this increase of  or  over the prior year is partially attributable to a steady increase in the number of products being offered by our foreign subsidiaries 
sales of chemicals colorants products by our foreign subsidiaries for the year ended june   showed an increase of  over the prior year 
our chemical business is diverse in terms of products  customers and consuming markets 
one customer within our color pigment and pigment intermediate business purchased  less product during fiscal year this reduction was more than offset by a  increase over the prior year in domestic sales of our industrial chemical offerings  in particular products with increased sales were polymer additives  agricultural intermediates  and coatings 
agrochemicals net sales for the agrochemical segment increased to  for the year ended june   an increase of  or  over net sales of  for the prior year 
the increase in net sales was attributable to higher sales of our two highest volume products 
gross profit gross profit by segment before unallocated cost of sales primarily storage and certain freight costs increased  to  of net sales for the year ended june   as compared to  of net sales for the prior year 
health sciences health sciences gross profit of  for the year ended june   was or lower than the prior year 
the gross margin decreased to compared to a gross margin of for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributed to the lower than normal api gross margin of realized on a relaunched antibiotic and a shift in product mix to pharmaceutical intermediates  which generally have lower margins than apis 
additionally  two of our larger previously launched apis in europe and asia have experienced significant pricing pressures  which further affected our gross profit and gross margin 
we expect pricing pressures on previously launched apis to continue in the short term 
chemicals colorants gross profit for the year ended june   increased by  or  over the prior year 
gross profit for fiscal year included a favorable adjustment of due to the reversal of an accrual for the estimated loss of a purchase contract 
excluding this adjustment  gross profit would have increased by  or 
excluding the adjustment  the segment would have shown improved margins of versus for the prior year 
contributions from categories such as polymer additives  agricultural intermediates and coatings  in addition to improved sales volume and margins in the european markets  were the primary reasons for this improvement 
the increase in gross margin percentage was caused by a decrease in sales to one major customer whose sales had generated lower margins than usual  along with an improvement in margins across other categories due to changes in product mix and  in some cases  improved product pricing 
agrochemicals gross profit for the agrochemicals segment increased to  for the year ended june   versus  for the prior year  an increase of  or 
this increase resulted from a large increase in sales of our two highest volume products  improved royalty income of one existing product  and a price increase in another product 
unallocated cost of sales increased  to  in fiscal  compared to  in the prior year  representing a increase 
the higher costs were mainly a result of higher freight costs due to rising fuel surcharges and increased sales and shipments to customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased  or  to  for the year ended june  compared to  for the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of  of expenses of pharma waldhof  which was acquired in december  additional increases in costs of for new business development initiatives including new personnel  an asset impairment charge of relating to our institutional sanitary supplies segment  additional legal fees in our agricultural business of  increased fees associated with the planning and pre implementation efforts of a new enterprise resource planning  or erp  system of  an increase in fees relating to our audit services and compliance with our obligations under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and increased compensation and related fringe benefit costs of  operating income in fiscal year operating income was  compared to  in the prior year  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was due to the  increase in sg a expenses  which was partially offset by the overall increase in gross profit of interest and other income expense interest and other income of  for fiscal year represents a slight decrease from  in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in miscellaneous income of  which was partially offset by a decrease of for minority interest and an increase in the government subsidy we receive for doing business in a free trade zone in shanghai  china in the amount of provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal year decreased to from for fiscal year the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to recognition of certain deferred tax assets for foreign net operating loss carryforwards  which previously were fully offset by a valuation allowance in the amount of  partially offset by increased earnings in foreign tax jurisdictions with higher tax rates  primarily germany 
discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the results of operations for one of the subsidiaries forming part of the institutional sanitary supplies segment have been recorded as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the net loss from discontinued operations was  and for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
the net loss from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended includes a non cash write down of goodwill  net of an income tax benefit  of results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net sales by segment year ended june  comparison over under of of segment net sales total net sales total change change health sciences    chemicals colorants    agrochemicals    institutional sanitary supplies   net sales    gross profit by segment year ended june  comparison over under gross of gross of segment profit sales profit sales change change health sciences    chemicals colorants    agrochemicals    institutional sanitary supplies   segment gross profit    freight and storage costs   gross profit    represents certain freight and storage costs that are not allocated to a segment 
net sales net sales increased  or  to  for the fiscal year ended june  compared with  for the prior year 
we reported particularly strong sales and gross profit for the year ended june  for the health sciences segment  as explained below 
net sales for the other three segments combined increased  or in fiscal health sciences the health sciences segment reported a significant increase in sales and accounted for of the overall increase in this segment has achieved gains in market share and experienced strong demand for certain active pharmaceutical ingredients apis launched during fiscal and this segment s sales were  for fiscal versus  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
the primary reason for the improvement in revenue was an increase of  attributable to follow up shipments of several apis that were launched in fiscal and sold to companies that had received approval to market these products 
some of these increases were offset  however  by a decrease in sales volume of one api  which had sales of  in fiscal compared to  during fiscal this represents an example of the possible life cycle of a generic pharmaceutical product the product launch period can be followed by a reduction in volume once the initial distribution channels are filled 
the segment increase can also be attributed to the overall increase in sales volume from our foreign subsidiaries of  net of the increase in follow up api sales mentioned above 
the foreign subsidiaries increased sales is attributed to the acquisition of pharma waldhof which contributed  of the increase  the effect of foreign currency rate changes due to the strengthening of the euro  an expanded distribution agreement with a major supplier  sales from new products and improved market penetration 
the nutritionals product line within this segment reported an increase of  or over fiscal  primarily due to increased demand for two products within our nutritional supplements offering 
chemicals colorants in fiscal  the chemicals colorants segment achieved an increase of  or  to  compared to  in fiscal last year s sales included a favorable adjustment from a negotiated settlement for the lost gross margin regarding non performance of a sales contract 
sales were up  or when this adjustment is excluded from last year s sales 
the segment s increase is primarily attributable to increased sales of  from our foreign subsidiaries 
one large customer within our color pigment and pigment intermediates business purchased  less product in fiscal than in fiscal this loss was offset by increases of  within the aroma chemicals  food and beverage  miscellaneous intermediates and solvents categories 
agrochemicals agrochemicals sales were  for compared to  in the prior year  an increase of  or 
the increase in sales was due primarily to the introduction of three new products totaling  and increased sales of butoxone r from our joint venture with nufarm americas of institutional sanitary supplies institutional sanitary supplies sales were  for fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of or 
gross profit gross profit by segment before unallocated cost of sales primarily storage and certain freight costs increased in fiscal  to  from  reported in fiscal the health sciences segment made the largest contribution to this increase as it accounted for  or of the overall increase 
health sciences in fiscal  the health science segment s gross profit was  or of net sales in fiscal versus  or of net sales  in the prior year 
the increase in gross profit was largely attributable to follow up shipments of several apis that were launched in fiscal and provided a  or increase over last year at gross margin rates that were slightly lower than in the previous year 
additionally  our european operations contributed  additional gross profit  net of the increase of follow up apis mentioned in net sales  due to increased volume of new and existing products  improved market penetration and an expanded distribution agreement with a major supplier for new products in existing and new markets 
these increases in gross profit were substantially offset by lower sales and gross profit  decrease attributable to our highest sales volume api during the prior year 
gross profit for the nutritional products was or higher than the prior year  with slightly lower gross margin rates 
chemicals colorants the chemicals colorants segment s gross profit of  in fiscal represents an increase of  or over last year s gross profit of  gross margin increased to this year versus in the prior year 
the gross profit realized from initial sales from our foreign subsidiaries contributed  of the segment s overall increase 
the increased sales of  in the categories mentioned in net sales accounted for additional gross profit of gross margin rates increased due to a  decrease in sales to one major customer whose sales have generated lower than normal margins  along with an overall improvement in margins across other categories due to changes in product mix and some instances of improved pricing 
agrochemicals the agrochemicals segment s gross profit of  in fiscal represents an increase of  or  versus gross profit of  in the prior year 
gross margin increased to for fiscal as compared to in the prior year 
the increase in gross profit resulted from the introduction of three new products  the increased contribution from butoxone r  and the recovery of cost on the sale of previously marked down inventory 
in addition  last year s gross profit was reduced by an unusually large increase in packaging costs due to a change in the way a specific product was applied 
such costs did not recur in fiscal institutional sanitary supplies institutional sanitary supplies gross profits were  or in versus  or in unallocated cost of sales remained flat at  in fiscal  compared to  in the prior year  representing a increase 
the higher costs were mainly a result of higher freight costs due to rising fuel surcharges and increased sales and shipments to customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased  or to  for fiscal from  for fiscal as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal sg a increased primarily due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting from the strengthening of the euro in our euro zone operations  the acquisition of pharma waldhof  increases in professional fees  including internal control documentation and assessment as mandated by the sarbanes oxley legislation  and legal fees related to recent business agreements  product registration fees and the dismissal of a lawsuit related to a former supplier and ongoing litigation 
we sold certain real estate in fiscal and realized a net gain of on the sale 
this gain reduced overall sg a and lowered sg a as a percentage of sales 
excluding this transaction  sg a as a percentage of sales would have been last year 
operating income in fiscal operating income was  compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily due to the overall increase in gross profit of  which was partially offset by the  increase in sg a expenses 
interest and other income expense interest expense for fiscal was versus in the prior year 
the decrease was due to lower average borrowings 
interest and other income increased to  for fiscal compared to in fiscal this was partly attributable to the increase to in fiscal from in fiscal in the annual government subsidy we receive for doing business in a free trade zone in shanghai  china 
also  we recognized an unrealized gain on marketable securities of in fiscal versus an unrealized loss of in fiscal in addition  we recognized gains on foreign currency of in fiscal versus in fiscal provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in lower foreign tax jurisdictions as compared to the prior year 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for fiscal year  we recorded a one time charge of  or per diluted share  attributable to the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this charge was related to impairment of the goodwill associated with cdc products corp  one of the two subsidiaries forming our institutional sanitary supply segment and was due to the change in methodologies used to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill as required under sfas no 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows at june   we had  in cash   in short term investments and in short term bank loans 
working capital was  at june   versus  at june  our cash position at june   decreased  from the amount at june  operating activities used cash of  primarily due to inventories having been increased by  in order to take advantage of current prices in an environment of rising prices and the anticipated revaluation of the chinese currency which may increase future product costs 
this was partially offset by net income of  investing activities provided cash of  primarily as a result of net proceeds from investments of  this was partially offset by  of expenditures for property and equipment  including the purchase of office space located in shanghai  china in the amount of  financing activities used cash of  primarily as a result of payments of cash dividends of  and payment of a related party note of  which were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of credit facilities we have available credit facilities with certain foreign financial institutions 
these facilities provide us with a line of credit of  of which  in short term bank loans were outstanding and in letters of credit were utilized as of june  we are not subject to any financial covenants under these arrangements 
we have a revolving credit agreement with a financial institution that expires june   and provides for available credit of  at june   we had utilized  in letters of credit  leaving  of this facility unused 
under the credit agreement  we may obtain credit through direct borrowings and letters of credit 
our obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and are secured by of the capital of certain of our non domestic subsidiaries 
there is no borrowing base on the credit agreement 
interest under the credit agreement is at libor plus 
the credit agreement contains several covenants requiring  among other things  minimum levels of debt service and tangible net worth 
we are also subject to certain restrictive debt covenants  including covenants governing liens  limitations on indebtedness  limitations on cash dividends  guarantees  sale of assets  sales of receivables  and loans and investments 
we were in compliance with all covenants at june  working capital outlook working capital was  at june   versus  at june  the increase in working capital was primarily attributable to net income during the year 
we continually evaluate possible acquisitions of or investments in businesses that are complementary to our own  and such transactions may require the use of cash 
we believe that our cash  other liquid assets  operating cash flows  borrowing capacity and access to the equity capital markets  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating expenditures and the anticipated continuation of semi annual cash dividends for the next twelve months 
we may obtain additional credit facilities to enhance our liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements and commitments and contingencies we have no material financial commitments other than those under operating lease agreements  letters of credit and unconditional purchase obligations 
we have certain contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments that will affect our short and long term liquidity 
at june   we had no significant obligations for capital expenditures 
at june   contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments were as follows payments due and or amount of commitment expiration per period less than after total year years years years operating leases     short term bank loans commercial letters of credit   standby letters of credit unconditional purchase obligations   total     other significant commitments and contingencies include the following our non qualified deferred compensation plans are intended to provide certain executives with supplemental retirement benefits beyond our k plan  as well as to permit additional deferral of a portion of their compensation 
all compensation deferred under the plans is held by us in a grantor trust  which is considered our asset 
we had a liability under the plan of  and the assets held by the grantor trust amounted to  as of june  one of our subsidiaries markets certain agricultural chemicals which are subject to the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act fifra 
fifra requires that test data be provided to the environmental protection agency epa to register  obtain and maintain approved labels for pesticide products 
the epa requires that follow on registrants of these products compensate the initial registrant for the cost of producing the necessary test data on a basis prescribed in the fifra regulations 
follow on registrants do not themselves generate or contract for the data 
however  when fifra requirements mandate that new test data be generated to enable all registrants to continue marketing a pesticide product  often both the initial and follow on registrants establish a task force to jointly undertake the testing effort 
we are presently a member of two such task force groups and historically  our payments have been in the range of per year 
we may be required to make additional payments in the future 
we  together with our subsidiaries  are subject to pending and threatened legal proceedings that have arisen in the normal course of business 
we do not know how the final resolution of these matters will affect our results of operations in a particular reporting period 
our management is of the opinion  however  that the ultimate outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or liquidity 
related party transactions certain of our directors are affiliated with law firms that serve as our legal counsel on various corporate matters 
during fiscal years  and  we incurred legal fees of  and  respectively  for services rendered to the company by those law firms 
the fees charged by those firms were at rates comparable to rates obtainable from other firms for similar services 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
sfas no 
also requires that a change in method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors occurring in fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements  including those that are in a transition phase as of the date of sfas no 
we do not believe that adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which addresses accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and instead requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
this statement is effective for annual periods beginning after june  our fiscal year  as if all share based compensation awards granted  modified or settled after december  had been accounted for using the fair value based method of accounting 
we will use the modified prospective approach in adopting the provisions of sfas no 
r 
our adoption of sfas no 
r on july  will not have a material effect on our financial statements since all prior grants of stock options are fully vested as of june  future grants of stock options will result in compensation expense 
on october   the president of the united states signed the american jobs creation act of this law creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations  and the fasb issued two staff positions to provide guidance on how companies should account for the effects of the american jobs creation act 
we evaluated what effect the repatriation provision would have on us  and we decided not to repatriate extraordinary dividends 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments the market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in investment market prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
investment market price risk we had short term investments of  at june  those short term investments consisted of government and agency securities  corporate bonds and corporate equity securities  and they were recorded at fair value and had exposure to price risk 
if this risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices quoted by stock exchanges  the effect of that risk would be as of june  actual results may differ 
foreign currency exchange risk in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we hedge some of our transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of our various entities 
the instruments used for hedging are short term foreign currency contracts futures 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the currency of the related hedged transactions 
at june   we had foreign currency contracts outstanding that had a notional amount of  the difference between the fair market value of the foreign currency contracts and the related commitments at inception and the fair market value of the contracts and the related commitments at june   was not material 
in addition  we enter into cross currency interest rate swaps to reduce foreign currency exposure on inter company transactions 
in june we entered into a one year cross currency interest rate swap transaction  which expired in june when the underlying inter company loan was repaid  and in may we entered into a five year cross currency interest rate swap transaction  both for the purpose of hedging fixed interest rate  foreign currency denominated cash flows under inter company loans 
under the terms of these derivative financial instruments  us dollar fixed principal and interest payments to be received under inter company loans will be swapped for euro denominated fixed principal and interest payments 
the change in fair value of the swaps from date of purchase to june   was 
the gains or losses on the inter company loans due to changes in foreign currency rates will be offset by the gains or losses on the swap in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
since our interest rate swaps qualify as hedging activities  the change in their fair value  amounting to and in and  respectively  is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we are subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for our subsidiaries that use a foreign currency as their functional currency and are translated into us dollars 
these changes result in cumulative translation adjustments  which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
on june   we had translation exposure to various foreign currencies  with the most significant being the euro  the chinese renminbi and the singapore dollar 
the potential loss as of june   resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounted to  actual results may differ 
interest rate risk due to our financing  investing and cash management activities  we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates 
we utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our financial instrument holdings at year end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
in this sensitivity analysis  we used the same change in interest rate for all maturities 
all other factors were held constant 
if there were an adverse change in interest rates of  the expected effect on net income related to our financial instruments would be immaterial 
however  there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly affect our results of operations
