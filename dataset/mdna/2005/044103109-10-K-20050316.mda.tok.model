executive overview we are a real estate investment trust reit that commenced operations upon completion of our initial public offering ipo and related formation transactions on august  as of december   we owned hotels  approximately million of mezzanine loans receivable  and eight asset management and consulting contracts

we believe the lodging industry was negatively affected in by low levels of business travel resulting from a weak economy predominantly in the first half of the year  the war in iraq  continued changes in terrorist threat levels  and travel reductions and restrictions related to severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars 
however  in  strong economic growth in the united states economy combined with improved business demand led to the strong revpar growth throughout the lodging industry 
in  forecasts for the lodging industry continue to be favorable as us gross domestic product gdp is forecast to continue to expand 
we feel there will be some final unwinding of suppressed business travel from the low levels experienced in and that will generate increases in business demand 
results of operations revpar is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations 
revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate adr charged and the average daily occupancy achieved

although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues  it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels 
we also use revpar to compare the results of our hotels between periods and to analyze results of our comparable hotels 
increases in revpar attributable to increases in occupancy are generally accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs 
increases in revpar attributable to increases in adr are accompanied by increases in limited categories of operating costs  such as management fees and franchise fees

in general  we are focused exclusively on investing in the hospitality industry across all segments  including direct hotel investments  first mortgages  mezzanine loans  and sale leaseback transactions 
we intend to acquire and  in the appropriate market conditions  develop additional hotels and provide structured financings to owners of lodging properties 
we may incur indebtedness to fund any such acquisitions  developments  or financings 
we may also incur indebtedness to meet distribution requirements imposed on reits under the internal revenue code to the extent that working capital and cash flow from our investments are insufficient to make the required distributions 
however  no assurances can be given that we will obtain additional financings or  if we do  what the amount and terms will be 
our failure to obtain future financing under favorable terms could adversely impact our ability to execute on our business strategy 
in addition  we may selectively pursue mortgage financing on individual properties and our mortgage investments 
we will acquire or develop additional hotels and invest in structured financings only as suitable opportunities arise  and we will not undertake such investments unless adequate sources of financing are available 
funds for future hotel related investments are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from future borrowings under a credit facility or other borrowings or from the proceeds of additional issuances of common stock  preferred stock  or other securities 
however  other than the aforementioned acquisitions and those mentioned in subsequent events discussion below  we have no formal commitment or understanding to invest in additional assets  and there can be no assurance that we will successfully make additional investments 
our existing hotels are located in developed areas that contain competing hotel properties 
the future occupancy  adr  and revpar of any individual hotel could be materially and adversely affected by an increase in the number or quality of the competitive hotel properties in its market area 
competition could also affect the quality and quantity of future investment opportunities 
inflation we rely entirely on the performance of our properties and the ability of the properties managers to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation 
hotel operators can generally increase room rates rather quickly  
table of contents but competitive pressures may limit their ability to raise rates faster than inflation 
our general and administrative costs  such as real estate and personal property taxes  property and casualty insurance  and utilities  are subject to inflation as well 
seasonality our properties operations historically have been seasonal as certain properties maintain higher occupancy rates during the summer months 
this seasonality pattern can be expected to cause fluctuations in our quarterly lease revenue under the percentage leases 
we anticipate that our cash flow from the operation of the properties will be sufficient to enable us to make quarterly distributions to maintain our reit status 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in lease revenue  we expect to utilize other cash on hand or borrowings to make required distributions 
however  we cannot make any assurances that we will make distributions in the future 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
investment in hotel properties the initial six hotel properties are stated at the predecessor s historical cost  net of any impairment charges  plus an approximate million minority interest partial step up recorded upon formation of the company on august   related to the acquisition of minority interest from unaffiliated parties associated with four of the initial properties 
hotel properties acquired subsequent to the company s formation are stated at cost 
all improvements and additions which extend the useful life of hotel properties are capitalized 
impairment of investment in hotel properties hotel properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the hotel properties may not be recoverable 
the company tests for impairment in several situations  including when current or projected cash flows are less than historical cash flows  when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life  and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a hotel s net book value may not be recoverable 
in the evaluation of the impairment of hotel properties  the company makes many assumptions and estimates  including projected cash flows  holding period  expected useful life  future capital expenditures  and fair values  including consideration of capitalization rates  discount rates  and comparable selling prices 
to date  no such impairment charges have been recognized 
if an asset were deemed to be impaired  the company would record an impairment charge for the amount that the property s net book value exceeds its fair value 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of the company s assets  while amortization expense for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
presently  hotel properties are depreciated using the straight line method over lives which range from to years for buildings and improvements and to years for furniture  fixtures  and equipment 
while the company believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss as well as the gain or loss on the potential sale of any of the company s hotels 
notes receivable the company provides mezzanine and first mortgage financing in the form of loans 
loans receivable are recorded at cost  adjusted for net origination fees and costs 
premiums  discounts  and net origination fees are amortized or accreted as an adjustment to interest income using the effective interest method 
loans receivable are reviewed for potential impairment at each balance sheet date 
a loan receivable 
table of contents is considered impaired when  based on current information  it becomes probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan s contractual terms 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured by comparing the recorded amount of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows or fair value of collateral 
if a loan were deemed to be impaired  the company would record a reserve for loan losses through a charge to income for any shortfall 
to date  no such impairment charges have been recognized 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised fin no 
 variable interest entities  as defined  are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the variable interest entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
the company s mezzanine and first mortgage loans receivable are each secured by various hotel properties or partnership interests in hotel properties and are subordinate to primary loans related to the secured hotels 
all of these loans receivable are considered to be variable interests in the entities that own the related hotels  which are variable interest entities 
however  the company is not considered to be the primary beneficiary of these hotel properties as a result of holding these loans 
therefore  the company does not consolidate the hotels for which it has provided financing 
interests in entities acquired or created in the future will be evaluated based on fin no 
criteria  and such entities will be consolidated  if required 
the analysis utilized by the company in evaluating fin no 
criteria involves considerable management judgment and assumptions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our debt instruments that bear interest at variable rates that fluctuate with market interest rates 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates 
as of december   our million debt portfolio consisted of approximately million of outstanding variable rate debt and approximately million of outstanding of fixed rate debt  with interest rates ranging from to 
as discussed below  million of the variable rate debt was converted to fixed rate debt via an interest rate swap 
on september   we purchased a libor interest rate cap with a million notional amount to limit our exposure to rising interest rates on million of our floating rate debt 
to partially offset the cost of the purchased cap  we sold a libor interest rate cap with a million notional amount with identical terms to the purchased cap 
hence  we own a net interest rate cap with a million notional amount 
both the purchased and sold interest rate caps mature october  on september   we entered into a million stair stepped interest rate swap agreement  at an average interest rate of over the term of the swap  which matures march  the interest rate swap effectively converts the interest payments on million of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate 
our objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  we primarily use interest rate swaps and caps as part of our cash flow hedging strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
purchased interest rate caps provide us with interest rate protection above the strike rate on the cap and result in us receiving interest payments when rates are above the cap strike 
for the year ended december   the impact to our results of operations of a one point change in interest rate on the outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of december   net of the million notional amount protected by an interest rate swap as of that date  would be approximately million 
as of december   we owned approximately million of variable rate loans receivable 
for the year ended december   the impact to our results of operations of a one point change in interest rate on the outstanding balance of variable rate loans receivable as of december   would be approximately  we had no other outstanding loans receivable as of december  as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding variable rate debt 
the impact to our annual results of operations of a one point change in interest rate on the outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of december   would be approximately  we also had approximately million of fixed rate debt outstanding at december  we had no other outstanding debt as of december  
table of contents as of december   we owned a million mezzanine variable rate loan receivable 
the impact to our annual results of operations of a one point change in interest rate on the outstanding balance of variable rate loans receivable as of december   would be approximately  we had no other outstanding loans receivable as of december  the above amounts were determined based on the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost  and assume no changes in our capital structure 
as the information presented above includes only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
hence  the information represented herein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the hedging strategies at the time  and the related interest rates
