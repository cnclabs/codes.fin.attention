item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information contains certain forward looking statements that anticipate future trends or events 
these statements are based on certain assumptions that may prove to be erroneous and are subject to certain risks including but not limited to the uncertainties of the company s new product introductions  the risks of increased competition and technological change in the company s industries and other factors detailed in the company s sec filings 
accordingly  actual results may differ  possibly materially  from the predictions contained herein 
results of operations overview balancer segment sales focus throughout the world on end users  rebuilders and original equipment manufacturers of grinding machines with the target geographic markets in north america  asia and europe 
beginning in march  improving economic conditions in north america resulted in increased sales in that geographic market 
sales people  representatives and distributors throughout these geographic areas spend a large amount of time with targeted customers 
they are finding many of the customers in the automotive  bearing and aircraft industries refer to improved economic conditions and its impact on the machine tool industry in north america as the reason for their increased orders 
while those customers are optimistic regarding short term demand for balancer products  they remain uncertain as to the strength and duration of current business conditions in north america for their products which incorporate the balancer segment product line 
market demand in asia for the balancer segment products remains strong  although with increasing competition there was a small decline in sales volumes in fiscal when compared to fiscal as with the north american market  the duration of the strong demand in asia cannot be forecasted with any certainty 
despite a soft european market  there have been some increases in the number of units sold into that geographic market 
this is attributed to more focused and aggressive sales and marketing techniques by the european based sales and marketing staff 
however  until the markets for the products of the company improve in europe  there is no guarantee these more aggressive efforts will continue to generate increasing unit sales 
the measurement segment product line consists of both laser light scatter and dimensional sizing products 
the business operations and prospects for these two product lines are summarized as follows laser light scatter products for disk drive and silicon wafer manufacturers the primary target markets for measurement products have been disk drive and silicon wafer manufacturers and companies and organizations involved in research efforts 
management and the sales staff monitor industry publications and public financial information in order to judge the potential demand for products by the targeted industries 
over the past several months  this information has indicated improving demand for and sales of the products of those industries 
also  frequent discussions with customers have confirmed the information presented in the public information 
sales to customers in these industries can be very cyclical and therefore the impact of this recovery on sales to the company s laser light scatter products is unknown at this time  although sales personnel have seen increasing interest and inquiries regarding the company s products 
laser light scatter products for research organizations the company continues to receive inquiries for these products and provide quotes to interested parties 
however  in the current fiscal year  no sales of these products have been realized 
dimensional sizing products these products are marketed and sold into a wide array of industries 
in fiscal management built a sales distribution network covering all fifty states 
as a result of this action  the company experienced increasing interest and sales in these products in the most recent fiscal period when compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year 
during the quarter ended august   management consolidated the operations related to these products which had been located in menlo park  california into the measurement segment operations in portland  oregon 
this action reduced the engineering and administrative staff by four people and  beginning in november  reduced monthly rental costs by  as a result of the physical relocation of the business in the fiscal quarter ended august   operations were suspended for a period of time and served to dampen the sales volume of dimensional sizing products in that period 
the relocation was completed as of august  since relocation to portland  sales of these products were  and  in fiscal and respectively 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
for sales to all customers  including manufacturer representatives  distributors or their third party customers  these criteria are met at the time product is shipped 
when other significant obligations remain after products are delivered  revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled 
accounts receivable the company maintains credit limits for all customers that are developed based upon several factors  including but not limited to payment history  published credit reports and use of credit references 
on a monthly basis  management performs various analyses to evaluate accounts receivable balances to ensure recorded amounts reflect estimated net realizable value 
this review includes accounts receivable agings  other operating trends and relevant business conditions  including general economic factors  as they relate to the company s domestic and international customers 
if these analyses lead management to the conclusion that potential significant accounts are uncollectible  a reserve is provided 
inventories these assets are stated at the lower of cost or market on an average cost basis 
each fiscal quarter  management utilizes various analyses based on sales forecasts  historical sales and inventory levels to ensure the current carrying value of inventory accurately reflects current and expected requirements within a reasonable timeframe 
long term deferred tax asset the company applies the asset and liability method in recording income taxes  under which deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined  based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using currently enacted tax rates and laws 
additionally  deferred tax assets are evaluated and a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in fiscal management concluded future operations would produce sufficient earnings so that a portion of this asset could be used in future periods to reduce federal and state tax liabilities 
as a result  the valuation reserve for this asset was reduced as of may  to reflect the amount of the asset management expects to utilize in future fiscal periods 
management continues to review the level of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
intangible assets there is a periodic review of intangible and other long lived assets for impairment 
this review consists of the analysis of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is determined by comparing the forecasted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate  based on management s best estimates using the appropriate assumptions and projections at the time  to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the carrying value is determined to be in excess of future operating cash flows  the asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
as of may   management does not believe impairment  as defined above  exists

the increase in north america is attributed to stronger economic conditions in fiscal compared to fiscal and therefore increased customer demand  resulting in higher unit sales 
the increase in europe is attributed to improving economic conditions and more aggressive sales efforts by the european based sales staff  again resulting in higher unit sales 
the decrease in asia is attributed to increased competition in a growing geographic market 
worldwide sales of balancer products in fiscal increased from fiscal as sales to the north american and asian markets increased by and respectively  while they decreased in the european market by 
the increase in north america was attributed to improving economic conditions and therefore increased customer demand while the increase in asia was attributed to continued strong economic conditions 
the decrease in europe was attributed to ongoing economic weakness in the targeted customer markets 
worldwide sales of measurement products in fiscal increased from fiscal as sales of the company s surface measurement products increased by and dimensional sizing products increased by 
the sales of surface measurement products increased as they included more unit sales of large value laser light scatter products than in the same fiscal period in the prior year 
the increase in the dimensional sizing products was due to increasing unit sales which were directly attributed to the expanding sales and marketing efforts by the company s sales staff that is devoted exclusively to the sale of these products 
total sales of measurement products in fiscal were comparable to those experienced in fiscal  although sales levels of the company s surface measurement products increased by while sales of the company s dimensional sizing products decreased by 
sales of surface measurement products increased as there were larger sales of large value laser light scatter products in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in the dimensional sizing products were due to lower unit sales which are directly attributed to the closure in operations during the relocation of the production operations for those products into the portland  oregon facility in the first two fiscal quarters of fiscal cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  for the balancer segment in fiscal increased slightly from those in fiscal this occurred as some vendors increased the unit costs of the various raw materials the company purchases and those increases were not passed along to the customers of the company 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  for the balancer segment decreased in fiscal when compared to fiscal the decline can be largely attributed to the geographic sales mix 
sales to the north american markets were a higher percentage of total balancer segment sales in fiscal than they were in fiscal unit sales prices in north america are higher than they are in other geographic markets and therefore the costs on those sales are lower as a percentage of sales than in other geographic markets 
when sales to the north american market are a higher proportion of total sales  as they were in fiscal compared to fiscal  the effect is to lower cost of sales as a percentage of sales 
also  the materials costs were in higher in fiscal than in fiscal as the earlier fiscal year included a write off of  in excess inventory quantities while in fiscal no excess inventory quantities were written off 
cost of sales in the measurement segment were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower material and direct labor costs as a percentage of sales 
materials costs as a percentage of sales in the current fiscal year were compared to in the same period in the prior fiscal year 
in the prior year the company had higher materials costs than normal on a large product order 
these higher materials costs occurred because the customer cancelled the order but the materials purchased for the product were expensed as they had been ordered specifically for that project 
if the impact of the higher than normal materials costs resulting from that order is excluded from the prior year results  the materials costs as a percentage of sales would have been more in line with the current fiscal period results 
direct labor costs as a percentage of sales for the fiscal period ended may  was compared to for the fiscal period ended may  the increase in direct labor costs as a percentage of sales occurred due to the types of products produced 
cost of sales in the measurement segment increased in fiscal when compared to fiscal the primary reason for the decrease was that fiscal included a write off of excess inventory quantities of  while there were no such write offs in fiscal this decrease was offset by overall lower costs of sales as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the mix of products sold 
the increase in operating expenses between fiscal and occurred primarily due to the higher levels of sales 
the decrease in operating expenses between fiscal and occurred primarily due to a decrease in payroll costs at the acuity research subsidiary 
the costs at acuity decreased due to the reduction in engineering and administration staff that occurred due to the consolidation of acuity operations in portland during the quarter ended august  net sales outside north america accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal some foreign customers purchase in their own country s currencies  thereby imposing on the company a currency risk 
of total sales in fiscal  and  approximately  and were denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
to date  currency fluctuations have had minimal impact on sales 
however  significant variations in the value of the us dollar  relative to currencies of countries in which the company has significant competitors  can impact future sales 
the company does not engage in currency hedging 
in addition  the longer payment cycles of international sales can have a negative impact on liquidity 
the company believes international sales will continue to grow in future periods 
the net income for fiscal of  per fully diluted share compared to net income of  per fully diluted share and net losses of  per share in fiscal and respectively 
net income in fiscal included two significant items  a foreign exchange loss of  which was incurred due to the closure of the german subsidiary schmitt europa  gmbh and  income tax benefit due to the reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the net loss in fiscal included three significant items a  non operating charge for a write down of the company s long term investment in air packaging technologies  inc   in write downs of excess inventory quantities and an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of  a substantial portion of the company s revenues are derived from sales to end users through selling agents 
the company is dependent on the sales activities of its selling agents  and there can be no assurance these agents will continue to be successful in their efforts to market the company s products 
the company enjoys substantial repeat business from a broad base of customers  but there is no assurance these customers will continue to buy the company s products 
for fiscal years  or  sales to a single customer did not exceed of total revenues 
the company operates in highly competitive industries characterized by increasingly rapid technological changes 
the company s competitive advantage and future success are therefore dependent on its ability to develop new products  qualify these new products with its customers  successfully introduce these products to the marketplace on a timely basis  commence production to meet customer demands and develop new markets in the industries for its products and services 
the successful introduction of new technology and products is increasingly complex 
if the company is unable  for whatever reason  to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  its results of operations could be adversely impacted 
liquidity and capital resources the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to to at may  compared to to at may  as of may  the company had  in cash compared to  at may  during the year ended may   cash provided from operating activities amounted to  with the changes described as follows the net income for the year ended may  of  and three non cash items depreciation and amortization of  an increase in the deferred tax asset of  and the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts of  accounts receivable used cash as the balance increased by  exclusive of the change in the allowance for doubtful accounts to a may  balance of  compared to  at may  at may    in accounts receivable were considered as doubtful of collection and therefore a reserve in that amount has been provided for 
the company generally experiences a payment cycle of days on invoices  depending on the geographic market 
management believes its credit and collection policies are effective and appropriate for the marketplace 
there can be no assurance that the company s collection procedures will continue to be successful  particularly with current economic conditions 
inventories increased  to a may  balance of  compared to  at may  the company maintains levels of inventory sufficient to satisfy normal customer demands plus an increasing short term delivery requirement for a majority of its balancer products 
management believes its ability to provide prompt delivery gives it a competitive advantage for certain sales 
prepaid expenses decreased by  to a may  balance of  compared to  at may  due to the amortization of several items including prepaid trade show costs  professional fees and various business and life insurance costs 
trade accounts payable decreased by  to a may  balance of  compared to  at may  with the increase due to increased purchasing activities in both the balancer and measurement segments 
other accrued liabilities including commission  payroll items and other accrued expenses increased by  to a may  balance of  compared to  at may  during the year ended may   net cash used in investing activities was  consisting of net additions to property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to  which consists of repayments on capitalized obligations of  and common stock issued to employees and directors exercising stock options for  the following summarizes contractual obligations at may  and the effect on future liquidity and cash flows years ending may  capital lease and purchase contract operating leases total contractual obligations thereafter total part of the acquisition of sms in fiscal resulted in the acquisition of a tax net operating loss of approximately million  which is available to offset domestic earnings through the year as of may   approximately  of the losses from sms remain 
management has responded to business challenges over the past few years by reducing operating expenses  developing new products and attempting to penetrate new markets for the company s products 
as a result of these efforts  management believes its cash flows from operations  cash position and operating line of credit will provide adequate funds on both a short term and long term basis to cover currently foreseeable debt payments  lease commitments and payments under existing and anticipated supplier agreements 
management believes that such cash flow without the raising of external funds is sufficient to finance current operations  projected capital expenditures  anticipated long term sales agreements and other expansion related contingencies during fiscal however  in the event the company fails to achieve its operating and financial goals for fiscal  management may be required to take certain actions to finance operations in that time period 
these actions could include  but are not limited to  implementation of cost cutting measures  borrowings from credit facilities or entering into additional borrowing arrangements collateralized by fixed assets 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company did not have any derivative financial instruments as of may  however  the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in the market risk of its marketable securities 
the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us and european interest rates 
therefore  changes in us and european interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as interest paid on debt 
the company does have a line of credit but does not have an outstanding balance as of may  also there is no other debt whose interest rates are based on variable rates that may fluctuate over time based on economic changes in the environment 
therefore  at this time  the company is not subject to interest rate risk if market interest rates fluctuate and does not expect any change in the interest rates to have a material effect on the company s results from operations 
foreign currency risk the company operates a subsidiary in the united kingdom 
therefore  the company s business and financial condition is sensitive to currency exchange rates or any other restrictions imposed on their currencies 
for the years ended may   and  results of operations included gains losses on foreign currency translation of   and  respectively 
the foreign exchange loss in fiscal was directly attributable to the closure  liquidation and pending dissolution of the company s german subsidiary  schmitt europa  gmbh 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal management chose to terminate the only two employees in that country  eliminating the need for a separate german company 
as there will be no future activity in that subsidiary and it will be dissolved early in fiscal  the accumulated foreign exchange loss  included in other comprehensive income on the balance sheet in prior periods  was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal the foreign exchange gains in fiscal and are primarily attributable to company s united kingdom subsidiary  schmitt europe  ltd 
sel and the majority of those gains occur from payments to the parent company for product purchased 
sel purchases the majority of its products from the parent company with the billings denominated in us dollars 
the asset and liability at sel are converted to uk currency using the foreign exchange rates at the time of the transaction 
when those amounts are repaid to the parent company  payment is in us currency and therefore gains or losses are recognized at the time the liability is converted to us dollars 
in the case of fiscal and  the weakening us dollar compared to british pounds sterling produced the foreign exchange gains at sel
