c included within video customers are those in commercial and multi dwelling structures  which are calculated on an equivalent bulk unit ebu basis 
ebu is calculated for a system by dividing the bulk price charged to accounts in an area by the most prevalent price charged to non bulk residential customers in that market for the comparable tier of service 
the ebu method of estimating analog video customers is consistent with the methodology used in determining costs paid to programmers and has been consistently applied year over year 
as we increase our effective analog prices to residential customers without a corresponding increase in the prices charged to commercial service or multi dwelling customers  our ebu count will decline even if there is no real loss in commercial service or multi dwelling customers

for the years ending december   and  we had advertising revenues from vendors of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
these revenues resulted from purchases at market rates pursuant to binding agreements 
pricing of our products and services our revenues are derived principally from the monthly fees our customers pay for the services we offer 
a one time installation fee  which is sometimes waived or discounted during certain promotional periods  is charged to new customers 
the prices we charge vary based on the level of service the customer chooses and the geographic market 
most of our pricing is reviewed and adjusted on an annual basis 
in accordance with the federal communications commission s rules  the prices we charge for cable related equipment  such as set top terminals and remote control devices  and for installation services are based on actual costs plus a permitted rate of return

there is no assurance that these customers will remain as customers when the period of free service expires 
our network technology the following table sets forth the technological capacity of our systems as of december  based on a percentage of homes passed megahertz less than to two way two way megahertz megahertz megahertz megahertz capability enabled 
table of contents as a result of the upgrade of our systems over the past several years  approximately of our homes passed are served by systems that have bandwidth of megahertz or greater 
this bandwidth capacity enables us to offer digital television  high speed data services and other advanced services 
it also enables us to offer up to analog channels  and even more channels when our bandwidth is used for digital signal transmissions 
our increased bandwidth also permits two way communication for internet access  interactive services  and potentially  telephony services 
as part of our systems upgrade and partly as a result of system sales  we reduced the number of headends that serve our customers from  at january  to at december  because headends are the control centers of a cable system  where incoming signals are amplified  converted  processed and combined for transmission to the customer  reducing the number of headends reduces related equipment  service personnel and maintenance expenditures 
we believe that the headend consolidation  together with our other upgrades  allows us to provide enhanced picture quality and greater system reliability 
as a result of the upgrade  approximately of our customers were served by headends serving at least  customers as of december  as of december   our cable systems consisted of approximately  strand miles  including approximately  strand miles of fiber optic cable  passing approximately million households and served approximately million customers 
we adopted the hybrid fiber coaxial cable hfc architecture as the standard for our systems upgrades 
hfc architecture combines the use of fiber optic cable with coaxial cable 
fiber optic cable is a communication medium that uses glass fibers to transmit signals over long distances with minimum signal loss or distortion 
fiber optic cable has excellent broadband frequency characteristics  noise immunity and physical durability and can carry hundreds of video  data and voice channels over extended distances 
coaxial cable is less expensive and requires a more extensive signal amplification in order to obtain the desired transmission levels for delivering channels 
in most systems  we deliver our signals via fiber optic cable from the headend to a group of nodes  and use coaxial cable to deliver the signal from individual nodes to the homes passed served by that node 
our system design enables a maximum of homes passed to be served by a single node 
currently  our average node serves approximately homes passed 
our system design provides for six strands of fiber to each node  with two strands activated and four strands reserved for spares and future services 
we believe that this hybrid network design provides high capacity and superior signal quality 
the design also provides reserve capacity for the addition of future services 
the primary advantages of hfc architecture over traditional coaxial only cable networks include increased bandwidth capacity  for more channels and other services  dedicated bandwidth for two way services  which avoids reverse signal interference problems that can occur with two way communication capability  and improved picture quality and service reliability 
we currently maintain a national network operations center to monitor our data networks and to further our strategy of providing high quality service 
centralized monitoring is increasingly important as we increase the number of high speed data customers utilizing two way high speed data service 
our local dispatch centers focus primarily on monitoring the hfc plant 
management of our systems many of the functions associated with our financial management are centralized  including accounting  billing  finance and acquisitions  payroll  accounts payable and benefit administration  information system design and support  internal audit  purchasing  marketing  programming contract administration and internet service  network and circuits administration 
we operate with four divisions 
each division is supported by operational  financial  marketing and engineering functions 
customer care we have customer service locations  including divisional contact centers that serve approximately of our customers 
our customer care centers are managed divisionally by a vice president of customer care and are 
table of contents supported by a corporate care team  which oversees and supports deployment and execution of care strategies and initiatives on a company wide basis 
this reflects a substantial consolidation of our customer care function from over service centers in we believe that this consolidation will allow us to improve the consistency of our service delivery and customer satisfaction by reducing or eliminating the logistical challenges and poor economies of scale inherent in maintaining and supervising a larger number of separately managed service centers 
specifically  through this consolidation  we are now able to service our customers hours a day  seven days a week and utilize technologically advanced equipment that we believe enhances interactions with our customers through more intelligent call routing  data management  and forecasting and scheduling capabilities 
we believe this consolidation also allows us to more effectively provide our customer care specialists with ongoing training intended to improve complaint resolution  equipment troubleshooting  sales of new and additional services  and customer retention 
we believe that  despite our consolidation  we have not yet sufficiently improved in the area of customer care  and that this lack of improvement has in part led to a continued net loss of customers 
accordingly  we have begun an internal operational improvement initiative aimed at helping us gain new customers and retain existing customers  which is focused on customer care  among other areas 
we intend to increase our efforts to focus management attention on instilling a customer service oriented culture throughout the company and to give those areas of our operations increased priority of resources for staffing levels  training budgets and financial incentives for employee performance in those areas 
in a further effort to better serve our customers  we have also entered into outsource partnership agreements with two key outsource providers 
we believe the establishment of these relationships expands our ability to achieve our service objectives and increases our ability to support marketing activities by providing additional capacity available to support customer inquiries 
we also utilize our website to enhance customer care by enabling customers to view and pay their bills online  obtain useful information and perform various equipment troubleshooting procedures 
sales and marketing in the third quarter of  charter shifted primary responsibility for implementing sales and marketing strategies to the divisional and system level  with a single corporate team to ensure compliance with guidelines established by the corporate marketing department designed to promote national branding consistency 
our marketing infrastructure is intended to promote interaction  information flow and sharing of best practices between our corporate office and our field offices  which make strategic decisions as to when and how marketing programs will be implemented 
due to our focus in on certain other operational matters and due to certain financial constraints  we reduced spending in on marketing our products and services 
marketing expenditures increased for the year ended december  to million 
we expect to increase our spending on marketing in we monitor government regulation  customer perception  competition  pricing and product preferences  among other factors  to increase our responsiveness to our customers 
our coordinated marketing strategies include door to door solicitation  telemarketing  media advertising  e marketing  direct mail solicitation and retail locations 
in  we increased our focus on marketing and selling our services through consumer electronics retailers and other retailers that sell televisions or cable modems 
in january  we introduced the first national branding campaign in charter s history 
the get hooked branding initiative was a key focal point of our national marketing campaigns in with the aim of promoting deeper market penetration and increased revenue per customer 
in  our corporate team produced eight national get hooked marketing campaigns designed to promote awareness and loyalty among existing customers and attract new customers  announce the availability of our advanced services as we roll them out in our systems  promote our advanced services such as dvr  high definition television  telephony  vod and svod with the goal that our customers will view their cable connection as one stop shopping for video  voice  high speed data and interactive services  and promote our bundling of digital video and high speed data services and pricing strategies 
programming general we believe that offering a wide variety of programming is an important factor that influences a customer s decision to subscribe to and retain our cable services 
we rely on market research  customer demographics and local programming preferences to determine channel offerings in each of our markets 
we obtain basic and premium 
table of contents programming from a number of suppliers  usually pursuant to a written contract 
our programming contracts generally continue for a fixed period of time  usually from three to ten years  and are subject to negotiated renewal 
some program suppliers offer financial incentives to support the launch of a channel and ongoing marketing support or launch fees 
we also negotiate volume discount pricing structures 
programming costs are usually payable each month based on calculations performed by us and are subject to adjustment based on the results of periodic audits by the programmers 
costs programming tends to be made available to us for a license fee  which is generally paid based on the number of customers to whom we make such programming available 
such license fees may include volume discounts available for higher numbers of customers  as well as discounts for channel placement or service penetration 
some channels are available without cost to us for a limited period of time  after which we pay for the programming 
for home shopping channels  we receive a percentage of the amount our customers spend on home shopping purchases 
our cable programming costs have increased  in every year we have operated  in excess of customary inflationary and cost of living type increases 
we expect them to continue to increase due to a variety of factors  including annual increases imposed by programmers and additional programming being provided to customers as a result of system rebuilds and bandwidth reallocation  both of which increase channel capacity 
in particular  sports programming costs have increased significantly over the past several years 
in addition  contracts to purchase sports programming sometimes contain built in cost increases for programming added during the term of the contract 
historically  we have absorbed increased programming costs in large part through increased prices to our customers 
however  with the impact of competition and other marketplace factors  there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so 
in order to maintain or mitigate reductions of margins despite increasing programming costs  we plan to continue to migrate certain program services from our analog level of service to our digital tiers 
as we migrate our programming to our digital tier packages  certain programming that was previously available to all of our customers via an analog signal  may be part of an elective digital tier package 
as a result  the customer base upon which we pay programming fees will proportionately decrease  and the overall expense for providing that service would likewise decrease 
reductions in the size of certain programming customer bases may result in the loss of specific volume discount benefits 
as measured by programming costs  and excluding premium services substantially all of which were renegotiated and renewed in  as of december  approximately of our current programming contracts were expired  and approximately another are scheduled to expire by the end of we plan to seek to renegotiate the terms of our agreements with certain programmers as these agreements come due for renewal 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms 
to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms that we believe are reasonable  we may be forced to remove such programming channels from our line up  which could result in a further loss of customers 
in addition  our inability to fully pass these programming cost increases on to our customers would have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margins 
franchises as of december   our systems operated pursuant to a total of approximately  franchises  permits and similar authorizations issued by local and state governmental authorities 
each franchise is awarded by a governmental authority and such governmental authority often must approve a transfer to another party 
most franchises are subject to termination proceedings in the event of a material breach 
in addition  most franchises require us to pay the granting authority a franchise fee of up to of revenues as defined in the various agreements  which is the maximum amount that may be charged under the applicable federal law 
we are entitled to and generally do pass this fee through to the customer 
prior to the scheduled expiration of most franchises  we initiate renewal proceedings with the granting authorities 
this process usually takes three years but can take a longer period of time 
the communications act provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting authorities may not unreasonably withhold renewals 
in 
table of contents connection with the franchise renewal process  many governmental authorities require the cable operator to make certain commitments 
historically we have been able to renew our franchises without incurring significant costs  although any particular franchise may not be renewed on commercially favorable terms or otherwise 
our failure to obtain renewals of our franchises  especially those in the major metropolitan areas where we have the most customers  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or our liquidity  including our ability to comply with our debt covenants 
approximately of our franchises  covering approximately of our analog video customers were expired at december  approximately of additional franchises  covering approximately of additional analog video customers will expire on or before december   if not renewed prior to expiration 
we expect to renew substantially all of these franchises 
under the telecommunications act of the telecom act  state and local authorities are prohibited from limiting  restricting or conditioning the provision of telecommunications services 
they may  however  impose competitively neutral requirements and manage the public rights of way 
granting authorities may not require a cable operator to provide telecommunications services or facilities  other than institutional networks  as a condition of an initial franchise grant  a franchise renewal  or a franchise transfer 
the telecom act also limits franchise fees to an operator s cable related revenues and clarifies that they do not apply to revenues that a cable operator derives from providing new telecommunications services 
in a march decision  the federal communications commission fcc held that revenue derived from the provision of cable modem service should not be added to franchise fee payments already limited by federal law to of traditional cable service revenue 
the same decision tentatively limited local franchising authority regulation of cable modem service 
on october   the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit vacated in part the fcc s march decision and remanded for further proceedings 
the ninth circuit affirmed the portion of the fcc s march decision holding that cable modem service is not a cable service 
although the ninth circuit s decision should not subject cable operators to additional cable franchise fee requirements for the provision of cable modem service  it could possibly result in other telecommunications regulation 
competition we face competition in the areas of price  service offerings  and service reliability 
we compete with other providers of television signals and other sources of home entertainment 
in addition  as we continue to expand into additional services such as high speed internet access and telephony  we face competition from other providers of each type of service 
we operate in a very competitive business environment  which can adversely affect our business and operations 
in terms of competition for customers  we view ourselves as a member of the broadband communications industry  which encompasses multi channel video for television and related broadband services  such as high speed data and other interactive video services 
in the broadband industry  our principal competitor for video services throughout our territory is direct broadcast satellite dbs  and in markets where it is available  our principal competitor for data services is digital subscriber line dsl 
we do not consider other cable operators to be significant one on one competitors in the market overall  as traditional overbuilds are infrequent and spotty geographically although in a particular market  a cable operator overbuilder would likely be a significant competitor at the local level 
as of december   we are aware of traditional overbuild situations in service areas covering approximately of our total homes passed and potential overbuilds in areas servicing approximately of our total homes passed 
although cable operators tend not to be direct competitors for customers  their relative size may affect the competitive landscape in terms of how a cable company competes against non cable competitors in the market place as well as in relationships with vendors who deal with cable operators 
for example  a larger cable operator might have better access to and pricing for the multiple types of services cable companies offer 
also  a larger entity might have different access to financial resources and acquisition opportunities 
our key competitors include dbs direct broadcast satellite is a significant competitor to cable systems 
the dbs industry has grown rapidly over the last several years  far exceeding the growth rate of the cable television industry  and now serves more than million subscribers nationwide 
dbs service allows the subscriber to receive video services directly via satellite using a relatively small dish antenna 
consistent with increasing consolidation in the communications industry  news corp  one of the world s largest media companies  acquired a controlling interest in directv  inc directv in  the largest domestic dbs company 
this business combination could further strengthen 
table of contents directv s competitive posture  particularly through favorable programming arrangements with various news corp 
affiliates and subsidiaries  such as the fox television network 
additionally  echostar and directv both have entered into joint marketing agreements with major telecommunications companies to offer bundled packages combining phone service  dsl and dbs services 
video compression technology and high powered satellites allow dbs providers to offer more than digital channels from a single transponder satellite  thereby surpassing the typical analog cable system 
in  major dbs competitors offered a greater variety of channel packages  and were especially competitive at the lower end pricing  such as a monthly price of approximately for channels compared to approximately for the closest comparable package in most of our markets 
in addition  while we continue to believe that the initial investment by a dbs customer exceeds that of a cable customer  the initial equipment cost for dbs has decreased substantially  as the dbs providers have aggressively marketed offers to new customers of incentives for discounted or free equipment  installation and multiple units 
dbs providers are able to offer service nationwide and are able to establish a national image and branding with standardized offerings  which together with their ability to avoid franchise fees of up to of revenues and property tax  leads to greater efficiencies and lower costs in the lower tiers of service 
however  we believe that most consumers continue to prefer our stronger local presence in our markets 
we believe that cable delivered vod and svod service are superior to dbs service because cable headends can store thousands of titles which customers can access and control independently  whereas dbs technology can only make available a much smaller number of titles with dvr like customer control 
we also believe that our higher tier products  particularly our bundled premium packages  are price competitive with dbs packages and that many consumers prefer our ability to economically bundle video packages with data packages 
further  cable providers have the potential in some areas to provide a more complete whole house communications package when combining video  high speed data and voice 
we believe that this  combined with the introduction of more new products that dbs cannot offer local high definition television and local interactive television differentiates us from dbs competitors and could enable us to win back some of our former customers who migrated to satellite 
recent joint marketing arrangements between dbs providers and telecommunications carriers allow similar bundling of services in certain areas 
dbs companies historically were prohibited from retransmitting popular local broadcast programming 
however  a change to the copyright laws in  which was continued in  eliminated this legal impediment 
as a result  dbs companies now may retransmit such programming  once they have secured retransmission consent from the popular broadcast stations they wish to carry  and honor mandatory carriage obligations of less popular broadcast stations in the same television markets 
in response to the legislation  directv and echostar have been carrying the major network stations in many of the nation s television markets 
dbs  however  is limited in the local programming it can provide because of the current capacity limitations of satellite technology 
dbs companies do not offer local broadcast programming in every us market  although the number of markets covered is increasing 
dbs providers have made attempts at widespread deployment of high speed internet access services via satellite but those services have been technically constrained and of limited appeal 
however  dbs providers have entered into joint marketing arrangements with telecommunications carriers allowing them to offer terrestrial dsl services in many markets 
dsl and other broadband services digital subscriber line service allows internet access to subscribers at data transmission speeds greater than those available over conventional telephone lines 
dsl service therefore is competitive with high speed internet access over cable systems 
most telephone companies which already have plant  an existing customer base  and other operational functions in place such as  billing  service personnel  etc 
offer dsl service 
dsl actively markets its service and many providers have offered promotional pricing with a one year service agreement 
the fcc has initiated a rulemaking proceeding that could materially reduce existing regulation of dsl service  essentially freeing such service from traditional telecommunications regulation 
it is also possible that federal legislation could reduce regulation of internet services offered by incumbent telephone companies 
legislative action and the fcc s decisions and policies in this area are subject to change 
we expect dsl to remain a significant competitor to our data services 
in addition  the further deployment of fiber by telephone companies into their networks will enable them to provide higher bandwidth internet service than provided over traditional dsl lines 
dsl and other forms of high speed internet access provide competition to our high speed data service 
for example  as discussed above  satellite based delivery options are in development 
in addition  local wireless internet services have recently begun to operate in many markets using available unlicensed radio spectrum 
this service option  popularly known as wi fi  offers another alternative to cable based internet access 

table of contents high speed internet access facilitates the streaming of video into homes and businesses 
as the quality and availability of video streaming over the internet improves  video streaming likely will compete with the traditional delivery of video programming services over cable systems 
it is possible that programming suppliers will consider bypassing cable operators and market their services directly to the consumer through video streaming over the internet 
we believe that pricing for residential and commercial data services on our system is generally comparable to that for similar dsl services and that some residential customers prefer our ability to bundle data services with video services 
however  dsl providers may currently be in a better position to offer data services to businesses since their networks tend to be more complete in commercial areas 
they also have the ability to bundle telephony with data services for a higher percentage of their customers  and that ability is appealing to many consumers 
joint marketing arrangements between dsl providers and dbs providers may allow some additional bundling of services 
moreover  major telephone companies  such as sbc and verizon  are now deploying fiber deep into their networks that will enable them to offer high bandwidth video services over their networks  in addition to established voice and internet services 
broadcast television cable television has long competed with broadcast television  which consists of television signals that the viewer is able to receive without charge using an off air antenna 
the extent of such competition is dependent upon the quality and quantity of broadcast signals available through off air reception compared to the services provided by the local cable system 
traditionally  cable television has provided a higher picture quality and more channel offerings than broadcast television 
however  the recent licensing of digital spectrum by the fcc will provide traditional broadcasters with the ability to deliver high definition television pictures and multiple digital quality program streams  as well as advanced digital services such as subscription video and data transmission 
traditional overbuilds cable systems are operated under non exclusive franchises granted by local authorities 
more than one cable system may legally be built in the same area 
it is possible that a franchising authority might grant a second franchise to another cable operator and that such a franchise might contain terms and conditions more favorable than those afforded us 
in addition  entities willing to establish an open video system  under which they offer unaffiliated programmers non discriminatory access to a portion of the system s cable system  may be able to avoid local franchising requirements 
well financed businesses from outside the cable industry  such as public utilities that already possess fiber optic and other transmission lines in the areas they serve  may over time become competitors 
there are a number of cities that have constructed their own cable systems  in a manner similar to city provided utility services 
there also has been interest in traditional overbuilds by private companies 
constructing a competing cable system is a capital intensive process which involves a high degree of risk 
we believe that in order to be successful  a competitor s overbuild would need to be able to serve the homes and businesses in the overbuilt area on a more cost effective basis than we can 
any such overbuild operation would require either significant access to capital or access to facilities already in place that are capable of delivering cable television programming 
as of december   we are aware of overbuild situations impacting approximately of our total homes passed and potential overbuild situations in areas servicing approximately of our total homes passed 
additional overbuild situations may occur in other systems 
in response to such overbuilds  these systems have been designated priorities for the upgrade of cable plant and the launch of new and enhanced services 
as of december   we have upgraded many of these systems to at least megahertz two way hfc architecture 
telephone companies and utilities the competitive environment has been significantly affected by technological developments and regulatory changes enacted under the telecom act  which is designed to enhance competition in the cable television and local telephone markets 
federal cross ownership restrictions historically limited entry by local telephone companies into the cable business 
the telecom act modified this cross ownership restriction  making it possible for local exchange carriers  who have considerable resources  to provide a wide variety of video services competitive with services offered by cable systems 
telephone companies can lawfully enter the cable television business  and although activity in this area historically has been quite limited  recent announcements by telephone companies indicate a growing interest in offering a video 
table of contents product 
local exchange carriers do already provide facilities for the transmission and distribution of voice and data services  including internet services  in competition with our existing or potential interactive services ventures and businesses 
in addition  major telephone companies  such as sbc and verizon  are now deploying fiber into their networks that will enable them to offer video services over their networks  in addition to established voice and internet services 
some telephone companies have begun more extensive deployment of fiber in their networks that will enable them to begin providing video services  as well as telephony and internet access service 
at least one major telephone company  sbc  plans to provide internet protocol video over its upgraded network 
sbc contends that its use of this technology should allow it to provide video service without a cable franchise as required under title vi of the communications act 
other telephone companies deploying fiber more extensively are attempting through various means to weaken or streamline the franchising requirements applicable to them 
if telephone companies are successful in avoiding or weakening the franchise and other regulatory requirements applicable to charter  their competitive posture would be enhanced 
we cannot predict the likelihood of success of the broadband services offered by our competitors or the impact on us of such competitive ventures 
the large scale entry of major telephone companies as direct competitors in the video marketplace could adversely affect the profitability and valuation of established cable systems 
as we expand our offerings to include internet access and other telecommunications services  we will be subject to competition from other telecommunications providers 
the telecommunications industry is highly competitive and includes competitors with greater financial and personnel resources  who have brand name recognition and long standing relationships with regulatory authorities and customers 
moreover  mergers  joint ventures and alliances among franchise  wireless or private cable operators  local exchange carriers and others may result in providers capable of offering cable television  internet  and telecommunications services in direct competition with us 
for example  major local exchange carriers have entered into arrangements with echostar and directv in which they will market packages combining phone service  dsl and dbs services 
additionally  we are subject to competition from utilities which possess fiber optic transmission lines capable of transmitting signals with minimal signal distortion 
utilities are also developing broadband over power line technology  which will allow the provision of internet and other broadband services to homes and offices 
private cable additional competition is posed by satellite master antenna television systems  or smatv systems  serving multiple dwelling units  or mdus  such as condominiums  apartment complexes  and private residential communities 
these private cable systems may enter into exclusive agreements with such mdus  which may preclude operators of franchise systems from serving residents of such private complexes 
private cable systems can offer both improved reception of local television stations and many of the same satellite delivered program services that are offered by cable systems 
smatv systems currently benefit from operating advantages not available to franchised cable systems  including fewer regulatory burdens and no requirement to service low density or economically depressed communities 
exemption from regulation may provide a competitive advantage to certain of our current and potential competitors 
wireless distribution cable systems also compete with wireless program distribution services such as multi channel multipoint distribution systems or wireless cable  known as mmds  which uses low power microwave frequencies to transmit television programming over the air to paying customers 
wireless distribution services generally provide many of the programming services provided by cable systems  and digital compression technology increases significantly the channel capacity of their systems 
both analog and digital mmds services  however  require unobstructed line of sight transmission paths and mmds ventures have been quite limited to date 
the fcc has completed its auction of multichannel video distribution data service mvdds licenses 
mvdds is a new terrestrial video and data fixed wireless service that the fcc hopes will spur competition in the cable and dbs industries 
regulation and legislation the following summary addresses the key regulatory and legislative developments affecting the cable industry 
cable system operations are extensively regulated by the fcc  some state governments and most local governments 
a failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial penalties 
our business can be dramatically impacted by changes to the existing regulatory framework  whether triggered by legislative  
table of contents administrative  or judicial rulings 
congress and the fcc have expressed a particular interest in increasing competition in the communications field generally and in the cable television field specifically 
the telecom act altered the regulatory structure governing the nation s communications providers 
it removed barriers to competition in both the cable television market and the local telephone market 
at the same time  the fcc has pursued spectrum licensing options designed to increase competition to the cable industry by wireless multichannel video programming distributors 
we could be materially disadvantaged in the future if we are subject to new regulations that do not equally impact our key competitors 
congress and the fcc have frequently revisited the subject of communications regulation  and they are likely to do so in the future 
in addition  franchise agreements with local governments must be periodically renewed  and new operating terms may be imposed 
future legislative  regulatory  or judicial changes could adversely affect our operations 
we can provide no assurance that the already extensive regulation of our business will not be expanded in the future 
cable rate regulation the cable industry has operated under a federal rate regulation regime for more than a decade 
the regulations currently restrict the prices that cable systems charge for basic service and associated equipment 
all other cable offerings are now universally exempt from rate regulation 
although rate regulation operates pursuant to a federal formula  local governments  commonly referred to as local franchising authorities  are primarily responsible for administering this regulation 
the majority of our local franchising authorities have never certified to regulate basic cable rates  but they retain the right to do so and order rate reductions and refunds  except in those specific communities facing effective competition 
federal law defines effective competition as existing in a variety of circumstances that historically were rarely satisfied  but are increasingly likely to be satisfied with the recent increase in dbs competition 
there have been frequent calls to impose expanded rate regulation on the cable industry 
confronted with rapidly increasing cable programming costs  it is possible that congress may adopt new constraints on the retail pricing or packaging of cable programming 
such constraints could adversely affect our operations 
the federal rate regulations also require cable operators to maintain a geographically uniform rate within each community  except in those communities facing effective competition 
as we attempt to respond to a changing marketplace with competitive pricing practices  we may face legal restraints and challenges that impede our ability to compete 
must carry retransmission consent federal law currently includes must carry regulations  which require cable systems to carry certain local broadcast television stations that the cable operator would not select voluntarily 
alternatively  popular commercial television stations can prohibit cable carriage unless the cable operator first negotiates for retransmission consent  which may be conditioned on significant payments or other concessions 
either option has a potentially adverse effect on our business 
the burden associated with must carry could increase significantly if cable systems were required to simultaneously carry both the analog and digital signals of each television station dual carriage  as the broadcast industry transitions from an analog to a digital format 
the burden could also increase significantly if cable systems become required to carry multiple program streams included within a single digital broadcast transmission multicast carriage 
additional government mandated broadcast carriage obligations could disrupt existing programming commitments  interfere with our preferred use of limited channel capacity and limit our ability to offer services that would maximize customer appeal and revenue potential 
although the fcc issued a decision on february   confirming an earlier ruling against mandating either dual carriage or multicast carriage  that decision could be appealed or congress could legislate additional carriage obligations 
access channels local franchise agreements often require cable operators to set aside certain channels for public  educational and governmental access programming 
federal law also requires cable systems to designate a portion of their channel capacity for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third parties 
increased activity in this area could further burden the channel capacity of our cable systems 

table of contents access to programming the fcc recently extended a regulation prohibiting video programmers affiliated with cable companies from favoring cable operators over new competitors and requiring such programmers to sell their satellite delivered programming to other multichannel video distributors 
this provision limits the ability of vertically integrated cable programmers to offer exclusive programming arrangements to cable companies 
dbs providers traditionally had no similar restriction on exclusive programming  but the fcc recently imposed that restriction as part of its approval of the directv news corp 
merger 
the fcc has also adopted regulations to avoid unreasonable conduct in retransmission consent negotiations between broadcasters and multichannel video programming distributors  including cable and dbs 
it imposed special conditions on the directtv news corp 
merger  including a requirement that fox affiliated broadcast stations enter into commercial arbitration for disputes over retransmission consent 
given the heightened competition and media consolidation that charter faces  it is possible that we will find it increasingly difficult to gain access to popular programming at favorable terms 
such difficulty could adversely impact our business 
ownership restrictions federal regulation of the communications field traditionally included a host of ownership restrictions  which limited the size of certain media entities and restricted their ability to enter into competing enterprises 
through a series of legislative  regulatory  and judicial actions  most of these restrictions recently were eliminated or substantially relaxed 
for example  historic restrictions on local exchange carriers offering cable service within their telephone service area  as well as those prohibiting broadcast stations from owning cable systems within their broadcast service area  no longer exist 
changes in this regulatory area  including some still subject to judicial review  could alter the business landscape in which we operate  as formidable new competitors including electric utilities  local exchange carriers  and broadcast media companies may increasingly choose to offer cable services 
the fcc previously adopted regulations precluding any cable operator from serving more than of all domestic multichannel video subscribers and from devoting more than of the activated channel capacity of any cable system to the carriage of affiliated national video programming services 
these cable ownership restrictions were invalidated by the courts  and the fcc is now considering adoption of replacement regulations 
internet service over the past several years  proposals have been advanced at the fcc and congress that would require cable operators offering internet service to provide non discriminatory access to unaffiliated internet service providers 
several local franchising authorities actually adopted mandatory open access requirements  but various federal courts rejected each of these actions  relying on different legal theories 
it remains unclear today precisely what regulatory regime ultimately will be applied to the cable industry s high speed internet service 
the fcc has ruled that cable modem service is an interstate information service  rather than a cable or telecommunications service 
this classification left cable modem service exempt from the burdens associated with traditional cable and telecommunications regulation 
the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit however  vacated in part the fcc s ruling and remanded for further proceedings 
the ninth circuit held that cable modem service is not cable service  but is part telecommunications service and part information service 
that decision has been appealed to the supreme court  which has agreed to hear the case 
the ninth circuit decision  if not overturned  could potentially result in adverse regulatory treatment  including the imposition of open access requirements on the cable industry s internet access service 
although the fcc previously suggested that regulatory forbearance of cable modem service would be appropriate  regardless of the technical classification ultimately assigned to it  a number of technology companies continue to press the fcc to subject cable modem service to certain nondiscrimination principles 
the final regulatory status of cable modem service remains uncertain 
its outcome could materially affect our business 
it could also affect whether local franchising authorities can collect franchise fees on cable modem service and whether cable systems will have any payment obligations to the federal government s universal service fund and be subject to other common carrier regulations 
as the internet has matured  it has become the subject of increasing regulatory interest 
there is now a host of federal laws affecting internet service  including the digital millennium copyright act  which affords copyright owners certain rights against us that could adversely affect our relationship with any customer accused of violating 
table of contents copyright laws 
recently enacted anti spam legislation also imposes new obligations on our operations 
the adoption of new internet regulations could adversely affect our business 
phone service the telecom act created a more favorable regulatory environment for us to provide telecommunications services 
in particular  it limited the regulatory role of local franchising authorities and established requirements ensuring that we could interconnect with other telephone companies to provide a viable service 
many implementation details remain unresolved  and there are substantial regulatory changes being considered that could impact  in both positive and negative ways  our primary telecommunications competitors and our own entry into the field of phone service 
the fcc and state regulatory authorities are considering  for example  whether common carrier regulation traditionally applied to incumbent local exchange carriers should be modified 
the fcc recently decided that alternative voice technologies  like certain types of voip  should be regulated only at the federal level  rather than by individual states 
as the fcc generally does not favor extensive regulation of such services  this decision appears to be a positive development for voip offerings 
it is unclear how these regulatory matters ultimately will be resolved and how they will affect our potential expansion into phone service 
pole attachments the communications act requires most utilities to provide cable systems with access to poles and conduits and simultaneously regulates the rates charged for this access 
the act specifies that significantly higher rates apply if the cable plant is providing telecommunications service  as well as traditional cable service 
the fcc has clarified that a cable operator s favorable pole rates are not endangered by the provision of internet access 
although that determination was upheld by the united states supreme court  a subsequent decision by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit regarding the proper regulatory classification of internet service has once again created controversy in this area 
the us supreme court has agreed to hear an appeal of that decision 
it remains possible that the underlying pole attachment formula  or its application to internet and telecommunications offerings  will be modified in a manner that substantially increases our pole attachment costs 
cable equipment the fcc has undertaken several steps to promote competition in the delivery of cable equipment and compatibility with new digital technology 
the fcc has expressly ruled that cable customers must be allowed to purchase set top terminals from third parties and established a multi year phase in during which security functions which would remain in the operator s exclusive control would be unbundled from the basic converter functions  which could then be provided by third party vendors 
the first phase of implementation has already passed 
a prohibition on cable operators leasing digital set top terminals that integrate security and basic navigation functions is currently scheduled to go into effect as of july   although the fcc may extend the deadline 
the fcc has adopted rules implementing an agreement between major cable operators and manufacturers of consumer electronics on plug and play specifications for one way digital televisions 
the rules require cable operators to provide cablecard security modules and support to customer owned digital televisions and similar devices already equipped with built in set top terminal functionality 
cable operators must support basic home recording rights and copy protection rules for digital programming content 
the fcc has adopted companion broadcast flag rules  requiring cable carriage of a code embedded in digital broadcast programming that will regulate the further use of copyright programming  although the fcc s jurisdiction to impose broadcast flag rules is currently being challenged in court 
the fcc is conducting additional related rulemakings  and the cable and consumer electronics industries are currently negotiating an agreement that would establish additional plug and play specifications for two way digital televisions 
the fcc rules are subject to challenge and inter industry negotiations are ongoing 
it is unclear how this process will develop and how it will affect our offering of cable equipment and our relationship with our customers 
other communications act provisions and fcc regulatory matters in addition to the communications act provisions and fcc regulations noted above  there are other statutory provisions and fcc regulations affecting our business 
the communications act  for example  includes cable specific privacy obligations 
the act carefully limits our ability to collect and disclose personal information 

table of contents fcc regulations include a variety of additional areas  including  among other things equal employment opportunity obligations  customer service standards  technical service standards  mandatory blackouts of certain network  syndicated and sports programming  restrictions on political advertising  restrictions on advertising in children s programming  restrictions on origination cablecasting  restrictions on carriage of lottery programming  sponsorship identification obligations  closed captioning of video programming  licensing of systems and facilities  and maintenance of public files  and emergency alert systems 
it is possible that congress or the fcc will expand or modify its regulation of cable systems in the future  and we cannot predict at this time how that might impact our business 
for example  there have been recent discussions about imposing indecency restrictions directly on cable programming 
copyright cable systems are subject to federal copyright licensing covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals 
the possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative review and could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming 
we cannot predict the outcome of this legislative activity 
moreover  the copyright office has not yet provided any guidance as to the how the compulsory copyright license should apply to newly offered digital broadcast signals 
copyright clearances for non broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations 
cable operators also must obtain music rights for locally originated programming and advertising from the major music performing rights organizations 
these licensing fees have been the source of litigation in the past  and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may arise in the future 
franchise matters cable systems generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchises granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity in order to cross public rights of way 
cable franchises generally are granted for fixed terms and in many cases include monetary penalties for noncompliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions 
the specific terms and conditions of cable franchises vary materially between jurisdictions 
each franchise generally contains provisions governing cable operations  franchise fees  system construction  maintenance  technical performance  and customer service standards 
a number of states subject cable systems to the jurisdiction of centralized state government agencies  such as public utility commissions 
although local franchising authorities have considerable discretion in establishing franchise terms  there are certain federal protections 
for example  federal law caps local franchise fees and includes renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees from arbitrary denials of renewal 
even if a franchise is renewed  however  the local franchising authority may seek to impose new and more onerous requirements as a condition of renewal 
similarly  if a local franchising authority s consent is required for the purchase or sale of a cable system  the local franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirements as a condition for providing its consent

in general  the lawsuits alleged that charter utilized misleading accounting practices and failed to disclose these accounting practices and or issued false and misleading financial statements and press releases concerning charter s operations and prospects 
the federal class actions were specifically and individually identified in public filings made by charter prior to the date of this annual report 
in october  charter filed a motion with the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation the panel to transfer the federal class actions to the eastern district of missouri 
on march   the panel transferred the six federal class actions not filed in the eastern district of missouri to that district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings with the eight federal class actions already pending there

wangberg  and charter communications  inc as noted above  charter entered into memoranda of understanding on august  setting forth agreements in principle regarding settlement of the consolidated federal class action  the state derivative action s and the federal derivative action the actions 
charter and various other defendants in those actions subsequently entered into stipulations of settlement dated as of january   setting forth a settlement of the actions in a manner consistent with the terms of the memoranda of understanding 
the stipulations of settlement  along with various supporting documentation  were filed with the court on february  the stipulations of settlement provide that  in exchange for a release of all claims by plaintiffs against charter and its former and present officers and directors named in the actions  charter will pay to the plaintiffs a combination of cash and equity collectively valued at million  which will include the fees and expenses of plaintiffs counsel 
of this amount  million will be paid in cash by charter s insurance carriers and the balance will be paid in shares of charter class a common stock having an aggregate value of million and ten year warrants to purchase shares of charter class a common stock having an aggregate warrant value of million  with such values in each case being determined pursuant to formulas set forth in the stipulations of settlement 
the warrants would have an exercise price equal to of the fair market value as defined of charter class a common stock as of the date of the entry of the order of final judgment approving the settlement 
in addition  charter expects to issue additional shares of its class a common stock to its insurance carrier having an aggregate value of million 
as part of the settlements  charter will also commit to a variety of corporate governance changes  internal practices and public disclosures  some of which have already been undertaken and none of which are inconsistent with measures charter is taking in connection with the recent conclusion of the sec investigation described below 
documents related to the settlement of the actions have now been executed and filed 
on february   the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri gave preliminary approval to the settlement of the actions 
the settlement of each of the lawsuits remains conditioned upon  among other things  final judicial approval of the settlements following notice to the class  and dismissal with prejudice of the consolidated derivative actions now pending in missouri state court  which are related to the federal derivative action 
in the event that the valuation formula in the stipulations provides for a per share value of less than  charter may elect to terminate the settlement 
in addition to the federal class actions  the state derivative action s  the new missouri state court derivative action and the federal derivative action  six putative class action lawsuits were filed against charter and certain of its then current directors and officers in the court of chancery of the state of delaware the delaware class actions 
the lawsuits were filed after the filing of a schedule d amendment by mr 
allen indicating that he was exploring a number of possible alternatives with respect to restructuring or expanding his ownership interest in charter 
we believe the plaintiffs speculated that mr 
allen might have been contemplating an unfair bid for shares of charter or some other sort of going private transaction on unfair terms and generally alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by participating in or acquiescing to such a transaction 
the lawsuits  which are substantively identical  were brought on behalf of charter s securities holders as of july   and sought unspecified damages and possible injunctive relief 
however  no such transaction by mr 
allen has been presented 
on april   orders of dismissal without prejudice were entered in each of the delaware class actions
