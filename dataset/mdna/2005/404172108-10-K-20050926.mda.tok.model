branching 
subject to certain limitations  the hola and the ots regulations permit federally chartered savings associations to establish branches in any state of the united states 
the authority to establish such branches is available a in states that expressly authorize branches of savings associations located in another state or b to an association that qualifies as a domestic building and loan association under the internal revenue code of  as amended  which imposes qualification requirements similar to those for a qualified thrift lender under the hola 
see the section below entitled qualified thrift lender test 
this authority under the hola and the ots regulations preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings associations 
community reinvestment 
under the community reinvestment act the cra  as implemented by the ots regulations  the bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with the cra 
the cra requires the ots  in connection with its examination of a savings association  to assess the bank s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the bank 
the cra also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
the bank received an outstanding cra rating in its most recent examination 
the cra regulations rate an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community needs 
in particular  the rating system focuses on three tests a a lending test  to evaluate the institution s record of making loans in its assessment areas  b an investment test  to evaluate the institution s record of investing in community development projects  affordable housing  and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses  and c a service test  to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches  atms and other offices 
the amended cra regulations also clarify how an institution s cra performance would be considered in the application process 
qualified thrift lender test 
all savings associations  including the bank  are required to meet a qualified thrift lender qtl test to avoid certain restrictions on their operations 
this test requires a savings association to have at least of its portfolio assets which consists of goodwill and other intangible assets  properties used to conduct the savings association s business and specified liquid assets not exceeding of total assets in qualified thrift investments on a monthly average for nine out of every months on a rolling basis 
at june   the bank maintained of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments  and thus met the test 
the bank has met the qtl test since its inception 
transactions with affiliates 
the bank s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by the ots regulations and by sections a and b of the federal reserve act the fra 
in general  an affiliate of the bank is any company that controls the bank or any other company that is controlled by a company that controls the bank  excluding the bank s subsidiaries other than those that are insured depository institutions 
the ots regulations prohibit a savings association a from lending to any of its affiliates that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies under section c of the bhc act and b from purchasing the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary 
section a of the fra limits the aggregate amount of transactions with any individual affiliate to of the capital and surplus of the savings association and also limits the aggregate amount of transactions with all affiliates to of the savings association s capital and surplus 
extensions of credit to affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in section a of the fra  and the purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited 
section b of the fra provides that certain transactions with affiliates  including loans and asset purchases  must be on terms and under circumstances  including credit standards  that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the association as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non affiliated companies 
in the absence of comparable transactions  such transactions may only occur under terms and circumstances  including credit standards  that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to non affiliated companies 
effective april   the federal reserve board rescinded its interpretations of sections a and b of the fra and replaced these interpretations with regulation w 
in addition  regulation w makes various changes to existing law regarding sections a and b of the fra  including expanding the definition of what constitutes an affiliate subject to sections a and b of the fra 
the federal reserve board s final rule does not by its terms apply to savings associations 
however  because the ots incorporates regulation w and applies it to savings associations  sections a and b of the fra apply to the bank in the same manner and to the same extent as if the bank were a member bank 
the ots rules incorporate all applicable provisions and exceptions prescribed by the federal reserve board in regulation w  provide guidance regarding the additional prohibitions on savings associations with respect to transactions with affiliates under hola  and set out the additional restrictions that the ots imposes on savings associations under hola with regard to transactions with affiliates 
under regulation w  all transactions entered into on or before december   which either became subject to sections a and b of the fra solely because of regulation w  and all transactions covered by sections a and b of the fra  the treatment of which will change solely because of regulation w  became subject to regulation w on july  all other covered affiliate transactions became subject to regulation w on april  the federal reserve board expects each depository institution that is subject to sections a and b of the fra to implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance with regulation w 
the bank s authority to extend credit to its directors  executive officers and stockholders  as well as to entities controlled by such persons  is currently governed by the requirements of sections g and h of the fra and regulation o of the federal reserve board thereunder 
among other things  these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders a be made on terms that are substantially the same as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and b not exceed certain limitations on the amount of the association s capital 
in addition  extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the bank s board of directors 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act prohibits the extension of personal loans to directors and executive officers of issuers as defined in the sarbanes oxley act 
the prohibition  however  does not apply to mortgages advanced by an insured depository institution  such as the bank  that are subject to the insider lending restrictions of section h of the fra 
certain transactions with directors  officers or controlling persons are also subject to conflict of interest regulations enforced by the ots 
these conflict of interest regulations and other statutes also impose restrictions on loans to such persons and their related interests 
among other things  such loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those for loans to unaffiliated individuals 
real estate lending standards 
the ots and the other federal banking agencies adopted regulations to prescribe standards for extensions of credit that a are secured by real estate or b are made for the purpose of financing the construction of improvements on real estate 
the ots regulations require the bank to establish and maintain written internal real estate lending standards that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and appropriate to the size of the association and the nature and scope of its real estate lending activities 
the standards also must be consistent with accompanying ots guidelines  which include loan to value ratios for the different types of real estate loans 
the bank is also permitted to make a limited amount of loans that do not conform to the proposed loan to value limitations so long as such exceptions are reviewed and justified appropriately 
the guidelines also list a number of lending situations in which exceptions to the loan to value standards are justified 
privacy regulations 
under the ots regulations adopted pursuant to the gramm leach bliley act of glb act  the bank is required to adopt procedures to protect customers nonpublic personal information 
the regulations generally require that the bank disclose its privacy policy  including identifying with whom it shares a customer s nonpublic personal information  to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter 
in addition  the bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt out of having it share their personal information with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to nonaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes 
the bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place  which has been reviewed  for compliance with the regulations 
federal reserve system 
under frb regulations  the bank is required to maintain noninterest earning reserves against its transaction accounts 
frb regulations generally require that a reserves of must be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts of million or less  subject to adjustment by the frb  and b a reserve of million plus must be maintained against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of million 
the first million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements 
the bank is in compliance with these reserve requirements at june  because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash  a noninterest bearing account at a frb  or a passthrough account as defined by the frb  the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the bank s interest earning assets to the extent that the requirement exceeds vault cash 
federal home loan bank system

for the fiscal year ended june   dividends paid by the fhlb of des moines to the bank totaled approximately  which constitutes a  increase in the amount of dividends received in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to an increase in the dividend rate approved by the fhlb board of directors 
trust activities regulation

under these laws  regulations and policies  the trust activities of federal savings banks are governed by both federal and state laws

see the section above entitled qualified thrift lender test 
in addition  for grandfathered savings and loan holding companies  such as the company  the glb act also prohibits the sale of such entities to nonfinancial companies
