overview we are a leading supplier of automation products and solutions primarily serving the worldwide semiconductor market 
we supply hardware  software and services to both chip manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers  or oems  who make semiconductor device manufacturing equipment 
we are a technology and market leader with offerings ranging from individual hardware and software modules to fully integrated systems as well as services to install and support our products world wide 
although our core business addresses the increasingly complex automation requirements of the global semiconductor industry  we are also focused on providing automation solutions for a number of related industries  including flat panel display manufacturing  data storage and other complex manufacturing 

table of contents we operate in two segments hardware and software 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company s equipment automation and factory automation segments were combined into the hardware segment  which reflects how management now evaluates its business 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
the hardware segment provides wafer handling products and components for use within semiconductor process equipment 
these systems automate the movement of wafers into and out of semiconductor manufacturing process chambers and provide an integration point between factory automation systems and process tools 
the products offered by brooks include vacuum and atmospheric systems and robots and related components 
we also offer the assembly and manufacturing of customer designed automation systems  or contract automation systems 
the primary customers for these solutions are manufacturers of process tool equipment 
additionally  we provide hardware directly to fabs including automated material handling systems  or amhs  that use overhead monorail systems and overhead hoist vehicles to store  transport and manage the movement of material throughout the fab 
other hardware products include equipment for lithography automation that manage the storage  inspection and transport of photomasks  or reticles 
the software segment addresses the need for production management systems driven by the extensive tracking and tracing requirements of the semiconductor industry 
our software products enable semiconductor manufacturers to increase their return on investment by maximizing production efficiency  and may be sold as part of an integrated solution or on a stand alone basis 
these software products and services are also used in many similar manufacturing industries as semiconductor  including flat panel display  data storage  and electronic assembly 
in june  the company signed definitive purchase and sale agreements to sell substantially all the assets of the company s specialty equipment and life sciences division sels  formerly known as ias  which provided standard and custom automation technology and products for the semiconductor  photonics  life sciences and certain other industries 
this sale was completed and all activities of sels have ceased during the fourth quarter of fiscal effective june  the company s consolidated financial statements and notes have been reclassified to reflect this business as a discontinued operation in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature  and we are in a period where the market conditions indicate relatively flat to declining demand in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year we are focusing our major efforts in the following areas sustaining our ability to meet our customers requirements on a timely basis  continuing to invest in other industries such as flat panel display manufacturing for our equipment automation products  expanding our sales of equipment automation products to process tool manufacturers that currently produce automation equipment internally  continuing to develop our customer designed automation cda business with process tool manufacturers  greater expansion of software development capabilities in countries outside of the united states  specifically india and korea  greater expansion of our hardware and software products into the china market  implementing new sales and service strategies to improve customer support and satisfaction  implementing a final integration and test strategy to provide manufacturing capabilities for customer specific end of line configuration of our products  evaluating our strategic direction and value of non core products  
table of contents improving the efficiency of our internal information and business systems  which could result in the upgrade or replacement of certain applications  and continuing to evaluate on an opportunistic basis whether new acquisitions of or alliances with other companies would be beneficial to our business and shareholders 
in fiscal  our total revenues decreased to million from the prior year compared to growth in fiscal this decrease is consistent with  and reflective of  lower industry demand for semiconductor capital equipment in fiscal our revenue by segment for fiscal and is as follows for the year ended september  hardware software our hardware segment revenues decreased from the prior year to million 
this decrease reflects the lower demand for semiconductor capital equipment during fiscal year we expect fiscal revenues for our hardware segment to remain relatively flat compared to present levels in the absence of any industry trend toward higher demand 
our software segment revenues decreased from the prior year to million 
the decrease is primarily attributable to lower market demand for our software products  and by the absence of the significant european software project for approximately million which was recognized upon completion in the second quarter of fiscal we expect fiscal revenues for our software segment to remain relatively flat as compared to present levels as decreasing forecasted demand from semiconductor customers is offset by increased demand for our software products from other industries 
gross margins decreased percentage points to for fiscal from the prior year in comparison to a percentage point increase in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to reduced overhead absorption due to reduced sales volumes 
we expect our gross margins to increase slightly in the near term as a result of various cost reduction measures 
we recorded a loss from continuing operations of million or per diluted share in fiscal compared to a net income from continuing operations of million or per diluted share in fiscal this loss is the result of declining revenues and gross margins and includes a restructuring charge of million related to workforce reductions and excess facilities charges 
we were able  however  to generate million of cash from operations in fiscal year as a result of diligent working capital management  compared to a positive cash flow from operations of million in fiscal at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating million 
recent developments on july   the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement with helix technology corporation helix  a delaware corporation and mt 
hood corporation mt 
hood  a newly formed delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
this acquisition closed on october  under the terms of the merger agreement  mt 
hood merged the merger with and into helix  with helix continuing as the surviving corporation 
each share of helix common stock  par value per share  other than shares held by helix as treasury stock and shares held by the company or mt 
hood  was cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into exchange ratio shares of the company s common stock 
in addition  the company assumed all options then outstanding under helix s existing equity incentive plans  each of which is now exercisable into a number of shares of the company s common stock and at an exercise price adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio 
the helix acquisition is preliminarily valued at approximately million  consisting of million shares of common stock valued at million  the fair value of assumed helix options of million  and cash of million 
this transaction qualifies as a tax free reorganization under section a of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and the company is in the process of evaluating the impact that 
table of contents the merger may have on the company s net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
helix is a leader in the development  manufacture  and application of innovative vacuum technology solutions for the semiconductor  data storage  and flat panel display markets 
the acquisition of helix enables us to better serve our current market  increase our addressable market  reduce the volatility that both businesses have historically faced and position us to enhance our financial performance 
related parties on june   we appointed joseph r 
martin to our board of directors 
mr 
martin is a director of fairchild semiconductor international  inc fairchild  one of our customers 
accordingly  fairchild is considered a related party for the period subsequent to june  revenues from fairchild for the years ended september   and were approximately   and  respectively 
the amounts due from fairchild included in accounts receivable at september  and were  and  respectively 
related party transactions and amounts included in accounts receivable and revenue are on standard pricing and contractual terms and manner of settlement for products and services of similar types and at comparable volumes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  the adequacy of restructuring reserves and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  including current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions both in general and specifically in relation to the semiconductor industry  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
as discussed in the year over year comparisons below  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenues product revenues are associated with the sale of hardware systems and components as well as software licenses 
service revenues are associated with hardware related field service  training  software maintenance and software related consulting and integration services 
revenue from product sales that do not include significant customization is recorded upon delivery and transfer of risk of loss to the customer provided there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and  if applicable  customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
customer acceptance provisions include final testing and acceptance carried out prior to shipment 
these pre shipment testing and acceptance procedures ensure that the product meets the published specification requirements before the product is shipped 
in the limited situations where the arrangement contains extended payment terms  revenue is recognized as the payments become due 
shipping terms are customarily fob shipping point 
amounts charged to customers for costs incurred for shipping and handling and reimbursable expenses are included in revenues with the corresponding cost recorded in cost of revenues 
when significant on site customer acceptance provisions are present in the arrangement  revenue is recognized upon completion of customer acceptance testing 
revenue from the sale of off the shelf software licenses is recognized upon delivery to the customer provided there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is probable  and there are no unusual acceptance criteria or extended payment terms 
if the 
table of contents arrangement contains acceptance criteria or testing  then revenue is recognized upon acceptance or the successful completion of the testing 
if the arrangement contains extended payment terms  revenue is recognized as the payments become due 
revenue related to post contract support is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period 
for tailored software contracts  we provide significant consulting services to tailor the software to the customer s environment 
if we are able to reasonably estimate the level of effort and related costs to complete the contract  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method  which compares costs incurred to total estimated project cost 
revisions in revenue and cost estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that require such revisions become known 
if our ability to complete the tailored software is uncertain or if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort and related costs  completed contract accounting is applied 
losses  if any  are provided for in the period in which such losses are first identified by management 
generally  the terms of long term contracts provide for progress billing based on completion of certain phases of work 
for maintenance contracts  service revenue is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence of its fair value and is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract 
deferred revenue primarily relates to services and maintenance agreements and billings in excess of revenue recognized on long term contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion method and contracts awaiting final customer acceptance 
in transactions that include multiple products and or services  such as tailored software arrangements  described above  or software sales with post contract support  we allocate the sales value among each of the elements based on their relative fair values and recognize such revenue when each element is delivered 
if these relative fair values are not known  the company uses the residual method to recognize revenue from arrangements with one or more elements to be delivered at a future date  when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of any the undelivered elements at the date of delivery  such as post contract support  are deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
the company determines fair value of undelivered services based on the prices that are charged when the same element is sold separately to customers 
intangible assets and goodwill we have made a number of acquisitions in previous years  and as a result  identified significant intangible assets and generated significant goodwill 
intangible assets are valued based on estimates of future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful life 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing as well as testing upon the occurrence of any event that indicates a potential impairment 
intangible assets and other long lived assets are subject to an impairment test if there is an indicator of impairment 
the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use 
if our expectations of future results and cash flows are significantly diminished  intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we use the projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether an impairment exists  and then measure the impairment using discounted cash flows 
for goodwill  we compare the fair value of our reporting units by measuring discounted cash flows to the book value of the reporting units and measure impairment  if any  as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value of the goodwill 
the estimation of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
we have elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment testing as required under fas on september of each fiscal year 
in fiscal  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test under fas in the fourth quarter 
during this process estimates of revenue and expense were developed for each of our segments and as a whole based on internal as well as external market forecasts 
based on this analysis  
table of contents we determined that the implied fair value of the our former factory automation hardware reporting unit s goodwill was less than its book value and therefore recorded a charge of million to operations to write down the value of this goodwill 
in connection with a third party letter of intent dated october  to purchase the assets of our former sels division  we assessed the potential impairment of goodwill in the segment 
we considered the offer in the letter of intent as an indication of the fair value of the segment 
based on our analysis  we determined that the implied fair value of the goodwill associated with the sels division was million less than its book value and recorded a charge to write down the value of this goodwill in the fourth quarter 
this charge has been recorded as a component of the loss from discontinued operations of million for fiscal year we performed our annual impairment test under fas in the fourth quarter of fiscal on all other segments and fiscal for all segments using a discounted cash flow analyses of expectations of future earnings 
during this process detailed estimates of revenue and expense were developed for the reporting units based on internal as well as external market forecasts 
our analyses indicated no impairment of the goodwill in fiscal or fiscal accounts receivable we record trade accounts receivable at the invoiced amount 
trade accounts receivables do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable 
the company determines the allowance based on historical write off experience by industry 
the company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
past due balances over days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectibility 
all other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis by type of receivable 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company feels it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
the company does not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is estimated by assessing product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and may result in additional benefits or charges to operations 
inventory we provide reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we fully reserve for inventories and noncancelable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete 
we perform periodic reviews of all inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand  based upon sales and marketing inputs through our planning systems 
if estimates of demand diminish further or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we would be able 
table of contents to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we subsequently determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues we reported revenues of million for the year ended september   compared to million in the previous year  a decrease 
the decrease is consistent with and reflective of the lower demand for semiconductor capital equipment experienced in fiscal our hardware segment reported revenues of million in the year ended september   a decrease of from the prior year 
this decrease reflects the lower demand for semiconductor capital equipment during fiscal year we expect fiscal revenues for our hardware segment to remain relatively flat compared to present levels in the absence of any industry trend for higher demand 
our software segment reported revenues of million  a decrease from million in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to lower software license sales driven by reduced market demand 
included in the march  quarter we recognized million of revenue on a european software services project which had been accounted for on the completed contract basis 
excluding the impact of this contract for fiscal year  software revenues decreased by million or 
we expect fiscal revenues for our software segment to remain relatively flat as compared to present levels as decreasing forecasted demand from semiconductor customers is offset by increased demand for our software products from other industries 
a significant portion of revenue for the software segment relates to maintenance contracts 
maintenance revenues are only slightly affected by an economic downturn  as customers typically continue to use previously purchased software products and renew related maintenance arrangements 
product revenues decreased million  or  to million  in the year ended september   from million in the previous year 
this decrease is attributable to reduced demand for our hardware products and software license revenues reflective of industry trends of decreased demand for semiconductor capital equipment in fiscal product revenues associated with our hardware segment decreased by from fiscal levels  while product revenues from our software segment decreased by 
service revenues decreased million  or  to million 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the completion and acceptance by the customer of a major european software project for approximately million in the second quarter of fiscal revenues outside the united states were million  or of total revenues  and million  or of total revenues  in the years ended september  and  respectively 
we expect that foreign revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenues 
the current international component of revenues is not indicative of the future international component of revenues 
deferred revenue of million at september  consisted of million related to deferred maintenance contracts and million related to revenues deferred for percentage of completion method arrangements and contracts awaiting final customer acceptance 
gross margin gross margin decreased to million or for the year ended september   compared to million or for the previous year 
our hardware segment gross margin decreased to million or in the year ended september   from million or in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to reduced overhead absorption due to reduced sales volumes 
our software segment s gross margin for the year ended september   decreased to million or  compared to million or in the prior year 
the decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to lower software license sales 
the increase in the gross margin as a percentage of revenue primarily reflects the 
table of contents impact of lower gross margins realized on the million of software project revenue recognized upon completion and acceptance by the customer in the second quarter of fiscal gross margin on product revenues was million or for the year ended september   compared to million or for the prior year 
the decrease in product margins is primarily attributable to reduced overhead absorption due to reduced sales volumes 
gross margin on service revenues was million or for the year ended september   compared to million or in the previous year 
the increase is primarily the result of the higher margins on hardware segment services coupled with the impact of lower gross margins realized on the million software project revenue discussed above 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended september   were million  a decrease of million  compared to million in the previous year 
research and development expenses increased as a percentage of revenues  to  from in the prior year 
the decrease in absolute spending is primarily the result of our cost reduction actions  while the increase as a percentage of revenue reflects the lower revenue levels against which these costs were measured 
our plan in hardware is to continue to invest in research and development to enhance existing products and develop new products for the semiconductor industry 
our plan in software is to continue to invest in research and development to enhance existing factory automation products and develop new products for the semiconductor market  as well as invest in the development of manufacturing software for other industries  principally medical instrumentation 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  compared to million in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues  to in the year ended september   from in the previous year 
the decrease in absolute spending is primarily due to lower expenses for incentive compensation plans of approximately million  offset by costs for sarbanes oxley compliance and the reversal of excess bad debt reserves of million recorded in fiscal  while the increase as a percentage of revenue reflects the lower revenue levels against which these costs were measured 
amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization expense for acquired intangible assets totaled million for the year ended september   compared to million for the prior year 
the reduction in amortization of acquired intangible assets is primarily attributable to certain assets reaching the end of their useful lives in fiscal restructuring and acquisition related charges we recorded a charge to continuing operations of million in the year ended september   of which million related to workforce reductions of approximately employees worldwide and million to excess facilities charges 
workforce reduction charges included million for headcount reductions of approximately employees associated with our software segment  million for reductions of approximately employees in our jena  germany facility and million related to various other actions undertaken in fiscal excess facilities charges of million consisted of excess facilities identified in fiscal that were recorded to recognize the expected amount of the remaining lease obligations 
these costs have been estimated from the time when the space is vacant  and there are no plans to utilize the facility 
costs incurred prior to vacating the facilities were charged to operations 
of the million of facilities charges  million represents an additional accrual on a previous vacated facility due to a longer period than initially estimated to sub lease the facility 
this revision  including lower estimates of expected sub rental 
table of contents income over the remainder of the lease terms  are based on management s evaluation of the rental space available 
the balance of these excess facilities charges primarily relates to excess and abandoned facilities in toronto canada  jena germany  austin texas  and livingston scotland 
we believe that the cost reduction programs implemented will align costs with revenues at present levels 
in the event we are unable to achieve this alignment  additional cost cutting programs may be required in the future 
the accruals for workforce reductions are expected to be paid over the fiscal year the facilities charges are expected to be paid over the remaining lease periods extending to these charges helped better align our cost structure 
we estimate that salary and benefit savings as a result of these actions will be approximately million annually 
the impact of these cost reductions on our liquidity is not significant  as these actions yield equivalent actual cash savings within twelve months 
we also recorded a charge of million in fiscal year for workforce reductions of approximately employees related to our discontinued sels division  which is included in the loss from discontinued operations 
we recorded a charge to continuing operations of million in the year ended september   of which million related to acquisitions and million to restructuring costs 
the million related to acquisitions is comprised of million of legal and consulting costs to integrate and consolidate acquired entities into our existing entities 
the million of restructuring costs consisted of million related to workforce reductions of approximately employees world wide  across all functions of the business and million related to excess facilities 
excess facilities charges of million consisted of million for excess facilities identified in fiscal that we recorded to recognize the amount of remaining lease obligations 
these costs have been estimated from the time when the space is vacant  and there are no plans to utilize the facility 
costs incurred prior to vacating the facilities were charged to operations 
final exit costs for facilities abandoned in previous restructurings amounted to million 
the remaining million represents a reevaluation of the assumptions used in determining the fair value of certain lease obligations related to facilities abandoned in a previous restructuring 
interest income and expense interest income increased by million  to million  in the year ended september   from million the previous year 
this increase is due primarily to higher cash balances available for investment 
interest expense of million in each of the years ended september  and  respectively  relates primarily to the convertible subordinated notes 
other income expense other income  net of million for the year ended september  consisted of the receipt of principal repayments on a note that had been previously written off  foreign exchange gains  and gains on the sales of other assets 
other expense  net of million for the year ended september  consisted primarily of the settlement of an arbitration proceeding in israel of million and realized losses on foreign currency transactions during the year 
income tax provision we recorded an income tax provision of million in the year ended september  and an income tax provision of million in the year ended september  the tax provision recorded in fiscal and is attributable to foreign income and withholding taxes 
we continued to provide a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets at september  and  as we believe it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses and deferred taxes will not be realized 
if we generate future taxable income against which these tax attributes may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and a corresponding increase in net income would be reported in future periods 

table of contents discontinued operations we recorded a loss from operations for our discontinued sels business of million for the year ended september   compared to a loss of million in the previous year 
the reduced loss reflects the winding down of this business in fiscal year  and the million goodwill impairment charge recorded in fiscal year as previously discussed in intangible assets and goodwill 
year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues we reported revenues of million for the year ended september   compared to million in the previous year  a increase 
the increase is consistent with and reflective of a large increase in demand for semiconductor capital equipment experienced in fiscal our hardware segment reported revenues of million in the year ended september   an increase of from the million in the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in order volume and market demand  reflective of current industry trends of increased demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
our software segment reported revenues of million  a increase from million in the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to strong software license sales driven by increased market demand coupled with the completion and acceptance by the customer of a major european software project for approximately million in the second quarter of fiscal product revenues increased million  or  to million  in the year ended september   from million in the previous fiscal year 
product revenues for our hardware and software segments grew by  and  respectively  from fiscal levels 
service revenues increased million  or  to million 
this increase is primarily attributable to the completion and acceptance by the customer of a major european software project for approximately million in the second quarter of fiscal we were unable to make a reasonable and dependable estimate of the costs to fulfill this contract due to the complexity of the arrangement 
as a result  we concluded that the completed contract method of accounting was required for this contract 
revenues outside the united states were million  or of total revenues  and million  or of total revenues  in the years ended september  and  respectively 
we expect that foreign revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenues 
the current international component of revenues is not indicative of the future international component of revenues 
deferred revenues of million at september  consisted of million related to deferred maintenance contracts and million related to revenues deferred for completed contract method arrangements and contracts awaiting final customer acceptance 
gross margin gross margin increased to million or for the year ended september   compared to million or for the previous year 
our hardware segment gross margin increased to million or in the year ended september   from million or in the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to our plant consolidation and other cost reduction measures along with increased volumes resulting in more favorable absorption of fixed costs  along with the completion of several low margin projects which contributed to lower margins in fiscal our software segment s gross margin for the year ended september   increased to million or  compared to million or in the prior year 
the increase is primarily the result of higher license revenue  which yield higher gross margins in the current year period and the favorable impact of our cost reduction measures  offset by the impact of lower gross margins realized on the million of software project revenue recognized upon completion and acceptance by the customer in the second quarter of fiscal 
table of contents gross margin on product revenues was million or for the year ended september   compared to million or for the prior year 
the increase in product margins is primarily attributable to the impact of our cost reduction measures along with a more favorable hardware product mix and software license revenues which have higher gross margins 
gross margin on service revenues was million or for the year ended september   compared to million or in the previous year 
the decrease is primarily the result of the services revenue mix partially offset by the positive impact of our cost reduction initiatives 
service revenues margins were impacted by lower gross margins realized on the million of software project revenue recognized upon completion and acceptance by the customer in the second quarter of fiscal research and development research and development expenses for the year ended september  were million  a decrease of million  compared to million in the previous year 
research and development expenses also decreased as a percentage of revenues to  from in the prior year 
the decrease in absolute spending and as a percentage of revenues is primarily the result of our cost reduction actions coupled with higher revenue levels against which these costs were measured 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  compared to million in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues  to in the year ended september   from in the previous year 
apart from the higher revenue levels against which these costs were measured  the decrease in absolute spending and as a percentage of revenues is primarily the result of our cost containment and reduction initiatives as well as the reversal of excess bad debt reserves of million in fiscal as collections of overdue receivables improved 
this decrease is offset by higher expenses for incentive compensation plans that we have established in fiscal amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization expense for acquired intangible assets totaled million for the year ended september   compared to million for the prior year 
the reduction in amortization of acquired intangible assets is attributable to certain assets reaching the end of their useful lives 
goodwill impairment charges goodwill impairment charges totaled million for the year ended september  and consisted of the impairment of our goodwill related to our former factory automation hardware segment  as described previously in intangible assets and goodwill 
restructuring and acquisition related charges we recorded a charge to operations of million in the year ended september   of which million related to acquisitions and million to restructuring costs 
the million related to acquisitions is legal and consulting costs to integrate and consolidate acquired entities into our existing entities 
the million of restructuring costs consisted of million related to workforce reductions of approximately employees world wide  across all functions of the business and million related to excess facilities 
excess facilities charges of million consisted of million for excess facilities identified in fiscal that were recorded to recognize the expected amount of the remaining lease obligations 
these costs have been estimated from the time when the space is vacant  and there are no plans to utilize the facility 
costs incurred prior to vacating the facilities were charged to operations 
final exit costs for facilities abandoned in previous restructurings amounted to million 
the remaining million represents a reevaluation of the assumptions used in determining the fair value of certain lease obligations related to facilities abandoned in a previous restructuring 
the revised assumptions  including lower estimates of 
table of contents expected sub rental income over the remainder of the lease terms  are based on management s evaluation of the rental space available 
these charges helped better align our cost structure 
we estimate that salary and benefit savings in principally the selling  general and administrative functions as a result of these actions were approximately million annually 
we recorded a charge to operations of million in the year ended september   of which million related to acquisitions  million related to the write off of capitalized costs associated with cancelled internal systems applications and infrastructure programs  and million to restructuring costs 
of this amount  million related to workforce reductions of approximately  employees and million related to excess facilities 
excess facilities charges of million consisted of million for excess facilities identified in fiscal that were recorded to recognize the remaining lease obligations  net of any sublease rentals 
these costs have been estimated from the time when the space is vacant and there are no plans to utilize the facilities 
costs incurred prior to vacating the facilities were charged to operations 
the remaining million represents a reevaluation of assumptions used in determining the fair value of certain lease obligations related to facilities abandoned in a previous restructuring 
the revised assumptions  including lower estimates of expected sub rental income over the remainder of the lease terms are based on management s evaluation of the rental space available 
periodically  the accruals related to restructuring charges are reviewed and compared to their respective cash requirements 
as a result of those reviews  the accruals are adjusted for changes in cost and timing assumptions of previously accrued and recorded initiatives 
during fiscal  we identified million of excess accruals associated with headcount reduction plans previously announced and implemented and million of excess accruals for other restructuring costs 
the final costs associated with these actions were lower than originally anticipated and accrued 
as a result  the excess accruals for these actions were reversed  with a corresponding reduction to restructuring expense 
the million related to acquisitions is comprised of the million loss on the disposition of our swiss subsidiary  associated legal costs of million and million of legal  relocation and consulting costs to integrate and consolidate acquired entities into our existing entities 
these charges helped better align our cost structure 
we estimate that salary and benefit savings across all expense categories as a result of these actions were approximately million annually 
the impact of these cost reductions on our liquidity is not significant  as these cost savings yield actual cash savings within twelve months 
we estimate annual facilities savings were approximately million principally within our cost of sales as a result of these actions 
interest income and expense interest income increased by million  to million  in the year ended september   from million the previous year 
this increase is due primarily to higher cash balances that were available for investment offset by lower interest rates that were realized on our investment balances 
interest expense of million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively  relates primarily to the convertible subordinated notes 
other income expense other expense decreased by million  to million  in the year ended september   from million the previous year 
other expense for the year ended september  consisted primarily of the settlement of an arbitration proceeding in israel of million and realized losses on foreign currency transactions during the year 
other expense in the year ended september  consisted primarily of losses we incurred as a result of the disposal of the shinsung warrants and shares in the amount of million and million  respectively  and realized losses on foreign currency transactions 
income tax provision we recorded an income tax provision of million in the year ended september  and an income tax provision of million in the year ended september  the tax provision recorded in fiscal and is attributable to foreign income and withholding taxes 
we continued to provide a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets at september  and  as we believe it is more 
table of contents likely than not that the future tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses and deferred taxes will not be realized 
if we generate future taxable income against which these tax attributes may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and a corresponding increase in net income would be reported in future periods 
discontinued operations we recorded a loss from operations for our discontinued sels business of million for the year ended september   compared to a loss of million in the previous year 
the increased loss was due to the million goodwill impairment charge recorded in fiscal year as previously discussed in intangible assets and goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources our business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and oem s that are  in turn  dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
demand for semiconductors is cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
the semiconductor industry experienced such a downturn that extended from well into the downturn affected revenues  gross margins and operating results 
in response to this downturn  we have implemented cost reduction programs aimed at aligning our ongoing operating costs with our currently expected revenues over the near term 
these cost management initiatives have included consolidating facilities  reductions to headcount  salary and wage reductions and reduced spending 
we believe the semiconductor industry has again softened after a modest upturn in our revenues in fiscal year declined from the prior fiscal year 
we believe that the cost reduction programs implemented have aligned costs with revenues 
in the event we are unable to sustain this alignment  additional cost cutting programs may be required in the future 
the cyclical nature of the industry make estimates of future revenues  results of operations and net cash flows inherently uncertain 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating million 
this amount was comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investments in short term marketable securities and million of investments in long term marketable securities 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating million 
this amount was comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investments in short term marketable securities and million of investments in long term marketable securities 
cash and cash equivalents were million at september   an increase of million from september  this increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to cash provided by operations of million and million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock offset by net purchases of marketable securities of million and million used for capital additions 
cash provided by operations was million for the year ended september   and was primarily attributable to changes in our net working capital of million offset by our net loss of million and adjusted for non cash depreciation and amortization of million and compensation expense related to common stock and options of million 
this change in working capital was primarily the result of decreased accounts receivable balances of million and a decreased inventory balance of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable is a result of our strong collection efforts through fiscal year  and a reduced level of business 
the decrease in inventory is a result of our continued focus of inventory management and is also reflective of decreased balances of deferred inventory located at customer sites waiting for acceptance 
other changes in working capital included decreased accounts payable levels of million primarily as a result of lower inventory purchases  decreased deferred revenue of million due principally to the reduced level of business  decreased accrued compensation and benefits of million resulting from payments for variable compensation plans  and decreased accrued expenses and other liabilities of million primarily due to the million retirement benefit paid to our former chief executive officer in january under the terms of his employment agreement 

table of contents cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended september   and is principally comprised of net purchases of marketable securities of million and million used for capital additions  offset by proceeds from the sale of long lived assets of million 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended september  from the issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of options to purchase our common stock 
on may   we completed the private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due in interest on the notes is paid on june and december of each year 
the notes will mature on june  we may redeem the notes at stated premiums 
holders may require us to repurchase the notes upon a change in control of us in certain circumstances 
the notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity  at the option of the holders  into shares of our common stock  at a conversion price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
the notes are subordinated to our senior indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
while we have no significant capital commitments  as we expand our product offerings  we anticipate that we will continue to make capital expenditures to support our business and improve our computer systems infrastructure 
we may also use our resources to acquire companies  technologies or products that complement our business 
at september   we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding our contractual obligations consist of the following in thousands less than one to four to total one year three years five years thereafter contractual obligations operating leases continuing operating leases exited facilities purchase commitments debt interest on convertible subordinated notes total contractual obligations we believe that our existing resources will be adequate to fund our currently planned working capital and capital expenditure requirements for both the short and long term 
however  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry makes it difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
we may be unable to obtain any required additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund our expansion  successfully develop or enhance products  respond to competitive pressure or take advantage of acquisition opportunities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business

r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r replaces sfas and supersedes apb sfas r focuses primarily on the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share 
table of contents based payment transactions 
sfas r requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
sfas r was originally expected to be effective for the company beginning in its third quarter of fiscal year in april  the effective date was amended by the securities and exchange commission 
as a result  sfas r is now effective for the company as of october  accordingly  the company will adopt sfas r in its first quarter of fiscal year the company expects to use the modified prospective transition method and will not restate prior periods for the adoption of sfas r 
although the company is currently evaluating the provisions of sfas r and its implications on its employee benefit plans  the company believes that the adoption of this standard  based on the terms of the options outstanding at september   will have a material effect on its net income in fiscal year the company is also evaluating the form of any stock based incentive compensation it may offer in the future

factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this report before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock 
these are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general  may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition and operating results would likely suffer 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks relating to our industry due in part to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor manufacturing industry and related industries  we have recently incurred substantial operating losses and may have future losses 
our business is largely dependent on capital expenditures in the semiconductor manufacturing industry and other businesses employing similar manufacturing technology 
the semiconductor manufacturing industry in turn depends on current and anticipated demand for integrated circuits and the products that use them 
in recent years  these businesses have experienced unpredictable and volatile business cycles due in large part to rapid changes in demand and manufacturing capacity for semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry 
table of contents experienced a prolonged downturn  which negatively impacted us from the third quarter of fiscal until well into as a result of that downturn  our oem and end user customers significantly reduced the rate at which they purchased our products and services 
that reduced demand adversely affected our sales volume and gross margins and resulted in substantial operating losses during fiscal  and these losses were due to  among other things  writedowns for obsolete inventory and expenses related to investments in research and development and global service and support necessary to maintain our competitive position 
although our business became profitable during  a downward trend again developed during fiscal in the semiconductor industry  and our revenues in the fiscal year just ended declined from the prior year 
we could continue to experience future operating losses during an industry downturn and any period of uncertain demand 
if an industry downturn continues for an extended period of time  our business could be materially harmed 
conversely  if demand improves rapidly  we could have insufficient inventory and manufacturing capacity to meet our customer needs on a timely basis  which could result in the loss of customers and various other expenses that could reduce gross margins and profitability 
we cannot assure you as to whether we will be able to attain the profitability we have recently achieved 
risks relating to brooks our operating results could fluctuate significantly  which could negatively impact our business 
our revenues  operating margins and other operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon a variety of factors  including demand for our products as a result of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor manufacturing industry and the markets upon which it depends or otherwise  changes in the timing and terms of product orders by our customers as a result of our customer concentration or otherwise  changes in the mix of products and services that we offer  timing and market acceptance of our new product introductions  delays or problems in the planned introduction of new products  or in the performance of any such products following delivery to customers  our competitors announcements of new products  services or technological innovations  which can  among other things  render our products less competitive due to the rapid technological change in our industry  the timing and related costs of any acquisitions  divestitures or other strategic transactions  our ability to reduce our costs due to decreased demand for our products and services  disruptions in our manufacturing process or in the supply of components to us  write offs for excess or obsolete inventory  and competitive pricing pressures 
as a result of these risks  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful  and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance 
if our quarterly results fluctuate significantly  our business could be harmed 
our restructuring activities and cost reduction measures may be insufficient to offset reduced demand for our products and may have materially harmed our business 
primarily in response to reduced demand for our products  during recent downturns in the semiconductor industry  we implemented cost reductions and other restructuring activities throughout our organization 
these cost saving measures included several reductions in workforce  salary and wage reductions  reduced 
table of contents inventory levels  consolidation of our manufacturing facilities to our chelmsford  massachusetts facilities and the discontinuation of certain product lines and information technology projects 
although we had net income in fiscal when the semiconductor industry rebounded  we experienced a net loss in fiscal when our sales levels begin to decline 
our failure to adequately manage our costs  in response to reduced demand for our products and services  could materially harm our business and prospects and our ability to maintain our competitive position 
our restructuring activities could harm us because they may result in reduced productivity by our employees and increased difficulty in retaining and hiring a sufficient number of qualified employees familiar with our products and processes and the locales in which we operate 
delays and technical difficulties in our products and operations may result in lost revenue  lost profit  delayed or limited market acceptance or product liability claims 
as the technology in our systems and manufacturing operations has become more complex and customized  it has become increasingly difficult to design and integrate these technologies into our newly introduced systems  procure adequate supplies of specialized components  train technical and manufacturing personnel and make timely transitions to volume manufacturing 
due to the complexity of our manufacturing processes  we have on occasion failed to meet our customers delivery or performance criteria  and as a result we have deferred revenue recognition  incurred late delivery penalties and had higher warranty and service costs 
we cannot guarantee that we will not experience these problems in the future 
we may be unable to recover expenses we incur due to changes or cancellations of customized orders 
there are also substantial unanticipated costs associated with ensuring that new products function properly and reliably in the early stages of their life cycle 
these costs have been and could in the future be greater than expected as a result of these complexities 
our failure to control these costs could materially harm our business and profitability 
because many of our customers use our products for business critical applications  any errors  defects or other performance or technical problems could result in financial or other damage to our customers and could significantly impair their operations 
our customers could seek to recover damages from us for losses related to any of these issues 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if not successful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend and could adversely affect our marketing efforts 
if we do not continue to introduce new products and services that reflect advances in technology in a timely and effective manner  our products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will suffer 
our success is dependent on our ability to respond to the rapid rate of technological change present in the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
during fiscal we introduced new products in several market segments 
the success of our product development and introduction depends on our ability to accurately identify and define new market opportunities and products  obtain market acceptance of our products  timely innovate  develop and commercialize new technologies and applications  adjust to changing market conditions  differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings  ability to obtain intellectual property rights  continue to develop a comprehensive  integrated product and service strategy  properly price our products and services  and design our products to high standards of manufacturability such that they meet customer requirements if we cannot succeed in responding in a timely manner to technological and or market changes or if the new products that we introduce do not achieve market acceptance  we could lose our competitive position which could materially harm our business and our prospects 

table of contents the global nature of our business exposes us to multiple risks 
for the twelve months ended september   approximately of our revenues were derived from sales outside north america 
we expect that international sales  including increased sales in asia  will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues 
as a result of our international operations  we are exposed to many risks and uncertainties  including difficulties in staffing  managing and supporting operations in multiple countries  longer sales cycles and time to collection  tariff and international trade barriers  fewer legal protections for intellectual property and contract rights abroad  different and changing legal and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate  government currency control and restrictions on repatriation of earnings  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates  and political and economic changes  hostilities and other disruptions in regions where we operate 
negative developments in any of these areas in one or more countries could result in a reduction in demand for our products  the cancellation or delay of orders already placed  threats to our intellectual property  difficulty in collecting receivables  and a higher cost of doing business  any of which could materially harm our business and profitability 
our business could be materially harmed if we fail to adequately integrate the operations of the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire 
we acquired helix effective october  in addition we have made in the past  and may make in the future  acquisitions or significant investments in businesses with complementary products  services and or technologies 
our acquisitions present numerous risks  including difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired companies and realizing the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses  defining and executing a comprehensive product strategy  managing the risks of entering markets or types of businesses in which we have limited or no direct experience  the potential loss of key employees  customers and strategic partners of acquired companies  unanticipated problems or latent liabilities  such as problems with the quality of the installed base of the target company s products  problems associated with compliance with the target company s existing contracts  difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations  and the diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business 
if we acquire a new business  we may be required to expend significant funds  incur additional debt or issue additional securities  which may negatively affect our operations and be dilutive to our stockholders 
in periods following an acquisition  we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets for impairment 
when such assets are found to be impaired  they will be written down to estimated fair value  with a charge against earnings 
for example  we were required to record impairment charges on acquired intangible assets and goodwill aggregating million in fiscal the failure to adequately address these risks could materially harm our business and financial results 

table of contents failure to retain key personnel could impair our ability to execute our business strategy 
the continuing service of our executive officers and essential engineering  technical and management personnel  together with our ability to attract and retain such personnel  is an important factor in our continuing ability to execute our strategy 
there is substantial competition to attract such employees and the loss of any such key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
the same could be true if we were to experience a high turnover rate among engineering and technical personnel and we were unable to replace them 
risks relating to our customers we face substantial competition which may lead to price pressure and otherwise adversely affect our sales 
we face substantial competition throughout the world in each of our product areas 
our primary competitors are asyst shinko  daifuku  camstar  datasweep  intercim  ibm  murata  rorze  tdk and yaskawa and other smaller  regional companies 
we also endeavor to sell products to oem manufacturers  such as applied materials  novellus  kla tencor and tel  that satisfy their semiconductor and flat panel display handling needs internally rather than by purchasing systems or modules from a supplier like us 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing and customer support capabilities than we do 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products and technologies that could adversely affect sales of our current and future products and services 
new products and technologies developed by our competitors or more efficient production of their products could require us to make significant price reductions to avoid losing orders 
if we fail to respond adequately to pricing pressures or fail to develop products with improved performance or developments with respect to the other factors on which we compete  we could lose customers or orders 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our business and prospects could be materially harmed 
because we rely on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our revenues  the loss of one or more of these customers could materially harm our business 
we receive a significant portion of our revenues in each fiscal period from a relatively limited number of customers  and that trend is likely to continue 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our total revenues in the fiscal year ended september   of our total revenues in fiscal  and in fiscal as the semiconductor manufacturing industry continues to consolidate and further shifts to foundries which manufacture semiconductors designed by others  the number of our potential customers could decrease  which would increase our dependence on our limited number of customers 
the loss of one or more of these major customers or a decrease in orders from one of these customers could materially affect our revenue  business and reputation 
because of the lengthy sales cycles of many of our products  we may incur significant expenses before we generate any revenues related to those products 
our customers may need several months to test and evaluate our products 
this increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change plans  which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer 
the impact of this risk can be magnified during the periods in which we introduce a number of new products  as has been the case during fiscal as a result of this lengthy sales cycle  we may incur significant research and development expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses before we generate the related revenues for these products  and we may never generate the anticipated revenues if our customer cancels or changes its plans 
in addition  many of our products will not be sold directly to the end user but will be components of other products 
as a result  we rely on oems of our products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be incorporated into their equipment at the design stage  so called design ins 
the oem s decisions often 
table of contents precede the generation of volume sales  if any  by a year or more 
moreover  if we are unable to achieve these design ins from oems  we would have difficulty selling our products to that oem because changing suppliers involves significant cost  time  effort and risk on the part of that oem 
customers generally do not make long term commitments to purchase our products and our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time 
sales of our products are often made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long term commitments and contracts 
our customers frequently do not provide any assurance of minimum or future sales and are not prohibited from purchasing products from our competitors at any time 
accordingly  we are exposed to competitive pricing pressures on each order 
our customers also engage in the practice of purchasing products from more than one manufacturer to avoid dependence on sole source suppliers for certain of their needs 
the existence of these practices makes it more difficult for us to gain new customers and to win repeat business from existing customers 
other risks claims of infringement involving one or more of our products in a case pending in a us federal court could result in significant expense 
on or about april   brooks was served with a third party complaint seeking to join brooks as a party to a patent lawsuit brought by an entity named information technology innovation  llc based in northbrook  illinois iti against motorola  inc motorola and freescale semiconductor  inc freescale 
iti began the lawsuit against motorola in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois eastern division in november  and iti added freescale to the lawsuit in march iti claims that motorola and freescale have infringed a us patent that iti asserts covers processes used to model a semiconductor manufacturing plant 
freescale alleges that brooks has a duty to indemnify freescale and motorola from any infringement claims asserted against them based on their use of brooks autosched software program by paying all costs and expenses and all or part of any damages that either of them might incur as a result of the suit brought by iti 
autosched is a software program sold by brooks and by one or more companies that formerly owned the autosched product prior to the acquisition of autosched by brooks in from daifuku usa  inc brooks believes that iti is not a company that is engaged in the business of manufacturing hardware or software products 
it is a limited liability company that apparently acquired an exclusive license to the patent at issue in the litigation and is now in the business of seeking to license the patent to others 
brooks believes that it has meritorious defenses to any claim that brooks autosched product infringes the patent identified by iti in its suit against motorola and freescale  and brooks will contest any such claim 
brooks also believes that meritorious defenses exist to the claims asserted by iti against motorola and freescale  and brooks intends to cooperate fully with motorola and freescale in the defense of those claims 
in any such matter there can be no assurance as to the outcome  and for the reasons described in the contingency section of note  the iti litigation could have a material adverse effect on brooks 
we may be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights  or demands that we license third party technology  which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology 
we rely upon patents  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  copyrights  trademarks and licensing agreements to protect our technology 
due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the semiconductor and flat panel display process equipment industries  we believe that the improvement of existing technology  reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know how and the development of new products may be as important as patent protection in establishing and maintaining competitive advantage 
to protect trade secrets and know how  it is our policy to require all technical and management personnel to 
table of contents enter into nondisclosure agreements 
we cannot guarantee that these efforts will meaningfully protect our trade secrets 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the semiconductor related industries 
we have in the past been  and may in the future be  notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by other third parties 
we cannot guarantee that infringement claims by third parties or other claims for indemnification by customers or end users of our products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions  if proven to be true  will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
particular elements of our technology could be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights or patents of others 
other companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or otherwise claim proprietary rights to technology necessary to our business 
for example  twice in and once in we received notice from general signal corporation that it believed that certain of our tool automation products infringed general signal s patent rights 
we believe the matters identified in the notice from general signal were also the subject of a dispute between general signal and applied materials  inc  which was settled in november there are also claims that have been made by asyst technologies inc that certain products we acquired through acquisition embody intellectual property owned by asyst 
to date no action has been instituted against us directly by general signal  applied materials or asyst 
we cannot predict the extent to which we might be required to seek licenses or alter our products so that they no longer infringe the rights of others 
we also cannot guarantee that the terms of any licenses we may be required to seek will be reasonable 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical and could detract from the value of our products 
if a judgment of infringement were obtained against us  we could be required to pay substantial damages and a court could issue an order preventing us from selling one or more of our products 
further the cost and diversion of management attention brought about by such litigation could be substantial  even if we were to prevail 
any of these events could result in significant expense to us and may materially harm our business and our prospects 
our failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future operations 
our ability to compete is significantly affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property 
existing trade secret  trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection  and certain of our patents could be invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not fully protect our products 
we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of our technology 
other companies could independently develop similar or superior technology without violating our intellectual property rights 
in the future  it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
this could require us to incur significant expenses and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations 
if the site of the majority of our manufacturing operations were to experience a significant disruption in operations  our business could be materially harmed 
most of our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in one location 
if the operations of these facilities were disrupted as a result of a natural disaster  fire  power or other utility outage  work stoppage or other similar event  our business could be seriously harmed because we may be unable to manufacture and ship products and parts to our customers in a timely fashion 
our business could be materially harmed if one or more key suppliers fail to deliver key components 
we currently obtain many of our key components on an as needed  purchase order basis from numerous suppliers 
we do not generally have long term supply contracts with these suppliers  and many of them have 
table of contents undertaken cost containment measures in light of the recent downturn in the semiconductor industry 
in the event of an industry upturn these suppliers could face significant challenges in delivering components on a timely basis 
our inability to obtain components in required quantities or of acceptable quality could result in delays or reductions in product shipments to our customers 
in addition  if a supplier or sub supplier alters their manufacturing processes suffers a production stoppage for any reason or modifies or discontinues their products  this could result in a delay or reduction in product shipments to our customers 
any of the contingencies could cause us to lose customers  result in delayed or lost revenue and otherwise materially harm our business 
we are exposed to potential risks and we will continue to incur increased costs as a result of the internal control testing and evaluation process mandated by section of the sarbanes oxley act of we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september  and assessed all deficiencies on both an individual basis and in combination to determine if  when aggregated  they constitute more than a significant deficiency 
as a result of this evaluation  no material weaknesses were identified 
although we have completed the documentation and testing of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for fiscal  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we expect to continue to incur costs  including increased accounting fees and increased staffing levels  in order to maintain compliance with that section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we continue to monitor controls on an ongoing basis in fiscal for any deficiencies 
no evaluation can provide complete assurance that our internal controls will detect or uncover all failures of persons within our company to disclose material information otherwise required to be reported 
the effectiveness of our controls and procedures could also be limited by simple errors or faulty judgments 
in addition  if we continue to expand globally  the challenges involved in implementing appropriate internal controls will increase and will require that we continue to improve our internal controls 
in the future  if we fail to complete the sarbanes oxley evaluation in a timely manner  we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls 
in addition  any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
recently completed and future acquisitions of companies  some of which may have operations outside the united states  may provide us with challenges in implementing the required processes  procedures and controls in our acquired operations 
acquired companies may not have disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting that are as thorough or effective as those required by securities laws in the united states 
although we intend to devote substantial time and incur substantial costs  as necessary  to ensure ongoing compliance  we cannot be certain that we will be successful in complying with section our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely 
since the beginning of fiscal year through the end of fiscal year  our stock price fluctuated between a high of per share and a low of per share 
the market price of our common stock reached a low of approximately on april  consequently  the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices  and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock 
factors affecting our stock price may include variations in operating results from quarter to quarter  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or our failure to meet analysts expectations  changes in the market price per share of our public company customers  market conditions in the semiconductor industry or the industries upon which it depends  general economic conditions  
table of contents political changes  hostilities or natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods  low trading volume of our common stock  and the number of firms making a market in our common stock 
in addition  the stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high technology companies like ours 
these market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
provisions in our organizational documents  contracts and convertible subordinated notes may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  contracts and convertible subordinated notes due contain provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our securities  including the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent  the elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors to be considered at any meeting of stockholders  a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least percent of our shares be obtained for certain actions requiring the vote of our stockholders  a requirement under our shareholder rights plan that  in many potential takeover situations  rights issued under the plan become exercisable to purchase our common stock at a price substantially discounted from the then applicable market price of our common stock  and a requirement upon specified types of change of control that we repurchase the convertible subordinated notes at a price equal to of the principal outstanding amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
we will incur significant stock based compensation charges related to certain stock options and restricted stock in future periods 
the financial accounting standards board fasb issued in december statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  an amendment of fasb statements nos 
and  that addresses the accounting treatment for employee stock options and other share based payment transactions 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses 
the statement and the change in accounting treatment will result in our reporting increased operating expenses beginning for our next fiscal quarter ending december   which would decrease any reported net income or increase any reported net loss  and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in fiscal  we expect that the stock based compensation cost will have a material effect on our net income as a result of the adoption of statement r

we restrict our investments to repurchase agreements with major banks  us government and corporate securities  and mutual funds that invest in us government securities  which are subject to minimal credit and market risk 
our customers are concentrated in the semiconductor industry  and relatively few customers account for a significant portion of our revenues 
our top ten largest customers accounted for of revenues for the fiscal year ended september  our top twenty largest customers account for of revenues for the fiscal year ended september  we regularly monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and believe that we have adequately provided for exposure to potential credit losses 
interest rate exposure at september   we had no variable interest rate debt  accordingly  a change in the effective interest rate percentage would impact interest income although it would not materially affect the consolidated results of operations or financial position 
currency rate exposure our foreign revenues are generally denominated in united states dollars 
accordingly  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a significant impact on the comparison of the results of operations for the periods presented 
the costs and expenses of our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
however  since the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency  foreign currency translation adjustments do not impact operating results  but instead is reflected as a component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
to the extent that we expand our international operations or change our pricing practices to denominate prices in foreign currencies  we will be exposed to increased risk of currency fluctuation 
assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries are translated at period end exchange rates 
as such  foreign currency fluctuation results in increases and decreases in translated foreign currency assets and liabilities with the resulting offset being reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss
