while ethanol demand continues to drive corn usage higher  ending inventories for corn are expected to remain high 
the overall growing conditions for farmers throughout most of the united states remained favorable

the combination of these factors and higher costs for energy  fertilizer and other farm inputs contributed to reduced demand for products such as irrigation equipment  which represent substantial capital expenditures 
international irrigation revenues remained flat in fiscal at million compared to million in fiscal the acquisition of stettyn  the irrigation company in south africa  in the fourth quarter of fiscal contributed additional revenues during the year 
this increase in revenue was partially offset by many of the same factors affecting domestic sales of irrigation equipment  including the negative effects of depressed agricultural commodity prices

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market value of the company s investment securities fluctuates inversely with movements in interest rates because all of these investment securities bear interest at fixed rates 
accordingly  during periods of rising interest rates  the market value of these securities will decline 
however  the company does not consider itself to be subject to material market risks with respect to its portfolio of investment securities because the maturity of these securities is relatively short  making their value less susceptible to interest rate fluctuations 
the company has manufacturing operations in the united states  france  brazil  and south africa 
the company has sold products throughout the world and purchases certain of its components from third party foreign suppliers 
export sales made from the united states are principally us dollar denominated 
accordingly  these sales are not subject to significant currency translation risk 
however  a majority of the company s revenue generated from operations outside the united states is denominated in local currency 
the company s most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the euro  brazilian real  and the south african rand in relation to the us dollar 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies create exposures which can adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company attempts to manage its transactional foreign exchange exposure by monitoring foreign currency cash flow forecasts and commitments arising from the settlement of receivables and payables  and from future purchases and sales 
the company s translation exposure resulting from translating the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars is not hedged 
the most significant translation exposures are the euro  brazilian real  and the south african rand in relation to the us dollar
