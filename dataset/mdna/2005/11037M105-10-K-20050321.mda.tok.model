item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three years ended december  has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
overview we provide non standard private passenger automobile insurance and related services 
non standard automobile insurance provides coverage to drivers who find it difficult to purchase automobile insurance from standard carriers as a result of a number of factors  including their driving record  vehicle  age  claims history  or because they have limited financial resources 
typically  these drivers purchase minimal levels of insurance coverage in order to comply with state mandated financial responsibility laws 
for comparable coverage  premiums for non standard automobile insurance policies are generally higher than for standard or preferred automobile insurance policies 
we offer insurance coverage exclusively through independent agents and brokers  which number in excess of  because some of our agents and brokers operate from multiple locations  our products are offered at more than  locations 
we are licensed to provide insurance in states and the district of columbia  although we focus our operations in states that we believe provide significant opportunity for profitable growth 
our markets include california  florida and texas  the three largest non standard automobile insurance markets in the united states 
these three states were our first  second  and fifth largest states by premium volume and accounted for of our gross premiums written for the year ended december  in addition to the premiums we charge for our insurance policies  we receive fees for policy issuance  installment payment processing and other items that  in total  aggregate approximately of premiums 
our revenues are derived principally from the following net premiums earned  which comprises the premiums we earn from sales of non standard automobile insurance policies minus those premiums that we cede to our reinsurers  net investment income we earn on our invested assets  policy service fee revenues  which are composed primarily of policy origination fees and installment fees billed to our policyholders  and other income  which primarily represents commission income we earn through a general agency we own in texas 
our expenses consist predominately of the following losses and loss adjustment expenses  including estimates for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred during the period and changes in estimates from prior periods  less the portion of those insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses that we ceded to our reinsurers  commissions and other underwriting expenses  which consist of commissions we pay to agents and brokers  premium taxes and company expenses related to the production and underwriting of insurance policies  less ceding commissions that we receive under our reinsurance contracts  other operating and general expenses  which include general and administrative expenses  depreciation and other expenses  and interest expense under our bank credit facility 
in february  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of the company s common stock 
the company sold  shares providing net proceeds to the company  after deducting issuance costs  of approximately million 
the company contributed million of the proceeds to its principal insurance subsidiary  which increased its statutory surplus 
operating results key states we believe that market conditions in the states in which we operate are becoming generally more competitive but to varying degrees  depending upon the state 
we are seeing few rate filings where companies are raising rates  and in several states  companies with which we compete have filed rate decreases 
in addition  primarily in california  some companies with which we compete have relaxed underwriting standards thereby reducing the premium they charge to consumers and increasing the attractiveness of their product relative to ours 
most companies  bristol west included  are operating profitably at current rate levels 
this contrasts with market conditions during  and when most market participants were seeking rate increases to restore profitability 
the table below shows our gross written premium by state 
in the aggregate  our gross written premium grew by in compared to included in these figures is a change in the provision for expected policy cancellations that increased gross written premiums by for the year ended december  and decreased gross written premiums by less than for the year ended the purpose of the provision is to reduce the balance of installment premiums due from policyholders as reflected in the company s balance sheet to the amount the company expects to ultimately earn 
likewise  the company s liability for unearned premiums related to the installment premiums is reduced to reflect expected policy cancellations related to such non payments 
the provision was reduced which increases both premiums receivable and unearned premiums to reflect an underlying improvement in the company s cancellation experience throughout  as well as a more precise measurement of the expected dollar amount of future cancellations 
the change in estimate added million to gross written premium during and a similar amount to reported unearned premiums and premiums receivable 
the company believes the reduction in policy cancellations emanates from several factors point of sale underwriting resulting in fewer up rates and therefore less cancellations  increased use of electronic funds transfer by our policyholders  the ability to receive telephone and web payments from our policyholders and generally less shopping by consumers 
exclusive of the change in the provision for cancellations  gross written premiums increased by and for the years ended december  and december   respectively  to million compared to million for the comparable period of  and million for the comparable period of most of our growth  in the aggregate  results from an increase in the number of policies in force 
policies in force increased to approximately  as of december  from  as of december  years ended december  change change state dollars in millions california florida michigan south carolina texas pennsylvania maine new hampshire georgia virginia all other includes states total change in expected policy cancellation provision n m n m total  net of change in expected policy cancellation provision one aspect of our growth strategy is to increase the number of producers with which we do business 
we attempt to target producers in geographic areas where we are under represented and where we believe we can write profitable business 
during  we increased our total number of producers to more than  and our total number of producer locations to more than  california continues to be our largest state  and california  florida and michigan accounted for of our volume for growth rates  as enumerated above  vary significantly by state and are dependent upon a variety of factors  including competitive conditions and regulatory environments within those states  our strategies with respect to product pricing and the number and location of producers 
in california  our writings declined by in and grew by in in our other states  in the aggregate  our writings grew by and in and  respectively 
our mix of premium writings is becoming more geographically diversified as we derived of our written premiums from california in  down from in exclusive of the change in the provision for cancellations  we experienced a decline in direct premium written in california of for the year ended december  in california  competitors filed rates remain stable  however  many have relaxed underwriting standards by not verifying mileage bands and other underwriting information  such as driving experience 
this behavior results in lower policy premium for consumers  making it more difficult for companies not engaging in such practices to attract new customers 
we have not relaxed our underwriting standards and do not intend to in the future  as we believe some of these competitors are underwriting these risks at an economic loss 
our direct written premium in california grew in early  and then declined in the latter half of the year 
by quarter  the direct written premium  excluding the change in expected policy cancellation provision  was as follows for and california direct written premiums dollars in millions quarter ended change march june september december we have increased the number of producers in california to with  locations at december  from producers with  locations at december   an increase of producer locations of 
our strategy remains to increase the number of producers  without over saturating the market 
we closely monitor the behavior of our new producers to ensure adherence to our underwriting standards 
in florida  our second largest state  gross written premium grew by for the year ended december  as compared to in april  we introduced a new product design  with a rating structure that utilizes a significantly larger number of rating variables than did its predecessor 
this product has been well received in the market  and we are pleased with the increase in new business volume 
our producer count in florida has increased to  producers and  locations as of december  up from producers with locations as of december  competition has increased in florida  manifested by modest rate reductions  increased advertising and agent incentives 
overall  we view this market as stable and the competition we are seeing as rational 
we have taken significant steps to combat insurance fraud in florida 
we investigate and report suspicious claims and have worked with federal  state and local authorities 
during  we adopted underwriting rule restrictions in certain counties with a high level of suspicious claims 
at the end of  we removed these restrictions after implementing a rate filing that increased rates for these problematic risks 
we have experienced very strong growth in michigan where our premium volume for the year ended december  increased as compared to our strategy in michigan and elsewhere is to grow by increasing the number of producers in profitable geographic areas where we are under represented 
at december   we had producers that had locations up from producers with locations at december  the company s premiums decreased by in georgia to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the comparable period of the georgia legislature approved the use of credit score as a rating variable in july the company made a rate filing using credit score as a rating variable in june the georgia department of insurance has not approved the filing 
consequently  we have curtailed our writings in georgia to those risks we believe we can write profitably without employing credit as a rating variable 
operations we continue to stress productivity gains  and staff count has remained virtually unchanged at  as of march  as compared to  as of march   while policy count has grown by and direct written premiums have grown by in as compared to we continue to monitor our staffing levels in relation to volume in our claims and policyholder services operations 
in addition  we use a number of metrics to track performance  and  generally  performance is meeting or exceeding our internal benchmarks 
we have modified rates times this year 
only one such modification was a decrease 
this was in wisconsin  a state we entered in mid  where we were too conservative in setting rates initially 
we plan to continue to seek rate increases in states where necessary to stay ahead of loss cost trends 
in addition  we believe we can continue to improve our product structure by filing class plan changes that  through segmentation  are designed to attract certain risks that we have found to be superior versus the overall market in a given state 
in the aggregate  we utilized point of sale underwriting on of new business applications in the fourth quarter of policy issuance is now immediate in the states where point of sale underwriting technology  onestep or onestep raptor  has been deployed  compared to an average of days prior to implementation of point of sale underwriting 
in  we continued to roll out onestep in california 
as of december   it was deployed in all brokerage locations in california  and as of march  virtually all california new business applications were being processed on onestep 
we now have point of sale underwriting systems deployed in states 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements 
as additional information becomes available  these estimates and assumptions are subject to change and thus impact amounts reported in the future 
we have identified three accounting policies that we consider to be critical due to the amount of judgment and uncertainty inherent in the application of these policies 
estimation of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
our actuarial staff reviews our insurance subsidiaries loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
when estimating our liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of our insurance policies  we rely heavily on our historical loss and loss adjustment expense experience 
we periodically adjust our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for changes in product mix  underwriting standards and rules  loss cost trends and other factors 
our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves may also be impacted by factors such as the rate of inflation  claims settlement patterns and legislative activities and litigation trends  which we incorporate into our analyses 
as our experience develops or additional information becomes known  we increase or decrease our loss and loss adjustment expense reserve levels  as necessary 
these changes to our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are reflected in our results of operations in the period in which our estimates change 
ultimately  our actual losses and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the estimates we have recorded 
at each financial reporting date  we record our best estimate  which is a point estimate  of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  gross and net of reinsurance 
in selecting the best estimate  we utilize up to different actuarial methodologies 
each of these methodologies is designed to forecast the number of claims we will be called upon to pay and the amounts we will pay on average to settle those claims 
in arriving at our best estimate  our actuaries consider the likely predictive value of the various loss development methodologies employed in light of underwriting practices  premium rate changes and claim settlement practices that may have occurred  and weight the credibility of each methodology 
our actuarial methodologies take into account various factors  including  but not limited to  paid losses  liability estimates for reported losses  paid allocated loss adjustment expenses  salvage and other recoveries received  reported claim counts  open claim counts and counts for claims closed with and without payment of loss 
in establishing our best estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  we determine the number of claims that have been reported as of the financial reporting date and make an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us as of that date 
because our evaluations are based upon historical patterns  if the rate of claims reported to us or paid by us differs from our historical patterns  our evaluations may underestimate the number of claims that will ultimately be paid  and therefore  the amount of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recorded for the period 
in calendar years  and  we experienced adverse development on loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for years prior to each of those calendar years in the amount of million  million and million  respectively 
the most significant factors influencing this development have been the adverse impact of the reorganization of our claims department in and the pricing and product design assumptions we utilized from through in addition  our loss and loss adjustment expense reserve increases related to were adversely impacted as a result of previously exhausting our excess of loss reinsurance coverage 
essentially  we were required to reflect of our continuing adverse development in our income statement due to the exhaustion of that coverage 
if our estimate of gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of million at december  decreases or increases in by one percent  our net income or loss for would decrease or increase by million after tax assuming an effective tax rate of 
since mid  our management team focused on restoring our claims practices  procedures and workflow to historical standards of quickly settling claims 
these improvements continued into  during which time we were continuing to revise our estimates of the impact on loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
in the fourth quarter of  we recruited a new senior vice president of our claims department to continue that process 
in addition  in the course of and  we made numerous improvements to increase the sophistication of our analyses 
these improvements included the following performing all actuarial analyses of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses on a quarterly basis  reviewing loss and loss adjustment expense reserves gross of salvage and subrogation and separately developing estimates of these items to estimate reserves net of salvage and subrogation  increasing the number of analytical methods to include claim count analysis to develop more elaborate estimation methods  and utilizing an automated loss and loss adjustment expense reserving process  virtually eliminating manual spreadsheets 
based on these actions  we believe that we have addressed the issues related to unfavorable development of our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  and that the liabilities that we have recorded for losses and loss adjustment expenses are adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to date 
accruals for litigation 
we continually evaluate potential liabilities and reserves for litigation using the criteria established by statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations we use to estimate our potential liability for litigation are appropriate 
while it is not possible to know with certainty the ultimate outcome of these claims or lawsuits  we believe our existing known litigation is adequately reserved and will not have a material effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
accounting and reporting for reinsurance 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts  we are required to review the contractual terms of all our reinsurance purchases to ensure compliance with that statement 
the statement establishes the conditions required for a contract with a reinsurer to be accounted for as reinsurance and prescribes accounting and reporting standards for those contracts 
the accounting standards depend on whether the contract is long duration or short duration and  if short duration  on whether the contract is prospective or retroactive 
for all reinsurance transactions  immediate recognition of gains is precluded unless our liability to our policyholders is extinguished 
contracts that do not result in the reasonable possibility that the reinsurer may realize a significant loss from the insurance risk assumed generally do not meet the conditions for reinsurance accounting and must be accounted for as deposits 
sfas no 
also requires us to disclose the nature  purpose and effect of reinsurance transactions  including the premium amounts associated with reinsurance assumed and ceded 
it also requires disclosure of concentrations of credit risk associated with reinsurance receivables and prepaid reinsurance premiums 
we believe we have properly accounted for all of our reinsurance contracts 
results of operations twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  revenues gross premiums written 
gross premiums written increased to million for the twelve months ended december   or by  compared to million for the increase is primarily attributable to increased market penetration evidenced by the growth in average policies in force from  for to  for we provide for expected premature policy cancellations in order to adjust premiums written to amounts we expect to ultimately earn 
during  in response to improved persistency of our business  we reduced the provision by million  which added to the growth in our reported gross premiums written for the year 
net premiums written 
net premiums written increased by to million from million in the larger increase in net premiums written as compared to gross premiums written is due to a decrease in the percentage of premiums ceded under our quota share reinsurance treaty from in to in we have entered into a new quota share reinsurance agreement for under which we will be ceding of the premiums on policies written in net premiums earned 
net premiums earned increased by to million in from million in gross earned premiums were up by and our premium retention increased from to as a result of the reduction in the ceding percentage under our quota share reinsurance agreement 
we had a quota share reinsurance agreement in under which we ceded of policy premium  for  we have a new quota share reinsurance agreement under which we will be ceding of the premiums earned on policies written in net investment income and realized capital gains 
net investment income was million in compared to million in most of the increase is attributable to the investment of million of the proceeds from our initial public offering  which took place in mid february  operating cash flows aggregated million for the year  which also contributed to the growth in invested assets and increased net investment income 
the average pre tax equivalent investment yield on the portfolio fell from as of december  to as of year end net realized gains on securities sales were insignificant for the twelve months ended december  compared to million in policy service fee revenues 
policy service fee revenues were million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million or compared to the growth was attributable to the growth in policies in force  since fees are charged on a per policy basis  as well as an increase in the fees we collect on each policy 
the growth in policy service fees was slightly less than the growth in gross earned premiums as our premiums declined in california and grew in other states and the fees we charge related to policy premiums are  on average  higher in california than in the other states in which we operate 
costs and expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses 
losses and loss adjustment expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for our loss ratio losses and loss adjustment expenses divided by net earned premiums  fee income and other income fell to for from for  a decline of points 
the decline in the loss ratio is primarily attributable to a reduction in adverse development on loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for prior years to million in from million in  or points of the improvement 
adverse development occurs when loss and loss adjustment expense reserves established for accidents that took place in years prior to the current year prove to be inadequate and management increases those reserves to reflect the revised estimate of the ultimate losses related to such accidents 
such increases result in a charge to loss and loss adjustment expenses in the current year 
the remainder of the decrease in the loss ratio was due to a point improvement in our claims experience for accident year compared to commissions and other underwriting expenses 
commissions and other underwriting expenses increased to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million or 
the growth was less than the growth in net earned premiums  fees and other income  which increased by 
this category of expenses comprises items such as producers commissions  premium taxes and company expenses that relate to the production of and vary with gross earned premium  reduced by ceding commission income 
in the aggregate  these expenses represented of net earned premiums  fees and other income in down by points from in on a line by line basis direct commission expense was of direct premiums compared to in  ceding commission income was of ceded premiums compared to in  and other underwriting expenses  including premium taxes  were of gross premiums earned compared to in other operating and general expenses 
other operating and general expenses were million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the prior year  an increase of 
the costs of being a public company added approximately million  including an increase of million in our insurance premiums for errors and omissions and directors and officers liability coverage  depreciation increased by million  and bank fees related principally to premium collections increased by million 
litigation expense 
for the year ended december   our consolidated statement of operations included a charge in the amount of million before tax related to two coordinated class actions that alleged  among other things  improper cancellations of our insurance 
see item legal proceedings 
our consolidated statement of operations also included a charge in the amount of million before tax  which increased the overall charge to million for a class action lawsuit  which alleged  among other things  improper classification of our claims adjusters 
as of december   all claimants in that suit had settled 
we recorded no litigation expenses in related to the two class action lawsuits 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the same period of interest incurred pertains to the company s bank debt  which the company refinanced on february  amortization of deferred financing fees is lower under our new facility  closed in february  than under the prior one 
ratios 
our combined ratio was for the twelve months ended december   compared to for  an improvement of points 
the reduction in adverse development accounted for points of the improvement  the current accident year loss ratio for was points lower than in  and the overall expense ratio increased by in compared to our combined ratio is significantly affected by our reinsurance treaties 
we ceded and of our gross written premiums in and  respectively 
the following table provides information about our combined ratio before and after reinsurance for and twelve months ended december  ratio change gross loss ratio gross expense ratio gross combined ratio effect of reinsurance net combined ratio  as reported we have entered into a new quota share reinsurance agreement for under which we will be ceding of the premiums on policies written in as a result  our net combined ratio in will be less affected by reinsurance 
income taxes 
income taxes for the year ended december  were million  or of income before income taxes 
our effective tax rate of comprises federal income taxes and state income taxes 
twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  revenues gross premiums written 
gross premiums written increased to million for the twelve months ended december   or by  compared to million for all of the increase is primarily attributable to increased market penetration evidenced by the growth in average policies in force from  for to  for and an increase in average premium per policy of 
net premiums written 
net premiums written increased by to million from million in the smaller increase in net premiums written as compared to gross premiums written is due to our decision to increase the percentage of premiums ceded under our quota share reinsurance agreement from in to in in order to manage the net retained business in relation to our financial resources 
net premiums earned 
net premiums earned increased by to million from million in  generally in line with the increase in net premiums written 
net investment income and realized capital gains 
net investment income was million compared to million last year 
net realized gains on securities sales were million for the year ended december  compared to million policy service fee revenues 
policy service fee revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to the growth was attributable to the growth in policies in force  since fees are charged on a per policy basis  as well as an increase in the fees we collect on each policy 
costs and expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses 
losses and loss adjustment expenses were essentially unchanged from the prior year at million for compared to million for our loss ratio fell to for from for  a decline of points 
most of the reduction points was due to a decrease to million in from million in in the adverse development of our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for prior years 
the figure comprised million of loss reserve development and million of loss adjustment expense reserve development 
adverse development occurs when loss and loss adjustment expense reserves established for accidents that took place in years prior to the current year prove to be inadequate and management increases those reserves to reflect the revised estimate of the ultimate losses related to such accidents 
such increases result in a charge to loss and loss adjustment expenses in the current year 
the remainder of the decrease in the loss ratio was due to slightly improved loss experience on current business in compared to commissions and other underwriting expenses 
commissions and other underwriting expenses increased to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for twelve months ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in gross premiums drove an increase in amounts paid to agents and brokers and premium taxes 
in addition  ceding commissions earned for the year ended december  decreased to as a percentage of ceded earned premiums from for  which also contributed to the growth in commissions and other underwriting expenses 
other operating and general expenses 
other operating and general expenses were million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the prior year  an increase of 
the increase was due to the expanded scope of operations to support our growing book of business 
this growth  while greater than that of our net premium and fee revenue after reinsurance  was about points less than the growth of our direct premiums and fees 
the scale of our direct business drives our need for staff and facilities  and we evaluate our expense growth relative to that measure 
litigation expense 
litigation expenses related to two class action lawsuits were million in and million in for the year ended december   our consolidated statement of operations included a charge in the amount of million before tax related to two coordinated class actions that alleged  among other things  improper cancellations of our insurance policies and a pending related action 
this amount reflected our estimate of the ultimate costs with respect to these actions  which includes the expected class member payments  defense costs and other expenses associated with these lawsuits and the change in the law related to cancellations 
see item legal proceedings 
for the year ended december   our consolidated statement of operations included a charge in the amount of million before tax  which increased the overall charge to million for a class action  which alleged  among other things  improper classification of our claims adjusters 
million of the overall charge related to this class action was recorded in the million increase in our estimate was due to new facts that emerged as we processed claims forms that were submitted as required by our settlement agreement 
the total amount reflected our estimate of the ultimate costs associated with this action  which include expected class member payments  plaintiff attorney fees and other related expenses 
as of december   all claimants had settled 
ratios 
our combined ratio was for the twelve months ended december   compared to for  an improvement of points 
the reduction in adverse development accounted for points of the improvement  the remainder is the result of a slight improvement in current year loss experience compared to that of the prior year 
our combined ratio exclusive of the effect of adverse reserve development was in compared to in  an improvement of points 
income taxes 
income taxes for the year ended december  were million  or of income before income taxes 
our effective tax rate was comprised of federal income taxes and state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources we are organized as a holding company with all of our operations being conducted by our insurance subsidiaries  which underwrite the risks associated with our insurance policies  and our non insurance subsidiaries  which provide our policyholders and our insurance subsidiaries a variety of services related to the insurance policies we provide 
we have continuing cash needs for the payment of principal and interest on borrowings  dividends on common stock  taxes and administrative expenses 
these ongoing obligations are funded with dividends from our non insurance subsidiaries and taxes are paid by each subsidiary through an inter company tax allocation agreement 
in february  an initial public offering of  shares of the company s common stock was completed 
the company sold  shares providing net proceeds to the company  after deducting issuance costs  of approximately million 
the company contributed million of the proceeds to its insurance subsidiaries  which increased their statutory surplus 
in february  the company completed a refinancing of its secured credit facility  which had an outstanding balance of million at the time of the refinancing 
the new bank agreement bank agreement consists of a million secured revolving credit facility  which includes up to million for letters of credit and matures in  a million term a loan  which matures in  and a million term b loan  which matures in the company s interest rate on borrowings under the bank agreement is london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin to  which is determined based on the company s consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization ratio  as defined in the bank agreement 
the company also pays certain commitment fees 
the bank agreement is secured by a pledge of stock of certain of the company s subsidiaries 
the refinancing extended the maturity of the company s debt coming due in through the bank agreement requires compliance with certain financial loan covenants related to leverage and debt service coverage 
as of  and for the twelve month period ended december   the company was in compliance with all such covenants 
there are no restrictions on the payment of dividends by our non insurance subsidiaries other than customary state corporation laws regarding solvency 
dividends from our insurance subsidiaries are subject to limitations based upon statutory surplus and earnings 
see item business regulatory matters 
as of december   our insurance subsidiaries could pay dividends of million without seeking regulatory approval 
our insurance subsidiaries have not paid any dividends since  which has not impacted our ability to meet our obligations 
because our non insurance subsidiaries generate revenues  profits and net cash flows that are generally unrestricted as to their availability for the payment of dividends  we expect to use those revenues to service all of our corporate financial obligations  such as debt service and stockholder dividends 
our insurance subsidiaries primary sources of funds are premiums received  investment income and proceeds from the sale and redemption of investment securities 
our non insurance subsidiaries primary source of funds is policy service fee revenues 
our subsidiaries use funds to pay claims and operating expenses  make payments under the tax allocation agreement  purchase investments and pay dividends to us 
after the company s initial public offering in february  the company began paying quarterly dividends of per share for a total dividend payout of million during the year ended december  the declaration and payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors  and depends on  among other things  our financial condition  results of operations  capital and cash requirements  future prospects  regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries  restrictions under our credit facility on our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and other factors deemed relevant by the board

in addition we paid million in litigation costs in compared to million in net cash used in investment activities amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and was used principally to purchase fixed income securities 
the increase in investment purchases from to was due to the investment of proceeds from the company s initial public offering that was completed in february the decrease in cash used in investment activities in compared to was due to the reduction in cash flow from operations as noted above 
property  software and equipment additions were million  million  and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures during were predominantly for computer equipment and software 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities from to was due to the company s initial public offering proceeds of million as noted above with regard to the increase in investment purchases 
for the years ended december  and  we paid million and million  respectively  in federal and state income taxes 
we paid no federal income taxes during the year ended december  as a result of a million taxable loss on our federal consolidated income tax return for the year ended december  the loss reported in was carried forward  applied against and completely offset our consolidated taxable income for the company elected to terminate and commute the to quota share reinsurance agreement on a cut off basis effective january  the termination and commutation resulted in the reinsurers release from all future liability in return for settlement of all balances due the company of million  which was received on january  these monies have been invested in high quality fixed income securities 
the commutation resulted in significant increases decreases in certain balance sheet accounts in  as follows cash reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses prepaid reinsurance ceding commission receivable reinsurance payables deferred policy acquisition costs  the company ceded significant premiums and losses to its reinsurers under this agreement in  and  as shown in the following table

the company has elected to cede of business written during under this agreement 
on march   the company announced that its board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s outstanding common stock 
under this program  share purchases may be made from time to time in the open market depending on share price  market conditions  and other factors 
we plan to utilize internally generated funds as the funding source for the common stock repurchase program 
we believe that existing cash and investment balances  together with anticipated future cash flows generated from operations will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs

effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations  except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates and claim costs 
the effects of inflation are also considered in pricing and in estimating reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses 
the actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled 
in addition to general price inflation  we are exposed to a persisting long term upward trend in the cost of judicial awards for damages 
we make every effort to take this into account in our pricing and establishing loss and loss adjustment expense reserves

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that we are principally exposed to two types of market risk interest rate risk and credit risk 
interest rate risk investments 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of debt securities  all of which are classified as available for sale 
accordingly  the primary market risk exposure to our debt securities portfolio is interest rate risk  which we strive to limit by managing duration to a defined range of three to four years and laddering or utilizing an even distribution in the maturities of the securities we purchase to achieve our duration target 
interest rate risk includes the risk from movements in the underlying market rate and in the credit spread of the respective sectors of the debt securities held in our portfolio 
the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio is directly impacted by changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income portfolio falls  and the converse is also true 
we expect to manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration  yield and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our liabilities 
the effective duration of the portfolio as of december  was years 
should market interest rates increase  our fixed income portfolio would be expected to decline in market value by million  or 
conversely  a decline in interest rates would result in an million  or  appreciation in the market value of our fixed income portfolio 
these market value changes are a result of the effective duration of the portfolio  as well as the slightly negative convexity of the portfolio 
credit facility 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates also relates to the interest expense of variable rate debt under a bank credit agreement that we entered into on february  the credit agreement is a floating rate borrowing facility and the interest rate we pay increases or decreases with the changes in interest rates  specifically libor 
based on our borrowings under the floating rate credit agreement at march   a increase in market interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by approximately  credit risk investments 
an additional exposure to our debt securities portfolio is credit risk 
we attempt to manage our credit risk through issuer and industry diversification 
we regularly monitor our overall investment results and review compliance with our investment objectives and guidelines 
our investment guidelines include limitations on the minimum rating of debt securities in our investment portfolio  as well as restrictions on investments in debt securities of a single issuer 
all of the debt securities in our portfolio were rated investment grade by the national association of insurance commissioners  or the naic  and standard poor s as of december  reinsurance 
we are subject to credit risks with respect to our reinsurers 
although our reinsurers are liable to us to the extent we cede risk to them  we are ultimately liable to our policyholders on all risks we have reinsured 
as a result  reinsurance agreements do not limit our ultimate obligations to pay claims to policyholders and we may not recover claims made to our reinsurers 
our reinsurers are rated from a to a by am best
