table of contents introduction the following analysis of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of allmerica financial corporation the holding company and subsidiaries afc should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
our results of operations include the accounts of the hanover insurance company hanover and citizens insurance company of america citizens  our principal property and casualty companies 
our results of operations also include the accounts of allmerica financial life insurance and annuity company afliac and first allmerica financial life insurance company faflic  our principal life insurance and annuity companies  and certain other insurance and non insurance subsidiaries 
hanover and citizens are domiciled in the states of new hampshire and michigan  respectively  while afliac and faflic are both domiciled in massachusetts 
executive overview in  we continued to execute our strategies for improving the profitability of our personal lines business and for retaining our profitability in  and growing  our commercial lines business 
during the first quarter  our am best ratings were restored to the a level for our property and casualty companies  which we believe is important for achieving profitable commercial lines growth 
in addition  we completed the process of exiting our broker dealer operations and have focused on managing and reducing our expenses across our life insurance operations 
our statutory capital levels in both our life and property and casualty insurance businesses also improved 
the massachusetts division of insurance approved a million dividend from afliac to the holding company  effective december  during  our segment earnings in the property and casualty business improved compared to the prior year  even though we experienced unusually high catastrophe losses  net of reinsurance 
we benefited from net premium rate increases across our principal product lines in both our personal lines and commercial lines segments 
additionally  we experienced lower non catastrophe loss frequency and favorable development of prior years loss reserves in personal lines  partially offset by a decline in commercial lines earnings 
the decline in commercial lines earnings was primarily attributable to significant catastrophe losses incurred during the third quarter due to several hurricanes  but higher expenses were also a factor 
our results also reflected a significant charge in our other property and casualty segment from an adverse arbitration decision related to a single large property claim within a voluntary insurance pool that we exited in there were no similar charges in segment earnings in our life insurance business were favorably impacted by lower operating expenses as a result of the shut down of our broker dealer operation in  partially offset by higher guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb expense and market related amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
description of operating segments our business includes financial products and services in two major areas property and casualty and life companies 
within these broad areas  we conduct business principally in four operating segments 
these segments are personal lines  commercial lines  other property and casualty  and life companies 
we present the separate financial information of each segment consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates results in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
a summary of our reportable segments and changes in our reportable segments from december  is included below 
the property and casualty group manages its operations principally through three segments personal lines  commercial lines and other property and casualty 
personal lines includes such property and casualty coverages as personal automobile  homeowners and other personal policies  while commercial lines includes such property and casualty coverages as workers compensation  commercial automobile  commercial multiple peril and other commercial policies 
the other property and casualty segment consists of voluntary pools business in which we have not actively participated since  amgro  inc amgro  our premium financing business  opus investment management  inc opus  which markets investment management services to institutions  pension funds and other organizations  and earnings on holding company assets 
prior to  the operating results of amgro and opus were included in our former asset management segment 
the life companies segment consists of the former allmerica financial services segment afs  our guaranteed investment contract gic business formerly a part of the asset management segment  and our discontinued group life and health business  including group life and health voluntary pools the former corporate risk management services segment 
our life companies segment manages a block of existing variable annuity  variable universal life and traditional life insurance products  gics and certain group retirement products 
during  we managed this existing life insurance business and also operated an independent broker dealer business  which distributed third party investment and insurance products 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced the cessation of the retail services of our independent broker dealer  veravest investments  inc veravest 
in addition  this segment actively manufactured and sold variable annuities  variable universal life and traditional life insurance products  as well as our gic products  until the fourth quarter of we report interest expense related to our corporate debt separately from the earnings of our operating segments 
corporate debt consists of our junior subordinated debentures allmerica financial annual report 
table of contents and our senior debentures 
in addition  during  we allocated corporate overhead costs that were previously reported in our former corporate segment to the four operating segments 
all prior periods presented have been restated to reflect the current organization 
results of operations our consolidated net income includes the results of our four operating segments segment income and our interest expense on corporate debt  which we evaluate on a pre tax basis 
in addition  segment income excludes certain items which we believe are not indicative of our core operations 
the income of our segments excludes items such as federal income taxes and net realized investment gains and losses  including net gains or losses on certain derivative instruments  because fluctuations in these gains and losses are determined by interest rates  financial markets and the timing of sales 
also  segment income excludes net gains and losses on disposals of businesses  discontinued operations  restructuring costs  extraordinary items  the cumulative effect of accounting changes and certain other items 
although the items excluded from segment income may be significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance  we believe segment income enhances an investor s understanding of our results of operations by highlighting net income attributable to the normal operations of the business 
however  segment income should not be construed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in addition  as a result of adopting statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity statement no 
in  we reclassified dividends related to the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of a subsidiary trust holding solely our junior subordinated debentures  to interest expense on corporate debt 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information statement no 
 we restated prior periods to reflect this presentation 
our consolidated net income was million in  compared to million in the increase in of million resulted primarily from an million improvement in segment income  partially offset by a million increase in the corresponding federal income tax expense 
also contributing to the increase in net income was a million favorable federal income tax settlement and a million reduction in restructuring costs 
these favorable items were partially offset by an after tax charge of million related to the implementation of statement of position  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts sop 
our consolidated net income was million in  compared to a net loss of million in results in were adversely affected by a loss in the life companies segment of million  primarily as a result of amortization of deferred acquisition costs following the cessation  in the fourth quarter of  of sales of our proprietary annuity and life insurance products 
the increase in over of million  therefore  resulted primarily from a million net improvement in segment income  principally related to our life companies segment  partially offset by a million reduction in the corresponding federal income tax benefit 
also contributing to the increase in net income in was a million change in net realized investment gains losses to a net gain of million from a net loss of million for partially offsetting these increases in net income was a decrease in gains from the retirement of funding agreements and trust instruments supported by funding obligations of million and a change of million in losses gains on derivative instruments to a net loss of million in from a net gain of million in the following table reflects segment income and a reconciliation to consolidated net income

table of contents segment income compared to our segment income before federal income taxes was million in  compared to million in this improvement is attributable to an increase in the property and casualty group s segment income of million and an increase in life companies segment income of million 
segment results for the property and casualty group include catastrophe losses of million in  compared to million in catastrophe losses were unusually high in due to four hurricanes in the southeast 
during  however  we recorded a charge of million resulting from an adverse arbitration decision related to a single large property claim within a voluntary insurance pool that we exited in excluding this charge and the impact of the increase in catastrophe losses  segment income increased million as compared to the increase in segment income is primarily attributable to an estimated million of improved current accident year loss performance due to net premium rate increases across all principal product lines and to a decrease in non catastrophe claims activity primarily in personal lines 
additionally  development on prior years loss and loss adjustment expense lae reserves improved by million  excluding the pool charge described above  from million of adverse development in to million of favorable development in these favorable items were partially offset by an increase in policy acquisition and other operating expenses of million 
life companies segment results increased million  primarily as the result of million of net expense savings resulting from the cessation of the retail sales operations of veravest and ongoing expense management efforts 
also  million of veravest asset impairments were recorded in there were no similar asset impairments in these favorable items were partially offset by an increase in deferred policy acquisition cost dac amortization of million  primarily due to less favorable equity market returns 
segment results were also lower by million due to lower interest margins on gics  primarily from higher expenses associated with interest rate swaps 
also  net investment income declined million primarily from the replacement of high yield investments with lower yielding  higher quality fixed income securities and lower partnership income 
additionally  the combined effect of derivatives losses associated with the gmdb hedging program and increased gmdb expenses due to the implementation of sop  reduced life companies segment income by million in our federal income tax expense was million for  compared to a benefit of million in this increase in federal income tax expense is primarily related to the higher segment income  as well as lower tax exempt interest in compared to our segment income before federal income taxes was million in  compared to a loss of million in this improvement of million is attributable to an increase of million in segment income from the life companies segment  partially offset by a decrease from the property and casualty group s segment income of million 
life companies segment income in includes charges of million relating to the impairment of assets resulting from our discontinuing the retail operations of veravest 
the loss in our life companies segment reflects net charges of million resulting from the cumulative effect of the decline in equity market values  ratings downgrades and our cessation of proprietary life insurance and annuity product sales see segment results life companies 
these charges include million of additional amortization of the dac asset and million due to a change in the assumptions related to the long term cost of gmdb for variable annuity products  net of the related dac amortization 
in addition  we recognized impairments of capitalized technology costs associated with variable products totaling million 
the million decrease in property and casualty segment income for is primarily attributable to an increase in adverse development of prior years loss and loss adjustment expense reserves of million  including charges of million resulting from the aforementioned adverse arbitration decision 
catastrophe losses increased million in in addition  segment income in decreased due to a million increase in policy acquisition and other operating expenses  as well as a million decrease in net investment income 
these were partially offset by an estimated million improvement in current accident year loss performance primarily due to net premium rate increases 
the federal income tax benefit was million for  compared to a million benefit in the large benefit in is primarily the result of the loss recognized by the life companies segment 
other items during  we recorded income of million relating to a federal income tax settlement for prior years see income taxes 
net realized investment gains  net of taxes and deferred acquisition cost amortization  were million in  primarily due to million of after tax gains from the sale of million of fixed maturities 
partially offsetting these gains were after tax losses of million related to the termination of certain derivative instruments and million of after tax impairments of fixed maturities 
during  net realized investment gains  net of taxes and deferred acquisition cost amortization  were million primarily resulting from allmerica financial annual report 
table of contents million of after tax gains from the sale of approximately billion of fixed maturities 
these gains were partially offset by impairments of million  net of taxes  primarily related to fixed maturities 
during  net realized investment losses  net of taxes and amortization  were million  primarily due to million of fixed maturity impairments  net of taxes  and million of after tax losses related to the termination of certain derivative instruments 
these losses were partially offset by million of after tax net realized gains from the sale of approximately billion of fixed maturities 
net gains losses on derivative instruments  net of taxes  increased million to a gain of million in from a loss of million in in  net gains losses on derivative instruments  net of taxes  decreased million from  to the net loss of million 
the changes in net gains losses on derivative instruments in both and resulted from derivative activity that did not meet the requirements of hedge accounting 
during  we recognized gains on derivatives  net of taxes  of million as a result of the termination of certain derivative instruments  which previously were recognized as ineffective hedges 
in  we retired million of long term funding agreement obligations  resulting in a loss of million  net of taxes as compared with a gain of million in from the retirement of million of long term funding agreement obligations 
in  we recognized a gain of million  net of taxes  on the retirement of million of long term funding agreement obligations 
the gains in and resulted from the retirement of certain long term funding obligations at discounts see significant transactions gain on retirement of funding obligations 
in  we ceased certain sponsored businesses and restructured certain commercial lines operations in our property and casualty group 
in  we ceased our retail operations related to our broker dealer in our life companies segment 
during  we began restructuring efforts in our life companies segment after terminating all new sales of our proprietary life insurance and annuity products 
in  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  net of taxes  primarily as a result of these restructuring efforts 
these restructuring costs consisted of severance and other employee related expenses  as well as the cancellation of certain lease agreements and contracted services 
in addition  we recognized  during  other reorganization costs of million  net of taxes  primarily related to the forgiveness of interest on certain loans to former life companies agents 
during  we recognized income of million  net of taxes  from the settlement of post closing items related to the december sale of our universal life insurance business through a coinsurance agreement see significant transactions sale of universal life business 
in  we recognized a loss of million  net of taxes  related to this transaction 
during  we adopted sop  which resulted in a charge of million  net of taxes 
the charge results from new requirements for recognizing guaranteed minimum death benefit and guaranteed minimum income benefit reserves based on various assumptions  including estimates of future market returns and expected contract persistency 
during  we recognized a million loss  net of taxes  upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no

table of contents segment results the following is our discussion and analysis of the results of operations by business segment 
the segment results are presented before taxes and minority interest and other items which management believes are not indicative of our core operations  including realized gains and losses

during  however  we recorded a charge of million resulting from an adverse arbitration decision related to a single large property claim within a voluntary insurance pool 
we exited this pool in excluding this charge and the impact of the increase in catastrophe losses  segment income increased million as compared to the same period in this increase is primarily attributable to an estimated million of improved current accident year loss performance due to net premium rate increases across all principal product lines and a decrease in non catastrophe claims activity primarily in personal lines 
net premium rate increases reflect rate actions  discretionary pricing adjustments  inflation and changes in exposure  net of the estimated impact of loss inflation and policy acquisition costs 
additionally  development on prior years loss and loss adjustment expense reserves improved million  from million of adverse development for the year ended december   excluding the pool charge described above  to million of favorable development for the year ended december  these favorable items were partially offset by an increase in policy acquisition and other operating expenses of million due to higher contingent commissions  employee related expenses and technology costs 
compared to segment income from our property and casualty group decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the decrease in segment income is primarily attributable to an increase in adverse development on prior years reserves of million  to million of adverse development for the year ended december   from million of adverse development for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a charge of million from an adverse arbitration decision related to a single large property claim within a voluntary insurance pool 
we exited this pool in in addition  prior years workers compensation reserves developed adversely  partially offset by favorable development in commercial multiple peril reserves 
catastrophe losses increased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in catastrophe losses in were unusually low 
additionally  segment income for the year ended december  was negatively affected by a million increase in policy acquisition and other operating expenses  primarily due to an increase in special commission and expenses associated with financial guarantee programs designed to minimize the impact to our commercial lines business from the ratings downgrades in policy acquisition and other operating expenses also increased due to higher employee benefits and technology costs 
net investment income decreased million for the year ended december  compared to partially offsetting these negative items was a benefit from an estimated million of improved current accident year loss performance  primarily due to net premium rate increases across all principal product lines and a decrease in non catastrophe claims activity 
product line results underwriting results are reported using statutory accounting principles  which are prescribed by state insurance regulators 
the primary difference between statutory accounting principles and gaap is the deferral of certain underwriting costs under gaap that are amortized over the life of the policy 
under statutory accounting principles  these costs are recognized when incurred or paid 
we review the operations of this business based upon statutory results 
we manage the property and casualty group s operations through two lines of business based upon product offerings personal lines and commercial lines 
personal lines include personal automobile  homeowners and other personal policies 
commercial lines include workers compensation  commercial automobile  commercial multiple peril and other commercial policies 
in  we reorganized our property and casualty segment see executive overview description of operating allmerica financial annual report 
table of contents segments 
under the new structure  amgro  opus and earnings on the holding company s assets are reported in our other property and casualty segment 
prior to  the operating results of amgro and opus were included in our former asset management segment 
in addition  in  we allocated our corporate overhead costs across all operating segments  including the three segments of our property and casualty group 
prior to  these overhead costs were reported in our former corporate segment 
all prior periods have been restated to reflect the current structure

this ratio is the sum of the ratio of incurred claims and claim expenses to premiums earned and the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred to premiums written 
federal income taxes  net investment income and other non underwriting expenses are not reflected in the statutory combined ratio 
our statutory combined ratios include catastrophe losses  which represented  and of our personal lines  commercial lines and total statutory combined ratios  respectively  for the year ended december    and of our personal lines  commercial lines and total statutory combined ratios  respectively  for the year ended december   and  and of our personal lines  commercial lines and total statutory combined ratios  respectively  for the year ended december  allmerica financial annual report

compared to personal lines personal lines net premiums written decreased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  this was primarily the result of a decrease of million  or  in the personal automobile line  partially offset by an increase of million  or in the homeowners line 
the decrease in the personal automobile line is primarily due to the decline of in policies in force since december  partially offsetting this decrease of policies in force was a rate increase in the personal automobile line 
the increase in the homeowners line resulted primarily from an overall rate increase  partially offset by a decrease in overall policies in force of since december  approximately one half of the decline in policies in force in both lines was the result of our strategies to enhance margins  and in some cases  reduce exposures in certain states where the regulatory structure is challenging  particularly massachusetts and new jersey  where we conduct a significant amount of business 
part of this reduction reflects our exit of certain sponsored market accounts employer and affinity groups that were unprofitable and not well aligned with our strategy 
however  policies in force also declined in many other markets  most significantly in michigan where policies in force decreased since december  we attribute this decline to the introduction of a new product that enhances our ability to segment risks  certain service issues  which management is currently addressing  and rate increases on specific classes of business 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience further declines in our policies in force 
personal lines segment income increased million to million for the year ended december  the increase in segment income is primarily attributable to an estimated million of improved current accident year loss performance 
the improved loss performance is attributable to the favorable effect of net premium rate increases 
also  a decrease in non catastrophe claims activity due to lower frequency in both the personal automobile and homeowners lines favorably impacted segment income 
we believe our improved non catastrophe claims frequency experience is consistent with recent industry trends although we do not know whether these trends are sustainable 
in addition  development on prior years loss and loss adjustment expense reserves improved million  to million of favorable development for the year ended december   compared to million of adverse development in these favorable items were partially offset by an increase in policy acquisition and other operating expenses of million for the year ended december  as compared to  due to higher contingent commissions  employee related expenses and technology costs 
additionally  catastrophe losses increased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in  due to four hurricanes in the southeast 
allmerica financial annual report 
table of contents personal lines net premiums written are expected to be under continued pressure in there are signs of increasing rate competition  and in some states such as massachusetts  new york  and michigan  regulatory pressures 
the massachusetts commissioner of insurance has ordered a reduction in net rates of personal automobile insurance of 
in light of the difficulty of the massachusetts personal automobile regulatory environment  particularly in controlling costs associated with its share of the residual market  we expect to continue to reduce writings in this state 
we also do not expect the same level of rate increases in michigan as we experienced in we currently do not expect to file for meaningful rate increases in michigan in  and we recently adjusted rates downward in the state with the intention of meeting competitive pricing pressures and reducing the decline in policies in force 
in addition  the commissioner of insurance in michigan has adopted a rule banning the use of any form of credit scores in the underwriting or pricing of personal lines products  effective july  if the ban becomes effective as planned  it could have a disruptive impact on the overall market as some consumers experience an increase in premium and some experience a decrease in premium 
the proposed ban could have an adverse effect on retention rates and new business volume  as well as possibly result in a lowering of overall premiums as actions are taken to offset the anticipated lower retention rates and new business volumes 
commercial lines commercial lines net premiums written increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to an overall rate increase in commercial lines since december  commercial lines segment income decreased million to million for the year ended december  the decrease in segment income is primarily attributable to an increase in catastrophe losses of million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in catastrophe losses were unusually high in due to four significant hurricanes in the southeast 
also contributing to the decline in segment income is the increase of million in policy acquisition and other operating expenses for the year ended december  compared to the same period in policy acquisition and other operating expenses increased due to higher contingent commissions  employee related expenses and technology costs 
loss adjustment expenses increased approximately million primarily due to higher employee related expenses  to increased catastrophe activity  and higher litigation activity 
additionally  favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves decreased million  to million of favorable development for the year ended december   compared to million of favorable development for the same period in partially offsetting these unfavorable items was an estimated million in improved current accident year loss performance 
our ability to increase net premiums written and to maintain or improve underwriting results is expected to be affected by increased price competition 
other property and casualty segment results of the other property and casualty segment increased million to million for the year ended december  from a loss of million in prior year segment results included a charge of million resulting from an adverse arbitration decision related to a single large property claim within a voluntary insurance pool 
we exited this pool in compared to personal lines personal lines net premiums written increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  this is primarily the result of an increase of million  or in the homeowners line 
partially offsetting this increase is a decrease of million and million in the other personal and personal automobile lines  respectively 
the increase in the homeowners line is primarily the result of an average rate increase of since december  the decrease in the personal automobile line resulted primarily from a decrease of in policies in force  partially offset by an average rate increase of since december personal lines segment income declined million to million for the year ended december  the decrease in segment income is primarily due to an increase in current accident year loss performance due to an increase in claim frequency and severity due to the harsher winter weather during the first quarter of  especially in the northeast 
in addition  catastrophe losses increased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in also  we experienced an increase in severity of personal automobile medical costs related to personal injury protection coverage in michigan 
segment income was also unfavorably affected by an million increase in adverse development during in the personal automobile line 
personal lines expenses increased due to the increase in commissions  employee benefits and technology costs 
partially offsetting these items is an estimated million of net premium rate increases 
commercial lines commercial lines net premiums written decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of the agency management actions we took in and our continuing re underwriting efforts 
as a result of these actions  policies in force decreased  and in the commercial automobile  workers compensation  and commercial multiple peril lines  respectively  since december  this decrease is allmerica financial annual report 
table of contents also partially due to lower retention rates in certain lines as a result of the ratings downgrades  including attrition with larger accounts 
partially offsetting these items were rate increases in all of the commercial lines since december  commercial lines segment income decreased million to million for the year ended december  the decrease in segment income is primarily attributable to an increase in catastrophe losses of million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in development on prior years reserves declined million to million of favorable development for the year ended december   compared to of favorable development in this decline in commercial lines favorable development is primarily due to adverse development in the workers compensation line  partially offset by favorable development in the commercial multiple peril line 
commercial lines policy acquisition and other operating expenses increased due to higher commissions and the prior year s expenses related to our financial guarantee program  as well as employee benefits and technology costs 
partially offsetting these items is an estimated million of net premium rate increases 
other property and casualty segment results of the other property and casualty segment decreased million to a loss of million for the year ended december  from a profit of million in segment results for included a charge of million resulting from an adverse arbitration decision related to a single large property claim within a voluntary insurance pool 
we exited this pool in investment results net investment income before taxes was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in net investment income in primarily reflects an increase in average invested assets  partially offset by a reduction in average pre tax yields on fixed maturities 
average pre tax yields on fixed maturities decreased to in compared to in due to the lower prevailing fixed maturity investment rates 
we expect our investment results will continue to be negatively affected by the lower prevailing fixed maturity investment rates 
the decrease in net investment income in  compared to  primarily reflects a reduction in average pre tax yields on fixed maturities and an increased emphasis on higher credit quality fixed maturities 
average pre tax yields on fixed maturities decreased to in compared to in due to the lower prevailing fixed maturity investment rates and a shift to higher credit quality fixed maturities 
the decrease in net investment income also reflects a reduction in average invested assets as a result of a million dividend from the property and casualty companies to the holding company in july and a transfer of million in january to fund the property and casualty companies portion of the additional minimum pension liability we recognized at december  reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses overview of loss reserve estimation process we maintain reserves for our property and casualty products to provide for our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these reserves are estimates  involving actuarial projections at a given point in time  of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances then known  estimates of future trends in claim severity and frequency  judicial theories of liability and policy coverage  and other factors 
we determine the amount of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves the loss reserves based on an estimation process that is very complex and uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process is judgmental  and requires us to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims on type of business and nature of claim bases 
using data obtained from this monitoring and assumptions about emerging trends  we develop information about the size of ultimate claims based on historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process  which vary by line of business  include determining the trend in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there are no precise methods  however  for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual development of reserves is affected by many factors  as noted above 
because the amounts of the loss reserves are sensitive to our assumptions  we do not completely rely on only one estimate to determine our loss reserves 
we develop several estimates using generally accepted actuarial projection methodologies that result in various reasonably possible loss reserve outcomes and we adopt an estimate that considers all of the actuarial projection methodologies plus other factors not captured by these methodologies 
regarding voluntary and involuntary pools  we are provided loss estimates by managers of each pool 
we adopt an estimate that considers this information and other factors 
we exercise judgment allmerica financial annual report 
table of contents based upon our knowledge of the property and casualty business  review of the outcome of actuarial studies  historical experience and other factors to record an estimate which reflects our expected ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses 
when trends emerge that we believe affect the future settlement of claims  we adjust our reserves accordingly 
management s review of judgments and key assumptions there is greater inherent uncertainty in estimating insurance reserves for certain types of property and casualty insurance lines  particularly workers compensation and other liability lines  where a longer period of time may elapse before a definitive determination of ultimate liability and losses may be made 
in addition  the technological  judicial  regulatory and political climates involving these types of claims change regularly 
we maintain a practice of significantly limiting the issuance of long tailed other liability policies  including directors and officers d o liability  errors and omissions e o liability and medical malpractice liability 
the industry has experienced recent adverse loss trends in these lines of business 
we regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and further events occur which may impact the resolution of unsettled claims 
reserve adjustments are reflected in results of operations as adjustments to losses and lae 
often these adjustments are recognized in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying policy was written and loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are described as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results and may vary by line of business 
inflation generally increases the cost of losses covered by insurance contracts 
the effect of inflation varies by product 
our property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and lae and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses are known 
consequently  we attempt  in establishing rates and reserves  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in the projection of ultimate costs 
we have experienced increasing medical costs  including those associated with personal automobile personal injury protection claims  particularly in michigan  as well as in our workers compensation line in most states 
this increase is reflected in our reserve estimates  but continued increases could contribute to increased losses and lae in the future 
we regularly review our reserving techniques  our overall reserving position and our reinsurance 
based on i our review of historical data  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in impositions of damages and policy coverage  political attitudes and trends in general economic conditions  ii our review of per claim information  iii our historical loss experience and that of the industry  iv the relatively short term nature of most policies written by us and v our internal estimates of required reserves  we believe that adequate provision has been made for loss reserves 
however  establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that current established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
a significant change to the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
loss reserves by line of business we perform actuarial reviews on certain detailed line of business coverages 
these individual reviews are summarized into six broader lines of business personal automobile  homeowners  workers compensation  commercial automobile  commercial multiple peril  and other lines 
the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending reserve for unpaid losses and lae as follows for the years ended december in millions reserve for losses and lae  beginning of year incurred losses and lae  net of reinsurance recoverable provision for insured events of current year decrease increase in provision for insured events of prior years total incurred losses and lae payments  net of reinsurance recoverable losses and lae attributable to insured events of current year losses and lae attributable to insured events of prior years total payments change in reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses reserve for losses and lae  end of year the table below summarizes the reserve for losses and lae by line of business

table of contents prior year development by line of business when trends emerge that we believe affect the future settlement of claims  we adjust our reserves accordingly 
reserve adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as adjustments to losses and lae 
often  we recognize these adjustments in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are disclosed and discussed separately as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results 
the table below summarizes the change in provision for insured events of prior years by line of business 
for the years ended december in millions decrease increase in loss provision for insured events of prior years personal automobile homeowners and other total personal workers compensation commercial automobile commercial multiple peril other commercial total commercial voluntary pools iri claim increase in loss provision for insured events of prior years decrease in lae provision for insured events of prior years decrease increase in total loss and lae provision for insured events of prior years estimated loss reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed unfavorably by million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the unfavorable loss development during the year ended december  was primarily the result of continued adverse development in the workers compensation line of business related to increased medical costs and long term attendant care 
additionally  adverse loss development was experienced in other commercial lines  primarily in umbrella and general liability  which is primarily the result of increases in estimated ultimate losses for these long tail lines 
partially offsetting these items was favorable loss development in the commercial multiple peril  commercial automobile  homeowners and personal automobile lines of business 
the improvement in loss development on these lines of business is primarily the result of improved claim frequency trends 
the increase in unfavorable loss reserve development during the year ended december  was primarily the result of the million charge from the aforementioned voluntary pool arbitration decision 
additionally  loss reserves for the workers compensation line increased as a result of increasing medical costs 
loss reserve development was also affected by an increase in personal automobile claim severity related to medical settlements in michigan 
partially offsetting these items was favorable development in in the commercial multiple peril line due to improved claim frequency in the accident year 
the unfavorable loss development during the year ended december  is primarily the result of increased claim severity related to personal automobile medical settlements in michigan 
the increase in the prior year reserve estimates for other commercial lines during reflects the recognition of approximately million in additional reserves for asbestos claims in the excess and casualty reinsurance association ecra voluntary pool 
during the years ended december   and  estimated lae reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by million  million and million  respectively 
the favorable development in these periods is primarily attributable to claims process improvement initiatives taken by us during the to calendar year period 
since  we have lowered claim settlement costs through increased utilization of in house attorneys and consolidation of claim offices 
as actual experience begins to establish trends inherent within the claim settlement process  the actuarial process recognizes these trends within the reserving methodology affecting future claim settlement assumptions  resulting in the recognition of favorable development 
the favorable impact on prior accident year lae reserves begins to lessen as these claim settlement process improvements are recognized in current actuarial assumptions 
since we believe that the impact of these actions has been previously recognized  we expect less favorable lae prior year reserve development from these process improvements 
this item is reflected in the decline in favorable lae prior year reserve development for the year ended december  versus allmerica financial annual report 
table of contents asbestos and environmental reserves we may be required to defend claims related to policies that include environmental damage and toxic tort liability 
the table below summarizes our business asbestos and environmental reserves net of reinsurance and excluding pools december in millions asbestos environmental total asbestos environmental total asbestos environmental total beginning reserves incurred losses and lae paid losses and lae ending reserves ending loss and lae reserves for all direct business written by our property and casualty companies related to asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability  included in the reserve for losses and lae  were million  million and million  net of reinsurance of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the outstanding reserves for direct business asbestos and environmental damage have remained relatively consistent for the three year period ended december  as a result of our historical direct underwriting mix of commercial lines policies of smaller and middle market risks  past asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability loss experience has remained minimal in relation to our total loss and lae incurred experience 
in addition  and not included in the table above  we have established loss and lae reserves for assumed reinsurance pool business with asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
these reserves  which are included in the other property and casualty segment  relate to pools in which we have terminated our participation  however  we continue to be subject to claims related to years in which we were a participant 
as part of our pool reserves  we participated in the ecra voluntary pool from to in  the pool was dissolved and since that time  the business has been in runoff 
our percentage of the total pool liabilities varied from to during these years 
our participation in this pool has resulted in average paid losses of million annually over the past ten years 
because of the inherent uncertainty regarding the types of claims in these pools  we cannot provide assurance that our reserves will be sufficient 
we estimate our ultimate liability for asbestos and environmental claims based upon currently known facts  reasonable assumptions where the facts are not known  current law and methodologies currently available 
although these outstanding claims are not significant  their existence gives rise to uncertainty and are discussed because of the possibility that they may become significant 
we believe that  notwithstanding the evolution of case law expanding liability in asbestos and environmental claims  recorded reserves related to these claims are adequate 
in addition  we are not aware of any litigation or pending claims that are expected to result in additional material liabilities in excess of recorded reserves 
the environmental liability could be revised in the near term if the estimates used in determining the liability are revised 
reinsurance our property and casualty group maintains a reinsurance program designed to protect against large or unusual losses and allocated lae activity 
this includes excess of loss reinsurance  proportional and catastrophe reinsurance 
we determine the appropriate amount of reinsurance based on our evaluation of the risks accepted and analyses prepared by consultants and or reinsurers  and on market conditions including the availability and pricing of reinsurance 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our primary obligations to policyholders 
failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to us 
we believe that the terms of our reinsurance contracts are consistent with industry practice in that they contain standard terms with respect to lines of business covered  limit and retention  arbitration and occurrence 
based on a review of our reinsurers financial statements and reputations in the reinsurance marketplace  we believe that our reinsurers are financially sound 
allmerica financial annual report 
table of contents catastrophe reinsurance serves to protect the ceding insurer from significant losses arising from a single event or aggregate events such as windstorm  hail  hurricane  tornado  riot or other extraordinary events 
under our catastrophe reinsurance agreements  we ceded million of losses in primarily as a result of four large catastrophes that occurred in in  we entered into a whole account aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement  which provides coverage for accident year for our property and casualty business 
the program covered losses and allocated lae  including those incurred but not yet reported  in excess of a specified whole account loss and allocated lae ratio 
as a result of this agreement  we recognized net expenses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  based on estimates of losses and allocated lae for accident year the effect of this agreement on the results of operations in future periods is not currently determinable  as it will be based both on future losses and allocated lae for accident year we are subject to concentration of risk with respect to reinsurance ceded to various residual market mechanisms 
as a condition to the ability to conduct certain business in various states  we are required to participate in various residual market mechanisms and pooling arrangements which provide various insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that are otherwise unable to purchase such coverage 
these market mechanisms and pooling arrangements include the massachusetts commonwealth automobile reinsurers and the michigan catastrophic claims association 
life companies prior to september   the life companies primary business was variable annuities  variable universal life and traditional life insurance products  as well as certain group retirement products and gics 
in the fourth quarter of and as a result of ratings downgrades  we ceased the sale of proprietary products and gics  and all remaining short term funding agreements were terminated 
in the fourth quarter of  we discontinued the retail sales operations of our broker dealer  veravest  which sold non proprietary products through our former life insurance and annuity agency channel 
as a result  other income associated with the brokerage operations and the related other operating expenses are significantly lower than in the past 
in addition  this was followed by reduced persistency in for the policies that were sold through our former agency distribution channel

this increase of million was primarily the result of million net savings resulting from the cessation of the retail sales operations of our broker dealer  veravest  and ongoing expense management efforts 
also  million of veravest asset impairments were recorded in  which were absent in these were partially offset by an increase in dac amortization of million primarily resulting from the effect of equity market returns being consistent with our assumptions as compared to the effect of equity market returns exceeding our assumptions in segment results also deteriorated million due to lower interest margins on gics  primarily from higher expenses associated with interest rate swaps 
also  net investment income declined million primarily from the replacement of high yield investments with lower yielding  higher quality fixed income securities and lower partnership income

income in included the aforementioned charge of million relating to the impairment of assets resulting from our decision to discontinue the retail operations of veravest 
the loss in reflected the net charges of million relating to the shutdown of proprietary life insurance and annuity product sales see detail in table below 
absent these one time items  segment income decreased million from to this decrease is primarily due to higher dac amortization primarily resulting from the use of higher amortization percentages  as mandated by our then current dac assumptions  to current gross profits generated by existing annuity accounts and to higher redemption rates 
the sale of our universal life insurance business in resulted in a million decrease in related income 
additionally  net investment income declined million primarily due to timing of capital transactions and the sale of high yield bonds 
see also net investment income below 
segment results also decreased million due to lower interest margins on gics  primarily from lower average gic deposits and lower yields 
see also gic derivative instruments below 
these were partially offset by net expense savings resulting from lower distribution and insurance expenses  offset by acquisition costs that we had been allowed to defer in  since they related to proprietary annuity and insurance sales

in light of the restructuring of our life companies business  we concluded that expected future cash flows did not support continued capitalization of the entire cost of these technology assets 
accordingly  we recognized this permanent impairment in other operating expenses 
net investment income compared to net investment income declined million to million for the year ended compared to the same period a year ago 
the decline in net investment income reflects a decrease in average general account assets  principally resulting from annuity redemptions and reductions in outstanding gic balances  and a decrease in pre tax yields on fixed maturity securities 
average pre tax yields on fixed maturities decreased to in compared to in due to lower prevailing fixed maturity investment rates and a shift to higher credit quality fixed maturity investments 
net investment income is expected to decline in due to the maturities of million of guaranteed investment contracts  most of which are scheduled to mature in the first quarter  and the reduction in other general account assets as a result of surrrenders and redemptions 
the reductions in income from gic balances is expected to be offset by a corresponding reduction in interest credited to holders of such gics 
compared to net investment income declined million to million for the year ended compared to the decline in net investment income reflects a reduction in average general account assets  principally resulting from annuity redemptions  the transfer of assets related to the sale of the universal life insurance business  reductions in outstanding gic balances  and a decrease in pre tax yields on fixed maturity securities 
average pre tax yields on fixed maturities decreased to in compared to in due to lower prevailing fixed maturity investment rates and a shift to higher credit quality fixed maturity investments 
deferred acquisition costs compared to dac for variable life products and variable annuities consists of commissions  underwriting costs and other costs that are amortized in proportion to the estimated total gross profits from such products 
we estimate that these costs will be earned over the expected life of the insurance contracts to which such costs relate 
to estimate the profitability of our insurance contracts  we establish and apply assumptions relating to  among other matters  appreciation of account assets  contract persistency and contract costs such as those relating to any gmdb feature and fees payable to distributors 
we regularly evaluate these assumptions to determine whether recent experience or anticipated trends merit adjustments to such assumptions 
for additional information regarding our accounting policy related to dac  see critical accounting policies on pages to of this form k 
allmerica financial annual report 
table of contents in  amortization of policy acquisition expenses decreased million  to million 
this decrease is primarily due to a decline in surrender fees and other proprietary product fees resulting in lower dac amortization of million 
this decrease also includes a million decrease in amortization related to previously capitalized sales inducements that have been reclassified as policy benefits in conformity with the adoption of sop these decreases were partially offset by higher dac amortization of million due to lower equity market returns in relative to as a result of resetting the long term assumption for market related appreciation to percent annually and applying the reversion to the mean accounting methodology  we believe that dac amortization will be less sensitive to short term market movements 
variability in the equity market and gmdb costs  as well as changes in persistency  may affect dac amortization in future periods 
compared to policy acquisition expenses decreased million  to million in as discussed below  during  we recorded adjustments to dac amortization totaling million 
in addition  as a result of a million gmdb reserve adjustment discussed above  dac amortization was reduced by million in absent these adjustments  policy acquisition expenses would have increased million in as compared to the primary reason for this million adjusted increase in dac amortization is that we applied a higher amortization percentage  as mandated by our then current dac assumptions  to current gross profits generated by existing annuity accounts 
higher amortization percentages have been used since the fourth quarter of additionally  we had incremental dac amortization expenses related to redemptions  as described above 
the substantial and sustained decline in the equity market  culminating in the third quarter of  precipitated a number of significant events which caused us to incur large increases in dac amortization 
these included  in large part  substantial ratings downgrades  which contributed to our decision to cease new sales of proprietary variable annuity and life products 
we believed that this business decision would adversely affect the profitability of our existing policies and contracts by significantly decreasing the persistency of customer accounts 
decreased persistency also increased the cost of the gmdb feature of variable annuity contracts  further reducing profitability 
this resulted from a reduction of revenues in future periods due to a decline in average invested assets  whereby the revenues were not sufficient to offset gmdb claims in the near term 
in addition  the market decline resulted in significant differences in actual account value investment returns from those assumed 
this required us to substantially increase the level of dac amortization and gmdb expense under existing assumptions and to reassess the appropriate long term assumptions on account appreciation and gmdb cost 
as a result  we revised downward our assumptions regarding future account appreciation and increased expectations regarding the long term cost of the gmdb feature 
finally  our evaluation of the compounding effects of the market decline and business model changes on the anticipated profitability of our distribution channels caused us to determine that there had been a permanent impairment of the remaining dac asset related to the former partners distribution channel see annuity account values and redemptions for a description of the former distribution channels 
each of these increased costs and changed assumptions are discussed further below 
the aforementioned million of dac adjustments in consisted of six separate items 
first  we anticipated that ratings downgrades and our decision to cease new sales of proprietary life insurance and annuity products unfavorably affected the persistency of then existing customer accounts 
this resulted in the reduction of our estimate of future gross profits and million of additional dac amortization in second  we reduced our estimate of future gross profits expected from our then existing variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies  resulting in additional amortization of million in  reflecting the significant and sustained declines in equity market values and our application of the reversion to the mean accounting methodology 
third  we reviewed and reset our assumptions regarding future market related appreciation of separate account assets and our application of the reversion to the mean accounting methodology 
in view of the additional market declines in the third quarter of  as well as the reduced time horizon resulting for the revised persistency expectations  we reduced our expected rate of annual appreciation to percent percent per quarter  starting with september  asset levels 
this reduced expected future profits and resulted in million of additional dac amortization in fourth  we increased our assumptions related to the long term cost of gmdb for variable annuity products see guaranteed minimum death benefits below 
the increased cost estimates affected our expectation of future gross profits  resulting in additional dac amortization of million in allmerica financial annual report 
table of contents fifth  we changed our estimates of future fees from certain annuity contracts  which decreased amortization by million in finally  we recognized additional amortization of million in related to our former partners distribution channel 
after reviewing all assumptions affecting future profits assumed in our dac methodology  including the effect of the aforementioned adjustments  we determined that the remaining dac asset related to partners exceeded the present value of total expected gross profits by million 
accordingly  we recognized a permanent impairment to our dac asset of this amount 
a permanent impairment in was not required for the other distribution channels because of their higher expected profitability 
other operating expenses compared to other operating expenses declined million  to million in the decrease reflects lower commissions  distribution and insurance operation expenses related to the decision to discontinue the retail sales operations of veravest 
included in other operating expenses of million is million of interest expense related to trust instruments supported by funding obligations  million of derivatives losses in connection with the gmdb hedging program and million of brokerage and investment management variable expenses 
of the remaining million of other operating expenses  we estimate that approximately vary directly with policy count and we expect to manage these expenses down over time as the policy count decreases 
the balance of these expenses are relatively fixed and primarily associated with technology  finance  human resources and legal activities that do not decline proportionally with policy count 
these expenses also include allocations of corporate overhead 
compared to other operating expenses decreased million  to million in the decrease was primarily due to a million impairment expense in related to technology used in our proprietary variable annuity and variable universal life business 
in  we recognized the aforementioned million charge related to asset impairments resulting from the discontinuing of retail operations of veravest 
excluding the asset impairments in and  other operating expenses would have decreased million 
this decrease reflected lower distribution and insurance operation expenses  partially offset by acquisition costs that we had been allowed to defer in  as they related to proprietary annuity and insurance sales 
we no longer offer these products  so we are no longer deferring these types of costs 
gic derivative instruments compared to we use derivative instruments to hedge our gic portfolio see derivative instruments on page of this form k 
for floating rate gic liabilities that are matched with fixed rate securities  we manage the interest rate risk by hedging with interest rate swap contracts designed to pay fixed and receive floating interest 
in addition  some funding agreements are denominated in foreign currencies 
to mitigate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates  we hedge this risk by entering into foreign exchange swap  futures and options contracts  as well as compound foreign currency interest rate swap contracts to hedge our net foreign currency exposure 
these hedges resulted in a million reduction in net investment income during  as compared to a million reduction in net investment income during these reductions were offset by similar reductions in gic interest credited during these periods 
the increased effect of derivative instruments in was primarily due to new swap contracts entered into to replace futures contracts 
the futures contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities statement no 
 and were therefore deemed ineffective for accounting purposes 
the new foreign currency swaps are effective hedges for accounting purposes  thus  they had no impact on other income during the ineffective futures contracts resulted in a million decrease in other income during while we do not currently expect fluctuations to other income to recur  there can be no assurances that we will not experience losses from ineffective hedges in the future 
compared to derivative instruments utilized to hedge our gic portfolio reduced net investment income during by million  as compared to million reduction in these reductions were offset by similar reductions in gic interest credited during these periods 
the decreased effect of derivative instruments in was due to a decrease in average outstanding gic deposits and the associated hedges 
in addition  these hedges resulted in the aforementioned million decrease in other income during resulting from the futures contracts discussed above  which were deemed ineffective hedges for accounting purposes 
allmerica financial annual report 
table of contents guaranteed minimum death benefits the gmdb feature provides annuity contractholders with a guarantee that the benefit received at death will be no less than a prescribed minimum amount 
this minimum amount is based on either the net deposits paid into the contract  the net deposits accumulated at a specified rate most commonly annually  the highest historical account value on a contract anniversary  or more typically  the greatest of these values 
if the gmdb is higher than the current account value at the time of death  we incur a cost equal to the difference 
as of december   the difference between the gmdb and the current account value the net amount at risk for all existing contracts was approximately billion  compared to approximately billion at december  and billion at december  the decreases were the result of an increase in equity market values during these years  as well as surrenders  which result in forfeitures of the gmdb benefit 
for each one percent increase or decrease in the s p index from december  levels  the net amount at risk is estimated to increase or decrease by approximately million to million 
other factors  such as interest rates and the relative performance of our funds  may also affect the net amount at risk 
on january   we adopted sop  which provides guidance for  among other items  determining liabilities for gmdb costs 
the determination of the gmdb reserve under sop is complex and requires various assumptions including  among other items  mortality  estimates of future market returns and expected contract persistency 
on january   we recorded an million pre tax charge to earnings  reflected in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statements of income 
this reflects adjustments to both our gmdb reserve and our dac asset  as well as additional reserves required for our product features 
the reserve calculation required under sop resulted in a reduction of gmdb expense of million for the year ended december   subsequent to the adoption of sop subsequent changes in the reserve will continue to be included in segment income 
future changes in market levels  persistency of existing accounts  including the effect on the age distribution  specific fund performance  interest rates  mortality and other factors  may result in material changes to gmdb costs and related expenses 
on december   we implemented a hedging program for our in force variable annuity policies with gmdb features 
the program s primary purpose is to provide us with an economic hedge against increased gmdb claims which could arise from declines in the equity market below levels at december  also  the program is expected to reduce the volatility in statutory capital and risk based capital levels from the effects of future equity market movements and allows us to retain most of the benefits of reduced gmdb costs in a rising equity market 
the hedge program does not provide protection from the gmdb cost associated with the net amount at risk of billion in existence on december  over time  the actual amount of the unhedged economic cost will vary depending on equity market levels  redemption rates  and certain gmdb product features  such as roll up net deposits accumulated at a specified rate or ratchet highest historical account value on a contract anniversary 
see also  note  adoption of statement of position  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts on pages to of this form k for further information 
as the block of annuity contractholders ages  or if the average age of annuitants increases as a result of antiselection  our mortality costs  as a percentage of the net amount at risk  will increase due to premium increases related to the gmdb mortality reinsurance program 
the mortality reinsurance program  which extends until  provides protection against adverse mortality experience but not against the increasing age of annuitants 
the hedge program also does not protect against the reduction in proprietary product fees and cash flow  which would result from the reduction in net account balances following a decline in the equity market 
we also expect that the hedge program will partially offset the volatility associated with the gmdb reserve caused by equity market changes 
if the equity market declines  we believe that gains on the hedge derivatives will partially offset any increases in the gmdb reserve required under sop alternately  if the equity market rises  we expect a decrease in the gmdb reserve to be partially offset by losses from the hedge derivatives 
there can be no assurance that the hedge program will be effective in offsetting the costs of gmdb and related expenses 
allmerica financial annual report 
table of contents the program utilizes a dynamic hedging approach involving exchange traded futures contracts 
under the program  hedge contracts are expected to generate cash to fund increases in the gmdb claims resulting from declines in the equity market 
as part of the program  investment returns of a majority of the funds underlying our variable annuity products were correlated with widely followed indices which have exchange traded futures contracts 
there can be no assurance that the returns of the underlying funds will be perfectly correlated to the returns of the indices 
also  certain market risks such as those relating to interest rates have not been hedged  such interest rate risk is predominantly in separate accounts that have underlying bond funds  which represent approximately of separate account assets as of december  as interest rates rise  account values decrease  and the net amount at risk and associated reinsurance premium increase 
consequently  the program is expected to generate increased expenses in a rising interest rate environment 
in connection with the gmdb hedging program  we incurred million in pre tax losses on the derivatives contracts for the year ended december  the pre tax loss in was partially offset by a reduction in gmdb expense of million and reduced dac amortization of million 
in  losses of million related to the gmdb hedging program were included in losses on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of income and were not included in segment income  while in  the results of the gmdb hedge contracts were included in segment income 
the following table provides a reconciliation of our beginning and ending reserve for gmdb utilizing generally accepted accounting principles 
these reserves differ from the statutory gmdb reserves disclosed in the section statutory capital of insurance subsidiaries  which are calculated using prescribed statutory accounting principles 
december in millions reserve for gmdb  beginning of year adoption of sop provision for gmdb gmdb expense incurred volatility claims  net of reinsurance claims from policyholders claims ceded to reinsurers gmdb reinsurance premiums paid reserve for gmdb  end of year does not reflect adoption of sop  which was implemented effective january  volatility reflects the difference between actual and expected investment performance  persistency  age distribution  mortality and other factors that are assumptions within the gmdb reserving model 
we maintain a gmdb mortality reinsurance program covering the incidence of mortality on variable annuity policies 
we pay the reinsurers monthly premiums based on variable annuity net amount at risk in exchange for reimbursement of the net amount at risk portion of qualified cash claims 
these premiums are significantly lower on products sold through our former agency channel due to the lower average age of the business 
we retain the market risk associated with the net amount at risk on the variable annuity business 
claims ceded to reinsurers exclude those contracts with a date of death prior to december  and certain other claims 
annuity account values and redemptions prior to discontinuing sales of our proprietary products in the fourth quarter of  we distributed our annuity products primarily through three distribution channels agency  which consisted of our former career agency force  select  which consisted of a network of third party broker dealers  and partners  which included distributors of the mutual funds advised by scudder investments  pioneer investment management  inc and delaware management company 
the following table summarizes annuity account values and redemption activity for the life companies segment according to these three distribution channels

redemptions reflect activity for the period indicated 
allmerica financial annual report 
table of contents the following table reflects the average age of our in force business as of the periods indicated december average age agency select partners total redemption levels for the year ended december  were lower than those for the years ended december  and the higher levels of redemptions in and are attributable to the lower financial strength ratings of our life companies at those times and the effects of the cessation of sales of proprietary products in the fourth quarter of however  our mix of product surrenders was unfavorable in because a higher proportion of the total surrenders came from our former agency distribution channel 
this channel has a lower average age of annuitant than the other channels 
therefore  should the higher relative surrender rates in this channel continue  our mortality costs  as a percentage of overall net amount at risk  will increase 
notwithstanding the recent redemption patterns  we believe that our current overall dac assumptions include reasonable redemption levels 
however  we cannot provide assurance that ultimately redemptions will not differ from our assumptions 
such differences could materially  adversely affect dac amortization in future periods  as well as gmdb costs and reserves  and segment income excluding certain non cash items 
life companies segment income excluding certain non cash items in addition to our review of segment income  beginning in  we also began utilizing an alternative non gaap method of viewing our life companies business 
we adjust the segment income for the life companies for various non cash items 
we believe this measure allows for the review of the performance of this business based on the current cash operations 
in addition  this measure provides us with information regarding cash flows of this business that we can use in assessing the funding requirements to support these operations and any excess cash the business may be generating 
however  this measure does not reflect statutory earnings or increases in statutory surplus or amounts available to dividend from the life insurance companies 
in addition  all dividends from our life insurance companies are subject to regulatory approval 
we adjust segment income for dac because the cash payments related to the acquisition of the remaining business were made in prior years 
since we are no longer selling the products that generated these deferred costs  we do not expect significant future cash payments associated with dac 
additionally  we adjust segment income for the change in our gmdb reserve because this change represents the difference between the cash gmdb payments and the related expense reflected in segment income 
the items excluded from segment income  including dac amortization  the change in our gmdb reserve  depreciation and amortization of certain assets  and asset impairments may be significant in understanding and assessing our financial performance 
segment income excluding certain non cash items should not be construed as a substitute for segment income or net income determined in accordance with gaap 
although this measure excludes dac amortization and changes in our guaranteed minimum benefit reserves  it is sensitive to movements in the equity market 
the primary drivers of this sensitivity are gains or losses on the gmdb hedging program derivatives  changes in the net amount at risk and the associated reinsurance premiums  and the fee income generated by separate account balances 
this measure is also sensitive to surrender and withdrawal rates which increase fees at the time of surrender if policies are within the surrender charge period  but result in lower ongoing proprietary product fees and changes in surrender patterns  which may impact fees and gmdb costs 
a sustained declining or flat equity market would result in declining fees as a result of the equity market and surrenders  while the aging annuitant base would result in higher gmdb costs 
in certain equity market scenarios  such results could cause this measure to become negative and cause statutory losses  which would reduce statutory capital

table of contents segment income excluding certain non cash items increased million  to in  compared to million in the increase is primarily due to lower expenses as a result of the cessation of the retail sales operations of veravest  ongoing expense management efforts and lower gmdb costs  partially offset by lower fees  including surrender fees

total investment assets decreased million  or  to billion during  primarily as a result of decreases in cash and cash equivalents of million  mortgages of million and other long term investments of million  partially offset by an increase in fixed maturities of million 
cash and cash equivalents decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in collateral held related to our securities lending program  group annuity contract redemptions  as well as the retirement of certain long term funding agreements in our life companies segment 
fixed maturities increased primarily due to improved underwriting results in the property and casualty group 
this increase was partially offset by the maturity of certain long term funding agreements in the life companies segment and unfavorable market value depreciation 
mortgage loans decreased principally due to loan payoffs  while other long term investments decreased primarily due to capital distributions from limited partnerships and the sale of real estate  all occurring in the life companies segment 
our fixed maturity portfolio is comprised primarily of investment grade corporate securities  tax exempt issues of state and local governments  us government and agency securities and other issues

table of contents although we expect to invest new funds primarily in cash  cash equivalents and investment grade fixed maturities  we may invest a portion of new funds in below investment grade fixed maturities or equity securities 
the average yield on fixed maturities was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  this decline reflects lower prevailing fixed maturity investment rates and an increased emphasis on higher credit quality fixed maturities 
we expect that the lower prevailing fixed maturity investment rates reflected in the current interest rate environment will continue to negatively affect our investment yield 
at december   million of our fixed maturities were invested in traditional private placement securities  as compared to million at december  fair values of traditional private placement securities are determined by either a third party broker or by internally developed pricing models  including the use of discounted cash flow analyses 
we recognized million of realized losses on other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   principally resulting from our exposure to below investment grade securities 
other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities in included million related to the airline transportation sector  million related to securitized investments  and million related to the communication sector 
other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities in included million related to the airline transportation sector  million related to the industrial sector  million related to securitized investments  and million related to the finance sector 
in addition  we recognized million of realized losses on other than temporary impairments of equity securities in  as compared to million on other than temporary impairments of equity securities and other long term investments in in our determination of other than temporary impairments  we consider several factors and circumstances  including the issuer s overall financial condition  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  the issuer s financial performance  including earnings trends  dividend payments  and asset quality  a weakening of the general market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates  a prolonged period in which the fair value of an issuer s securities remains below our cost  and with respect to fixed maturity investments  any factors that might raise doubt about the issuer s ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms 
we apply these factors to all securities 
other than temporary impairments are recorded as a realized loss  which serves to reduce net income and earnings per share 
temporary losses are recorded as unrealized losses  which do not affect net income and earnings per share but reduce other comprehensive income 
we cannot provide assurance that the other than temporary impairments will  in fact  be adequate to cover future losses or that we will not have substantial additional impairments in the future

we view the gross unrealized losses of fixed maturities and equity securities as being temporary as it is our assessment that these securities will recover in the near term 
furthermore  as of december   we had the intent and ability to retain such investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for this anticipated recovery in fair value 
the risks inherent in our assessment methodology include the risk that  subsequent to the balance sheet date  market factors may differ from our expectations  we may decide to subsequently sell a security for unforeseen business needs  or changes in the credit assessment or equity characteristics from our original assessment may lead us to determine that a sale at the current value would maximize recovery on such investments 
to the extent that there are such adverse changes  the unrealized loss would then be realized and we would record a charge to earnings 
although unrealized losses are not reflected in the results of financial operations until they are realized or deemed other than temporary  the allmerica financial annual report

derivative instruments we enter into foreign currency swap  futures and options contracts  as well as compound foreign currency interest rate swap contracts  to hedge foreign currency and interest rate exposure on specific funding agreement liabilities 
we also entered into various types of interest rate swap contracts to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations on floating rate funding agreement liabilities that were matched with fixed rate securities 
on december   we implemented an economic hedging program involving exchange traded futures contracts to hedge against increased gmdb claims that could arise from declines in the equity market below levels at december  see life companies guaranteed minimum death benefits 
the program is expected to reduce the volatility in statutory capital and risk based capital levels from the effects of future equity market movements and allows us to retain most of the benefits of reduced gmdb costs in a rising equity market 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in losses  reflected in life companies segment income  as a result of this program 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in losses as losses gains on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of income  as a result of this program 
the gmdb hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting under statement no 
we recognized million of net realized losses on derivatives for the year ended december   million of losses for the year ended december  and million of losses for the year ended december  the realized losses during both and were primarily due to the termination of derivative instruments used to hedge funding agreements in response to the retirement of long term funding agreements at discounts 
the realized losses during were primarily due to the termination of derivative instruments used to hedge funding agreements  during a declining interest rate environment  in response to short term funding agreement withdrawals and the retirement of certain long term funding agreements at discounts

we have developed an asset liability management approach tailored to specific insurance or investment product objectives 
the principal objective of our approach is to provide maximum levels of net investment income  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and facilitating our funding needs 
we manage our investment assets in over portfolio segments consistent with specific products or groups of products having similar liability characteristics 
as part of this approach  we develop investment guidelines for each portfolio consistent with the return objectives  risk tolerance  liquidity  time horizon  tax and regulatory requirements of the related product or business segment 
we have a general policy of diversifying investments both within and across all portfolios 
we monitor the credit quality of our investments and our exposure to individual markets  borrowers  industries  sectors  and in the case of mortgages  property types and geographic locations 
in addition  we currently carry long term debt 
we use derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps  with indices that correlate to balance sheet instruments to modify our indicated net interest sensitivity to levels that we deem appropriate 
specifically  for floating rate gic liabilities that are matched with fixed rate securities  we manage the interest rate risk by hedging with interest rate swap contracts designed to pay fixed and receive floating interest

sale of universal life insurance business historically  our life companies segment offered fixed universal life insurance products through our former agency distribution channel see life companies for a description of our former distribution channels 
we sold substantially all of this business through a coinsurance agreement which was effective december  under the agreement  we ceded approximately million of universal life insurance reserves in exchange for the transfer of approximately million of investment assets with an amortized cost of approximately million 
at december   we recorded a loss from this transaction of million  net of taxes 
this loss consisted primarily of the aforementioned ceded reserves  asset transfers  a permanent impairment of the universal life deferred acquisition cost asset of million and administrative expenses of approximately million 
on a statutory accounting basis  this transaction produced an increase in statutory surplus of approximately million

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements 
these statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following critical accounting policies  among others  are those which we believe affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements

table of contents property and casualty insurance loss reserves we determine the amount of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves the loss reserves  as discussed in segment results property and casualty  overview of loss reserve estimation process based on an estimation process that is very complex and uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process is judgmental  and requires us to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims on type of business and nature of claim bases 
using data obtained from this monitoring and assumptions about emerging trends  we develop information about the size of ultimate claims based on historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process  which vary by line of business  include determining the trend in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there are no precise methods  however  for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual development of reserves is affected by many factors  as noted above 
because the amounts of the loss reserves are sensitive to our assumptions  we do not completely rely on only one estimate to determine our loss reserves 
we develop several estimates using generally accepted actuarial projection methodologies that result in various reasonably possible loss reserve outcomes and we adopt an estimate that considers all of the actuarial projection methodologies plus other factors not captured by these methodologies 
we exercise judgment based upon our knowledge of the business  review of the outcome of actuarial studies  historical experience and other factors to record an estimate which reflects our expected ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses 
when trends emerge that we believe affect the future settlement of claims  we adjust our reserves accordingly see segment results property and casualty  management s review of judgments and key assumptions for further explanation of factors affecting our reserve estimates  our review process and our process for determining changes to our reserve estimates 
reserve adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as adjustments to losses and loss adjustment expenses 
often  these adjustments are recognized in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are disclosed and discussed separately as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results 
property and casualty reinsurance recoverables we share a significant amount of insurance risk of the primary underlying contracts with various insurance entities through the use of reinsurance contracts 
as a result  when we experience loss events that are subject to the reinsurance contract  reinsurance recoveries are recorded 
the amount of the reinsurance recoverable can vary based on the size of the individual loss or the aggregate amount of all losses in a particular line  book of business or an aggregate amount associated with a particular accident year 
the valuation of losses recoverable depends on whether the underlying loss is a reported loss  or an incurred but not reported loss 
for reported losses  we value reinsurance recoverables at the time the underlying loss is recognized  in accordance with contract terms 
for incurred but not reported losses  we estimate the amount of reinsurance recoverable based on the terms of the reinsurance contracts and historical reinsurance recovery information and apply that information to the gross loss reserve estimates 
the most significant assumption we use is the average size of the individual losses for those claims that have occurred but have not yet been recorded by us 
the reinsurance recoverable is based on what we believe are reasonable estimates and is disclosed separately on the financial statements 
however  the ultimate amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
variable products deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements dac consist of commissions  underwriting costs and other costs  which vary with  and are primarily related to  the production of insurance deposits 
our variable annuity product offerings included contracts that offered enhanced crediting rates or bonus payments  also referred to as sales inducements 
prior to the adoption of sop  sales inducements were included with our deferred policy acquisition costs 
acquisition costs and sales inducements related to our variable products variable universal life and variable annuities are recorded on the balance sheet and amortized through the income statement in proportion to total estimated gross profits over the expected life of the contracts 
our estimated gross profits are based on assumptions including mortality  contract persistency  asset growth rates  expenses associated with policy maintenance and contract costs such as those relating to any gmdb feature and fees payable to distributors 
the principal source of earnings for these policies is from asset based fees  which can vary in relation to changes in the equity market 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate the historical and expected future gross profits 
any adjustment in estimated profit requires that the amortization rate be revised retroactively to the date of policy annuity issuance 
the cumulative difference related to prior periods is recognized as a component of the current periods amortization  along with amortiza allmerica financial annual report 
table of contents tion associated with the actual gross profits of the period 
lower actual gross profits would typically result in less amortization expense 
the converse would also be true 
however  if lower gross profits were to continue into the future  a partial permanent impairment of the existing dac and sales inducement assets may occur 
decreased persistency and equity market value declines are factors which would lower our estimated gross profits 
decreased persistency not only lowers net fees due to lower average invested assets  it also will increase the cost of the gmdb feature of variable annuity contracts  further reducing profitability 
this results in future revenues being insufficient to offset gmdb claims in the near term 
we review the dac asset quarterly to determine if it is recoverable from future income 
if dac is determined to be unrecoverable  such costs are expensed at the time of determination 
the amount of dac considered recoverable would be reduced in the near term if the estimate of ultimate or future gross profits is reduced 
we would revise the amount of dac amortization if any of the estimates discussed above were revised 
in addition  the disposition of a line of business can result in the permanent impairment of the related dac asset 
other than temporary impairments we employ a systematic methodology to evaluate declines in fair values below amortized cost for all investments 
the methodology utilizes a quantitative and qualitative process ensuring that available evidence concerning the declines in fair value below amortized cost is evaluated in a disciplined manner 
in determining whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost is other than temporary  we evaluate the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  the issuer s financial performance  including earnings trends  dividend payments  and asset quality  any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer  general market conditions  the financial condition and prospects of the issuer s market and industry  and  our ability and intent to hold the investment 
we apply judgment in assessing whether the aforementioned factors have caused an other than temporary decline in value 
when an other than temporary decline in value is deemed to have occurred  we reduce the cost basis of the investment to fair value 
this reduction is permanent and is recognized as a realized investment loss see investment portfolio for further discussion regarding other than temporary impairments and securities in an unrealized position 
statutory capital of insurance subsidiaries the naic prescribes an annual calculation regarding risk based capital rbc 
rbc is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile 
the rbc ratio for regulatory purposes is calculated as total adjusted capital divided by required risk based capital 
total adjusted capital for life insurance companies is defined as capital and surplus  plus asset valuation reserve  plus of dividends apportioned for payment 
total adjusted capital for property and casualty companies is capital and surplus 
the company action level is the first level at which regulatory involvement is specified based upon the level of capital 
regulators may take action for reasons other than triggering various rbc action levels 
the various action levels are summarized as follows the company action level  which equals of the authorized control level  requires a company to prepare and submit a rbc plan to the commissioner of the state of domicile 
a rbc plan proposes actions which a company may take in order to bring statutory capital above the company action level 
after review  the commissioner will notify the company if the plan is satisfactory 
the regulatory action level  which equals of the authorized control level  requires the insurer to submit to the commissioner of the state of domicile a rbc plan  or if applicable  a revised rbc plan 
after examination or analysis  the commissioner will issue an order specifying corrective actions to be taken 
the authorized control level authorizes the commissioner of the state of domicile to take whatever regulatory actions considered necessary to protect the best interest of the policyholders and creditors of the insurer 
the mandatory control level  which equals of the authorized control level  authorizes the commissioner of the state of domicile to take actions necessary to place the company under regulatory control ie rehabilitation or liquidation 
life and health companies whose total adjusted capital is between and of the authorized control level are subject to a trend test 
the trend test calculates the greater of the decrease in the margin between the current year and the prior year and the average of the past three years 
it assumes that the decrease could occur again in the coming year 
any company that trends below of the authorized control level ie demonstrates a negative allmerica financial annual report 
table of contents trend would trigger the company action level 
as of december  and december   both afliac and faflic had adjusted capital levels well above of the authorized control level risk based capital and  therefore  were not subject to the trend test 
rbc ratios for regulatory purposes  as described above  are expressed as a percentage of the capital required to be above the authorized control level the regulatory scale  however  in the insurance industry rbc ratios are widely expressed as a percentage of the company action level without regard to the application of the negative trend test 
set forth below are statutory gmdb reserves  total adjusted capital and rbc ratios for our life insurance subsidiaries and for hanover  as applicable  as of december  and december   expressed both on the industry scale total adjusted capital divided by the company action level and regulatory scale total adjusted capital divided by authorized control level statutory gmdb reserves in millions  except ratios gross of reinsurance net of reinsurance total adjusted capital company action level authorized control level rbc ratio industry scale rbc ratio regulatory scale afliac faflic hanover afliac s total adjusted capital includes million related to its subsidiary  faflic  and is reported net of the million dividend declared to the holding company in december hanover s total adjusted capital includes million related to its subsidiary  citizens

afliac statutory gmdb reserve balances exclude those reserves held by its subsidiary  faflic 
the total adjusted statutory capital position of our life companies continued to improve during  increasing from million at december  to million at december  this increase is after the payment of a million dividend to the holding company  which was approved by the massachusetts commissioner of insurance  and effected in december the remaining increase in statutory surplus primarily resulted from the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes  as well as income from operations 
the increase also includes a million benefit related to the favorable settlement of prior years tax liabilities see income taxes 
statutory gmdb reserves  and thus total adjusted capital and rbc ratios  are highly sensitive to equity market conditions 
a sustained declining or flat equity market would result in declining fees as a result of the equity market and surrenders  while the aging annuitant base would result in higher gmdb costs 
in certain equity market scenarios  such results could cause this measure to become negative and cause statutory losses which would reduce statutory capital 
allmerica financial annual report 
table of contents the improvement of our life companies rbc ratios reflect lower required risk based capital primarily as a result of lower deposit fund reserves and group annuity contracts 
additionally  lower required statutory gmdb reserves as a result of improvements in the equity market and surrender activity contributed to the improvement in our rbc ratios 
the naic is contemplating changes to the rbc formula for life companies 
among these changes are proposed revisions to capital standards for certain products with equity related risks 
although it is yet to be determined when and exactly how these changes will be implemented  they are expected to cause rbc levels to be lower for our company and others with products that have equity related risks 
on december   we implemented a hedging program for our in force variable annuity policies with gmdb features 
the program s primary purpose is to provide us with an economic hedge against increased gmdb claims which could arise from declines in the equity market below levels at december  also  the program is expected to reduce the volatility in statutory capital and risk based capital levels from the effects of future equity market movements and allows us to retain most of the benefits of reduced gmdb costs in a rising equity market 
the hedge program does not provide protection from the gmdb cost associated with the net amount at risk of billion in existence on december  over time  the actual amount of the unhedged economic cost will vary depending on equity market levels  redemption rates  and certain gmdb product features  such as roll up net deposits accumulated at a specified rate or ratchet highest historical account value on a contract anniversary 
afliac declared a dividend of million to the holding company in december  which was paid in january in december  afliac declared and paid a million dividend to the holding company 
both dividends were approved by the massachusetts commissioner of insurance 
the statutory surplus of the life companies  particularly afliac  which holds approximately of the annuity deposits with the gmdb feature  was highly sensitive to movements in the equity market 
this was due  in large part  to the required methodology for calculating gmdb actuarial guideline reserves for statutory accounting purposes 
as of december   the level of net gmdb reserves in the life companies is approximately million 
an increase of these reserves would not result directly in cash losses to us  but it would result in a reduction in statutory surplus 
in december  we implemented the aforementioned gmdb hedging program which significantly reduces our sensitivity to movements in the equity market 
the dac amortization adjustments described earlier see life companies on pages to of this form k do not have an impact on statutory surplus  since dac is not a concept recognized under statutory accounting principles 
effective december   our life insurance companies entered into a ten year gmdb mortality reinsurance program with unaffiliated reinsurers covering the incidence of mortality on variable annuity policies 
for the year ended december   the life companies incurred gmdb costs of million  and ceded million of gmdb costs under this reinsurance program 
in addition  for the year ended december   the life companies incurred gmdb costs of million  and ceded million of these gmdb costs 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of business operations 
as a holding company  our primary source of cash is dividends from our insurance subsidiaries 
however  dividend payments to us by our insurance subsidiaries are subject to limitations imposed by state regulators  such as the requirement that cash dividends are paid out of unreserved and unrestricted earned surplus 
also  the payment of extraordinary dividends  as defined  is restricted 
in addition  we entered into an agreement with the massachusetts commissioner of insurance in consideration of the decision not to write new life insurance and annuity business  whereby we will indefinitely maintain the rbc ratio of afliac at a minimum of of the company action level on the industry scale 
during  we received no dividends from our property and casualty businesses 
approximately million is currently available to dividend from our property and casualty companies without prior approval from the insurance commissioners in the states of domicile 
with permission from the massachusetts commissioner of insurance  afliac declared a million dividend to afc in december further dividends from afliac would require consent from the massachusetts commissioner of insurance 
our sources of cash for our insurance subsidiaries are premiums and fees collected  investment income and maturing investments 
primary cash outflows are paid benefits  claims  losses and loss adjustment expenses  policy acquisition expenses  other underwriting expenses and investment purchases 
cash outflows related to benefits  claims  losses and loss adjustment expenses can be variable because of uncertainties surrounding settlement dates for liabilities for unpaid losses and because of the potential for large losses either individually or in the aggregate 
we periodically adjust our investment policy to respond to changes in short term and long term cash requirements 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million in and  respectively  while net cash used by operating activities was million in the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to lower net loss and allmerica financial annual report

in addition  cash flows from operations improved in due to lower net payments from the general account as a result of fewer annuity contract redemptions in the life companies 
cash outflows in included a payment to settle approximately million of the payable related to the sale of our universal life insurance business 
the decrease in cash of million during primarily reflects net payments from the general account as a result of continued increased annuity contract withdrawals in our life companies segment as a result of ratings downgrades and our cessation of new sales 
in addition  approximately million of cash was transferred  related to the aforementioned settlement of payables resulting from the sale of our universal life insurance business

net cash provided by investing activities was million in  million in and billion in the million decrease in cash provided by investing activities in  as compared to  was primarily from net purchases of fixed maturities and other investment assets  resulting from improved underwriting results in the property and casualty group 
additionally  increased funding agreement withdrawals also contributed to the decline in cash provided by investing activities  partially offset by lower general account annuity redemptions in the life companies segment 
cash provided by investing activities in also included million of proceeds from the disposal of our company owned life insurance policy

compared to  net sales of fixed maturities and equity securities were unusually high in due to elevated levels of funding agreement withdrawals and annuity redemptions in the life companies segment 
net cash used in financing activities was million and billion in and  respectively  while net cash provided by financing activities in was million 
the cash used in is primarily related to withdrawals of funding agreements  including trust instruments supported by funding obligations  as well as a net decrease in collateral held related to our securities lending program 
the cash provided by financing activities in primarily reflects a net increase in collateral held related to our securities lending program  partially offset by withdrawals of trust instruments supported by funding obligations

additionally  during  we transferred approximately million of investment assets and million of cash to settle payables related to the sale of our universal life insurance business 
at december   our holding company held million of cash and investments  which excludes the million dividend from afliac declared in and received in january we believe our holding company has the ability to meet its obligations through the remainder of  consisting primarily of interest on the senior debentures and junior subordinated debentures 
therefore  we currently do not expect that it will be necessary to dividend funds from the property and casualty companies in in order to fund holding company obligations 
in  and  we did not pay an annual dividend to our shareholders 
we expect to continue to generate sufficient positive operating cash to meet all short term and long term cash requirements 
our insurance subsidiaries maintain a high degree of liquidity within their respective investment portfolios in fixed maturity investments  common stock and short term investments 
in addition  we had no commercial paper borrowings as of december  and we do not anticipate utilizing commercial paper in debt ratings downgrades resulted in the non renewal of our credit line in and continue to preclude or adversely affect the cost and availability of credit lines  commercial paper  other additional debt and equity financing

contingencies on july   an action captioned american national bank and trust company of chicago  as trustee f b o emerald investments limited partnership  and emerald investments limited partnership v 
allmerica financial life insurance and annuity company  was commenced in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois  eastern division 
in  plaintiffs purchased two variable annuity contracts with initial premiums aggregating million 
plaintiffs  who afliac subsequently identified as engaging in frequent transfers of significant sums between sub accounts that in our opinion constituted market timing  were subject to restrictions upon such trading that afliac imposed in december plaintiffs allege that such restrictions constituted a breach of the terms of the annuity contracts 
in december  the court granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs  holding that at least certain restrictions imposed on their trading activities violated the terms of the annuity contracts 
we filed a motion for reconsideration and clarification of the court s partial summary judgment opinion  which was denied on april on may   plaintiffs filed a brief statement of damages in which  without quantifying their damage claim  they outlined a claim for i amounts totaling  for surrender charges imposed on the partial surrender by plaintiffs of the annuity contracts  ii loss of trading profits they expected over the remaining term of each annuity contract  and iii lost trading profits resulting from afliac s alleged refusal to process five specific transfers in because of trading restrictions imposed on market timers 
with respect to the lost profits  plaintiffs claim that pursuant to their trading strategy of transferring money from money market accounts to international equity accounts and back again to money market accounts  they have been able to consistently obtain relatively risk free returns of between to annually 
plaintiffs claim that they would have been able to continue to maintain such returns on the account values of their annuity contracts over the remaining terms of the annuity contracts which are based in part on the lives of the named annuitants 
the aggregate account value of plaintiffs annuities was approximately million in december we intend to vigorously defend this matter  and regard plaintiffs claims for lost trading profits as being speculative and  in any case  subject to an obligation to mitigate damages 
further  in our view  these purported lost profits would not have been earned because of various actions taken by us  the investment management industry and regulators  to defer or eliminate market timing  including the implementation of fair value pricing

rating agency actions insurance companies are rated by rating agencies to provide both industry participants and insurance consumers information on specific insurance companies 
higher ratings generally indicate the rating agencies opinion regarding financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims

while any of these factors could affect our business as a whole  we have grouped certain factors by the business segment to which we believe they are most likely to apply 
risks relating to our property and casualty insurance business we generate a significant portion of our total revenues and earnings through our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries 
the results of companies in the property and casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties 
our profitability could be affected significantly by i adverse catastrophe experience  severe weather or other unanticipated significant losses  ii adverse loss development or loss adjustment expense for events we have insured in either the current or in prior years  including risks indirectly insured through discontinued pools which are included in the other property and casualty segment  iii an inability to retain profitable policies in force and attract profitable policies in our personal lines segment  iv increases in costs  particularly those occurring after the time our products are priced and including construction  automobile  and medical and rehabilitation costs  v restrictions on insurance underwriting  vi industry wide change resulting from current investigations and inquiries relating to compensation arrangements with insurance brokers and agents  and vii disruptions caused by the introduction of new personal lines products and related technology changes and new personal and commerical lines operating models 
in particular  future operating results as compared to prior years and forward looking information regarding personal lines and commercial lines segment information on written and earned premiums  policies in force  underwriting results and segment income are expected to be adversely affected by competitive and regulatory pressures affecting rates 
results in personal lines may also be adversely affected by pricing decreases and market disruptions which could be caused by the michigan commissioner of insurance s proposed ban on the use of credit scores  and by disruptions caused by judicial and potential legislative intervention related to new rules adopted by the massachusetts commissioner of insurance to reform the distribution of losses from the massachusetts personal automobile residual market

risks relating to our business generally other market fluctuations and general economic  market and political conditions also may negatively affect our business and profitability 
these conditions include i heightened competition  including the intensification of price competition  the entry of new competitors and the introduction of new products by new and existing competitors  or as the result of consolidation within the financial services industry and the entry of additional financial institutions into the insurance industry  ii adverse state and federal legislation or regulation  including decreases in rates  the inability to obtain further rate increases  limitations on premium levels  increases in minimum capital and reserve requirements  benefit mandates  limitations on the ability to manage care and utilization  requirements to write certain classes of business  limitations on the use of credit scoring  such as the recent proposal to ban the use of credit scores with respect to personal lines in michigan  recent and future changes affecting the tax treatment of insurance and annuity products  restrictions on the use of certain compensation arrangements with agents and brokers  as well as continued compliance with state and federal regulations  iii changes in interest rates causing a reduction of investment income or in the market value of interest rate sensitive investments  iv failure to obtain new customers  retain existing customers or reductions in policies in force by existing customers  v higher service  administrative or general expense due to the need for additional advertising  marketing  administrative or management information systems expenditures  vi the inability to attract  or the loss or retirement of key executives or other key employees  particularly in the life companies segment  vii changes in our liquidity due to changes in asset and liability matching  including the effect of defaults of debt securities  viii adverse changes in the ratings obtained from independent rating agencies  such as moody s  standard and poor s and am best  ix failure of a reinsurer of our policies to pay its liabilities under reinsurance or coinsurance contracts or adverse effects on the cost and availability of reinsurance  x changes in the mix of assets comprising our investment portfolios and changes in general market conditions that may cause the market value of our investment portfolio to fluctuate  xi losses resulting from our participation in certain reinsurance pools  xii defaults or impairments of debt securities held by us  xiii higher employee benefit costs due to changes in market values of plan assets  interest rates and employee compensation levels  xiv the effects of our restructuring actions  including any resulting from the cessation of retail sales through veravest or from our review of operational matters related to our business  including a review of our markets  products  organization  financial capabilities  agency management  regulatory environment  ancillary businesses and service processes  and xv interruptions in our ability to conduct business as a result of terrorist actions  catastrophes or other significant events affecting infrastructure  and delays in recovery of our operating capabilities
