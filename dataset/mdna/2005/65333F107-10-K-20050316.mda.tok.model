results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for were  million  an increase of million  or  compared to  million generated in the same period in we expect our revenues to increase as we add more subscribers and continue to introduce new products 
although we anticipate continued growth in our revenues in  we have launched all of our markets and we therefore do not expect to experience revenue and subscriber growth rates of the same magnitude as we have experienced in the past when we were launching new markets on a continuous basis 
for our arpu was compared with in even with continued competitive pricing pressure  we attribute our ability to maintain a high arpu to the following factors our continued focus on high value customers  the growth in minutes of use during to an average of monthly minutes per subscriber compared to an average of monthly minutes for  and a strong response to using nationwide direct connect  which launched during third quarter we expect to continue to achieve arpu levels above the industry average and anticipate our arpu to be in the mid to high s for during  we expect strong growth of our data services  specifically gps services  workforce management  navigation and wireless payment solutions that we believe will continue to enhance our arpu during the year

our primary sources of revenues are service revenues and equipment revenues 
service revenues increased to  million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in our service revenues consist of charges to our customers for airtime usage and monthly network access fees from providing integrated wireless services within our territory  specifically digital cellular voice services  direct connect services  text messaging and nextel online services 
service revenues also include roaming revenues from nextel subscribers using our portion of the nextel digital wireless network 
roaming revenues for accounted for approximately of our service revenues  which was the same percentage for although we continue to see growth in roaming revenues due to an increase in coverage and on air cell sites  we expect roaming revenues as a percentage of our service revenues to remain flat or decline due to the anticipated revenue growth that we expect to achieve from our own customer base 
we adopted eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  on july  and elected to apply the provisions prospectively to our existing customer arrangements  as described below under critical accounting policies 
the following table shows the reconciliation of the reported service revenues  equipment revenues and cost of equipment revenues to the adjusted amounts that exclude the adoption of eitf no

of the million increase from to  million relates to recognizing equipment revenues previously deferred pursuant to sab no 
and recording million as activation fees to equipment revenues based on eitf no 
the remaining million increase in equipment revenues was due to the growth in our subscriber base 
our equipment revenues consist of revenues received for wireless handsets and accessories purchased by our subscribers 
cost of service revenues cost of service revenues consists primarily of network operating costs  which include site rental fees for cell sites and switches  utilities  maintenance and interconnect and other wireline transport charges 
cost of service revenues also includes the amounts we must pay nextel wip when our customers roam onto nextel s portion of the nextel digital wireless network 
these expenses depend mainly on the number of operating cell sites  total minutes of use and the mix of minutes of use between interconnect and direct connect 
the use of direct connect is more efficient than interconnect and  accordingly  less costly for us to provide 
for the year ended december   our cost of service revenues was million as compared to million for the same period in  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in costs was partially the result of bringing on air approximately additional cell sites during furthermore  our number of customers grew compared to  and we experienced an increase in airtime usage by our customers  both of which resulted in higher network operating costs 
compared to  the average monthly minutes of use per subscriber increased by  to average monthly minutes of use per subscriber for from average monthly minutes of use per subscriber for our roaming fees paid to nextel also increased as our growing subscriber base roamed on nextel s compatible network 
we expect cost of service revenues to increase as we place more cell sites in service and the usage of minutes increases as our customer base grows 
however  we expect our cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues and cost

from to our cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues declined from to 
cost of equipment revenues cost of equipment revenues includes the cost of the subscriber wireless handsets and accessories sold by us 
our cost of equipment revenues for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the same period in  or an increase of million 
the increase in costs relates mostly to recognizing million of equipment costs that was previously deferred in accordance with sab no 
and million due to the increased volume of subscribers 
due to the push to talk functionality of our handsets  the cost of our equipment tends to be higher than that of our competitors 
as part of our business plan  we often offer our equipment at a discount or as part of a promotion as an incentive to our customers to commit to contracts for our higher priced service plans and to compete with the lower priced competitor handsets 
the table below shows that the gross subsidy without the effects of sab no 
and eitf no 
between equipment revenues and cost of equipment revenues was a loss of million for  as compared to a loss of million for the same period in we expect to continue to employ these discounts and promotions in an effort to grow our subscriber base 
therefore  for the foreseeable future  we expect that cost of equipment revenues will continue to exceed our equipment revenues

general and administrative costs include costs associated with customer care center operations and service and repair for customer handsets along with corporate personnel including billing  collections  legal  finance  human resources and information technology 
for the year ended december   general and administrative costs were million  an increase of million  or  compared to the same period in due to the following million increase due to hiring additional staff and operating expenses to support our growing customer base and related activities in las vegas  nevada and panama city beach  florida

as we continue to grow our customer base and expand our operations  we expect our sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative costs to continue to increase  but at a slower rate than our customer growth due to efficiencies we anticipate being able to implement

off balance sheet arrangements the sec requires registrants to disclose off balance sheet arrangements 
as defined by the sec  an off balance sheet arrangement includes any contractual obligation  agreement or transaction arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  has a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  has an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity  or has any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with the company 
we have examined our contractual obligation structures that may potentially be impacted by this disclosure requirement and have concluded that no arrangements of the types described above exist with respect to our company 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
for additional information see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize service revenues for access charges and other services charged at fixed amounts ratably over the service period  net of credits and adjustments for service discounts 
these discounts typically relate to promotional service 
table of contents nextel partners form k campaigns in which customers will receive a monthly discount on their service plan for a limited period depending on the features of the rate plan 
additionally  for situations where customers may have a billing dispute  coverage dispute or service issue  we may grant a one time credit or adjustment to the customer s bill 
we recognize excess usage and long distance revenue at contractual rates per minute as minutes are used 
to account for the service revenues  including adjustments and discounts  that are unbilled at month end  we make an estimate of unbilled service revenues from the end of the billed service period to the end of the month 
this estimate  which is subjective  is based on a number of factors  including the increase in net subscribers  number of business days from the billed service period to the end of the month and the average revenue per subscriber  after taking partial billing periods into consideration 
this estimate is accrued monthly and reversed the following month when the actual service period is billed again 
the actual service revenues could be greater or lower than the amounts estimated due to rate plans in effect and the minutes of use differing from the factors used for the estimate 
historically  our differences between the estimated and actual service revenues have not been material 
equipment revenues include the sale of handset and accessory equipment 
we recognize revenues for handset and accessory equipment when title passes to the customer  which is upon shipping the item to the customer 
in november  the eitf issued a final consensus on issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
issue no 
provides guidance on how and when to recognize revenues on arrangements requiring delivery of more than one product or service 
we adopted eitf issue no 
on july  and elected to apply the provisions prospectively to our existing customer arrangements  as described below 
prior to the adoption of eitf no 
 we followed the guidance of sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and accounted for the sale of our handset equipment and the subsequent service to the customer as a single unit of accounting as our wireless service is essential to the functionality of our handsets 
accordingly  we recognized revenues from the handset equipment sales and an equal amount of the cost of handset equipment revenues over the expected customer relationship period when title to the handset passed to the customer 
under eitf issue no 
 we are no longer required to consider whether a customer is able to realize utility from the handset in the absence of the undelivered service 
given that we meet the criteria stipulated in eitf issue no 
 we account for the sale of a handset as a unit of accounting separate from the subsequent service to the customer 
accordingly  we recognize revenues from handset equipment sales and the related cost of handset equipment revenues when title to the handset equipment passes to the customer for all arrangements entered into beginning in the third quarter of this resulted in the classification of amounts received for the sale of the handset equipment  including any activation fees charged to the customer  as equipment revenues at the time of the sale 
for arrangements entered into prior to july   we continue to amortize the revenues and costs previously deferred as was required by sab no 
in december  the sec staff issued sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements which updated sab no 
to reflect the impact of the issuance of eitf no 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and include late payment fee charges for unpaid balances 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses that will occur in our existing accounts receivable balance 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
we determine the allowance based on the age of the balances and our experience of collecting on certain account types such as corporate  small business  government or other various classifications 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted internally and the potential for recovery is considered remote or delegated to a third party collection agency 
changes to our allowance may be required if we have to alter our write off patterns due to the financial condition of our customers or if we adjust our credit standards for new customers 
historically  we have not had to make material adjustments 

table of contents nextel partners form k capitalization and depreciation of fixed assets our business is inherently capital intensive due to the build out and continual expansion of our digital network 
thus  we record our system digital network and non system fixed assets  including improvements that extend useful lives  at cost  while maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method with estimated useful lives of up to years for cell site shelters  three to ten years for digital mobile network equipment  and three to seven years for furniture and fixtures 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the respective lives of the leases or the useful lives of the improvements 
as we continue to track the utilization of our system and non system fixed assets  we may find that the actual economic lives may be different than our estimated useful lives  thus resulting in different carrying values of our fixed assets or property  plant and equipment 
this could also result in a change of our depreciation expense in future periods 
to date  we have not changed the estimated useful lives that we employ  but we will continue to conduct periodic evaluations to confirm that they are appropriate  taking into consideration such factors as changes in our technology and the industry 
construction in progress includes costs of labor internal and external  materials  transmission and related equipment  engineering  site design  interest and other costs relating to the construction and development of our digital mobile network 
assets under construction are not depreciated until placed into service 
in capitalizing costs related to the construction of our digital network  we include costs that are required to activate the network 
fcc licenses fcc operating licenses are recorded at historical cost 
our fcc licenses and the requirements to maintain the licenses are similar to other licenses granted by the fcc  including pcs and cellular licenses  in that they are subject to renewal after the initial year term 
historically  the renewal process associated with these fcc licenses has been perfunctory 
the accounting for these licenses has historically not been constrained by the renewal and operational requirements 
on january   we implemented sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires the use of a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a non amortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles are not amortized into results of operations  but instead are reviewed for impairment  at least annually  and written down as a charge to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles exceeds fair value 
we have determined that fcc licenses have indefinite lives  therefore  as of january  we no longer amortize the cost of these licenses 
we performed an initial and annual asset impairment analyses on our fcc licenses in accordance with sfas no 
and to date we have determined that there has been no impairment as the fair values of the licenses were greater than their carrying values 
for our impairment analysis  we use the aggregate of all of our fcc licenses  which constitutes the footprint of our portion of the nextel digital wireless network  as the unit of accounting for our fcc licenses based on the guidance in eitf issue no 
 unit of accounting for testing impairment indefinite lived intangible assets  to estimate the fair value of our licenses using a discounted cash flow model 
the estimates that we use in the cash flow model were based on our long range cash flow projections  discounted at our corporate weighted average cost of capital 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our licensing cost may result in different values for our licensing costs and any related impairment charge 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
 we record a non cash income tax provision 
this charge is required because we have significant deferred tax liabilities related to fcc licenses with a lower tax than book basis as a result of accelerated and continued amortization of fcc licenses for tax purposes 
historically  we did not need a valuation allowance for the portion of our net operating loss equal to the amount of license amortization expected to occur during the carry forward period of our net operating loss 
because we ceased amortizing licenses for financial statement purposes on january   we can no longer reasonably estimate the amount  if any  of deferred tax liabilities related to our fcc licenses which will reverse during the net operating loss carry forward period 
accordingly  we increased the valuation allowance with a corresponding deferred tax provision as the deferred tax liabilities related to fcc license amortization increase 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded a deferred income tax provision of million and million  
table of contents nextel partners form k respectively  relating to our fcc licenses 
we have continued to record a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets through december   given cumulative losses in recent years 
we believe sufficient positive evidence  predominately taxable income may emerge in this evidence could support a conclusion that some or all of the valuation allowance may not be necessary by december  impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets consist principally of property  plant and equipment 
it is our policy to assess impairment of long lived assets pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this includes determining if certain triggering events have occurred  including significant decreases in the market value of specified assets  significant changes in the manner in which an asset is used  significant changes in the legal climate or business climate that could affect the value of an asset  or current period or continuing operating or cash flow losses or projections that demonstrate continuing losses associated with certain assets used for the purpose of producing revenue that might be an indicator of impairment 
when we perform the sfas no 
impairment tests  we identify the appropriate asset group to be our network system  which includes the grouping of all of our assets required to operate our portion of the nextel digital wireless network and provide service to our customers 
we based this conclusion of asset grouping on the revenue dependency  operating interdependency and shared costs to operate our network 
thus far  none of the above triggering events has resulted in any impairment charges
