overview the company s principal business is attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits together with funds generated from operations and borrowings  primarily in originations and purchases of multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family focusing on mixed use properties properties that contain both residential dwelling units and commercial units mortgage loans  mortgage loan surrogates such as mortgage backed securities  and us government and federal agency backed securities  corporate fixed income securities and other marketable securities 
to a lesser extent  the company originates certain other loans  including construction loans  small business administration loans and other small business loans 
the company s results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its interest earning assets and the cost of its interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is the result of the company s interest rate margin  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  adjusted for the difference in the average balance of interest earning assets as compared to the average balance of interest bearing liabilities 
the company also generates non interest income from loan fees  service charges on deposit accounts  mortgage servicing fees  and other fees  income earned on bank owned life insurance boli  dividends on federal home bank of new york fhlb ny stock and net gains and losses on sales of securities and loans 
the company s operating expenses consist principally of employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  other general and administrative expenses and income tax expense 
the company s results of operations also can be significantly affected by its periodic provision for loan losses and specific provision for losses on real estate owned 
however  the company has not recorded a provision since management strategy 
management s strategy is to continue the bank s focus as a consumer oriented institution serving its local markets 
in furtherance of this objective  the company intends to continue its emphasis on the origination of multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans  maintain asset quality  manage deposit growth and maintain a low cost of funds  manage interest rate risk  explore new business opportunities  and manage capital 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively implement this strategy 
the company s strategy is subject to change by the board of directors 
multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family lending 
in recent years  the company has emphasized the origination of higher yielding mortgage loan products 
market interest rates on mortgage loans remained low during as a result  many borrowers sought to refinance their mortgages due to the low interest rate environment 
however  during the fourth quarter of the company saw a decrease in refinancing activity 
the company has focused its origination efforts on higher yielding multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans 
the company expects to continue this emphasis on higher yielding mortgage loan products 
the following table shows loan originations and purchases during  and loan balances as of december  loan originations and purchases loan balances december  percent of gross loans dollars in thousands multi family residential   commercial real estate   one to four family mixed use properties   one to four family residential   construction   co operative apartments  other loans   total   the company s increased emphasis on multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans has increased the overall level of credit risk inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
the greater risk associated with multi family  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans could require the company to increase its provisions for loan losses and to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained by the company 
to date  the company has not experienced significant losses in its multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loan portfolios  and has determined that  at this time  additional provisions are not required 
maintain asset quality 
by adherence to its strict underwriting standards the bank has been able to minimize net losses from impaired loans with net charge offs of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company has maintained the strength of its loan portfolio  as evidenced by the company s ratio of its allowance for loan losses to non performing loans of and at december  and  respectively 
the company seeks to maintain its loans in performing status through  among other things  strict collection efforts  and consistently monitors non performing assets in an effort to return them to performing status 
to this end  management reviews the quality of loans and reports to the loan committee of the board of directors of the bank on a monthly basis 
from time to time  the company has sold and may continue to make sales of delinquent mortgage loans 
the bank sold eleven delinquent mortgage loans totaling million and sixteen delinquent mortgage loans totaling million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the terms of these loan sales included cash due upon closing of the sale  no contingencies or recourse to the bank  servicing is released to the buyer and time is of the essence 
the bank did not incur any gains or losses in connection with these sales 
there can be no assurances that the bank will continue this strategy in future periods  or if continued  we will be able to find buyers to pay adequate consideration 
non performing assets amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were at december   the same as that at december  managing deposit growth and maintaining low cost of funds 
the company has a relatively stable retail deposit base drawn from its market area through its ten full service offices 
although the company seeks to retain existing deposits and maintain depositor relationships by offering quality service and competitive interest rates to its customers  the company also seeks to keep deposit growth within reasonable limits and its strategic plan 
management intends to balance its goal to maintain competitive interest rates on deposits while seeking to manage its overall cost of funds to finance its strategies 
the company generally relies on its deposit base as its principal source of funding 
however  the bank is also a member of the fhlb ny  which provides it with an additional source of borrowing 
these borrowings help the company fund asset growth and increase net interest income 
during  the company realized an increase in due to depositors of million and an increase in borrowed funds of million 
managing interest rate risk 
the company seeks to manage its interest rate risk by actively reviewing the repricing and maturities of its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the mix of loans originated by the company fixed or arm is determined in large part by borrowers preferences and prevailing market conditions 
the company seeks to manage the interest rate risk of the loan portfolio by actively managing its security portfolio and borrowings 
by adjusting the mix of fixed and adjustable rate securities  as well as the maturities of the securities  the company has the ability to manage the combined interest rate sensitivity of its assets 
see interest rate sensitivity analysis 
additionally  the company seeks to balance the interest rate sensitivity of its assets by managing the maturities of its liabilities 
during  in response to the low interest rate environment  the bank extended the maturity of borrowings as they matured  and focused on attracting longer term certificates of deposit 
management believes that the interest rate exposure of the company has been reduced by implementing these strategies 
exploring new business opportunities 
the company has in the past increased growth through acquisitions of financial institutions and branches of other financial institutions  and will continue to pursue growth through acquisitions that are  or are expected to be within a reasonable time frame  accretive to earnings 
the company has also opened new branches  the most recent of which was opened in astoria  queens in october the company does not currently have plans to acquire another financial institution  but does continue to evaluate the feasibility of opening additional branches 
managing capital 
the bank faces several minimum capital requirements imposed by the ots 
these requirements limit the dividends the bank is allowed to pay to the holding company  and can limit the annual growth of the bank 
as part of the company s strategy to find ways to best utilize its available capital  during  flushing financial corporation continued its stock repurchase programs by repurchasing  shares of its common stock 
during the third quarter of  the company completed its eleventh stock repurchase program and announced the approval of a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of an additional  shares 
at december   the company had  shares held in treasury and  shares outstanding 
at december    shares remain to be repurchased under the current stock repurchase program 
common stock split 
on november   the board of directors of the company declared a three for two stock split of the company s common stock in the form of a stock dividend  which was paid on december  each stockholder received one additional share for every two shares of the company s common stock held at the record date  december  cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares 
the company issued  shares of its common stock  of which  shares had been held as treasury stock 
share and per share amounts in this annual report have been restated to reflect this three for two stock split paid on december  trends and contingencies 
the company s operating results are significantly affected by national and local economic and competitive conditions  including changes in market interest rates  the strength of the local economy  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
as interest rates remained low during  we remained strategically focused on the origination of multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans 
as a result of this strategy  we were able to achieve a higher yield on our mortgage portfolio than we would have otherwise experienced 
prevailing interest rates affect the extent to which borrowers repay and refinance loans 
in a declining interest rate environment  such as that experienced in recent years  the number of loan prepayments and loan refinancings tends to increase  as do prepayments of mortgage backed securities 
call provisions associated with the company s investment in us government agency and corporate securities may also adversely affect yield in a declining interest rate environment 
such prepayments and calls may adversely affect the yield of the company s loan portfolio and mortgage backed and other securities as the company reinvests the prepaid funds in a lower interest rate environment 
however  the company typically receives additional loan fees when existing loans are refinanced  which partially offsets the reduced yield on the company s loan portfolio resulting from prepayments 
in periods of low interest rates  the company s level of core deposits also may decline if depositors seek higher yielding instruments or other investments not offered by the company  which in turn may increase the company s cost of funds and decrease its net interest margin to the extent alternative funding sources are utilized 
by contrast  an increasing interest rate environment would tend to extend the average lives of lower yielding fixed rate mortgages and mortgage backed securities  which could adversely affect net interest income 
in addition  depositors tend to open longer term  higher costing certificate of deposit accounts which could adversely affect the bank s net interest income if rates were to subsequently decline 
additionally  adjustable rate residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities generally contain interim and lifetime caps that limit the amount the interest rate can increase at re pricing dates 
during  the company experienced many of the trends associated with a declining interest rate environment discussed above 
many of the bank s mortgagors chose to refinance their loans 
we saw a significant number of our mortgagors refinancing with other institutions 
however  contrary to the trends discussed above  we saw an increase in due to depositors of million during management believes that the increase in due to depositors is attributed in part to the bank s marketing efforts  which focused on rates offered on select deposit products 
combining the increase in deposits with higher than anticipated loan prepayments  we experienced an increase in our cash flow 
strong demand for our loan products in allowed us to invest these funds in higher yielding mortgage loans 
at december   we had loans in process of million 
for the year ended december   certificates of deposit increased million  while lower costing deposits increased million 
due to this growth in deposits  borrowed funds only increased million during the cost of funds declined to in the fourth quarter of from in the fourth quarter of as a result of the low interest rate environment during the past four years  the yield on our total interest earning assets declined basis points during from this was partially offset by a basis point decline in the cost of our total interest bearing liabilities 
this resulted in a decrease of basis points in the net interest spread to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the net interest rate margin declined basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the net interest margin declined to in the fourth quarter of from in the fourth quarter of we are unable to predict the direction of future interest rate changes 
should interest rates increase during  we could see a reversal of some of the trends we experienced in we could see an increase in the cost of our existing deposit accounts and in obtaining new funds 
however  approximately of the company s certificates of deposit accounts and borrowed funds do not reprice or mature during the next year 
as a result  the average cost of our interest bearing liabilities may not immediately reflect the full effect of an increasing interest rate environment 
also  in an increasing interest rate environment  mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities with lower rates do not usually prepay as quickly 
a reduction in the level of our mortgagors refinancing their loans would reduce prepayment penalties we receive  resulting in a reduction in the yield on our mortgage portfolio and net interest income  such as seen in the fourth quarter of in a rising interest rate environment  this could result in our cost of funds increasing more than the yield on our interest earning assets 
during  the nation s economy was generally considered to be expanding 
yet  world events  particularly the war on terror and the u 
s 
dollar s decline against other currencies  continued to have an effect on the economic recovery 
these economic conditions can result in borrowers defaulting on their loans  or withdrawing their funds on deposit at the bank to meet their financial obligations 
while we have not seen a significant increase in delinquent loans  and have seen an increase in deposits  we cannot predict the effect of these economic conditions on the company s financial condition or operating results 
interest rate sensitivity analysis a financial institution s exposure to the risks of changing interest rates may be analyzed  in part  by examining the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
accordingly  a positive gap may enhance net interest income in a rising rate environment and reduce net interest income in a falling rate environment 
conversely  a negative gap may enhance net interest income in a falling rate environment and reduce net interest income in a rising rate environment 
the table below sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  which are anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period was determined in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are based on industry averages  which generally range from to  depending on the contractual rate of interest and the underlying collateral 
passbook and money market accounts were assumed to have a withdrawal or run off rate of  based on historical experience 
while management believes that these assumptions are indicative of actual prepayments and withdrawals experienced by the company  there is no guarantee that these trends will continue in the future 
interest rate sensitivity gap analysis at december  three months and less more than three months to one year more than one year to three years more than three years to five years more than five years to ten years more than ten years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets mortgage loans      other loans     short term securities   securities available for sale mortgage backed securities     other      total interest earning assets    interest bearing liabilities passbook accounts      now accounts   money market accounts      certificate of deposit accounts      mortgagors escrow deposits  borrowed funds      total interest bearing liabilities     interest rate sensitivity gap     cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap      cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative net interest earning assets as a percentage of interest bearing liabilities consists of interest earning deposits and federal funds sold 
does not include non interest bearing demand accounts totaling million at december  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar estimated maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in differing degrees to changes in market interest rates and may bear rates that differ in varying degrees from the rates that would apply upon maturity and reinvestment or upon repricing 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a significant change in the level of interest rates  prepayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  and deposit withdrawal or run off levels  would likely deviate materially from those assumed in calculating the above table 
in the event of an interest rate increase  some borrowers may be unable to meet the increased payments on their adjustable rate debt 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes that the nature of the company s assets and liabilities remains static 
interest rates may have an effect on customer preferences for deposits and loan products 
finally  the maturity and repricing characteristics of many assets and liabilities as set forth in the above table are not governed by contract but rather by management s best judgment based on current market conditions and anticipated business strategies 
interest rate risk the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in fair value of certain investments due to changes in interest rates 
generally  the fair value of financial investments such as loans and securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
as a result  increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the fair value of the company s interest earning assets which could adversely affect the company s results of operations if such assets were sold  or  in the case of securities classified as available for sale  decreases in the company s stockholders equity  if such securities were retained 
the company manages the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a continuous basis to maximize return and adjust its exposure to interest rate risk 
on a quarterly basis  management prepares the earnings and economic exposure to changes in interest rate report for review by the board of directors  as summarized below 
this report quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and net portfolio value should interest rates go up or down shocked basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
the ots currently places its focus on the net portfolio value ratio  focusing on a rate shock up or down of basis points 
the ots uses the change in net portfolio value ratio to measure the interest rate sensitivity of the company 
net portfolio value is defined as the market value of assets net of the market value of liabilities 
the market value of assets and liabilities is determined using a discounted cash flow calculation 
the net portfolio value ratio is the ratio of the net portfolio value to the market value of assets 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and net portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  various estimates regarding prepayment assumptions are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates

diluted earnings per share increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this was due to a million increase in net interest income  partially offset by an increase in non interest expense of million 
as a result of the increased net income before income taxes  there was a million increase in income tax expense 
the increase in non interest expense includes million in expense recorded in the first quarter of  relating to an adjustment of compensation expense for certain of the company s restricted stock awards and supplemental retirement benefits to reflect that certain participants under these plans have reached  or are close to reaching  retirement eligibility  at which time awards fully vest 
although this adjustment relates to prior periods  the amount of the charge attributable to any prior year would not have been material to the company s financial condition or results of operations as reported for that year 
non interest expense also includes million and million  recorded in the second and fourth quarters of  respectively  to reflect amounts due under retirement agreements with the chief financial officer and chief executive officer  respectively 
in addition  non interest expense in includes million of costs incurred to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of return on average assets declined to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  return on average equity decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily the result of a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets during compared to the average balance of loans  securities and interest earning deposits increased million  million and million  respectively 
the yield on interest earning assets declined basis points to during from during interest and fees on loans increased million primarily as a result of the increase in the average balance 
the yield on loans decreased basis points to during from during our focus on the origination of higher yielding multi family residential and commercial real estate mortgage loans  along with the origination of one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans  allowed us to maintain a higher yield on our loan portfolio than we would have otherwise experienced  despite the declining interest rate environment during the past three years  the effect of which further lowered the yield on assets during the bank s existing borrowers have been refinancing their higher costing mortgage loans at the current lower rates  which has resulted in a decrease in the yield of the mortgage portfolio 
this decrease has been partially offset by prepayment penalties that have been collected 
interest income includes million and million in prepayment penalties collected during the years ended december  and  respectively 
a decrease in refinancing activity would result in a decrease in prepayment penalties collected by the bank  and would result in a decrease in the yield on the mortgage portfolio 
the bank experienced a decline in refinancing activity during the fourth quarter of as compared to both the first three quarters of and the fourth quarter of excluding prepayment penalties from interest income  the yield on loans would have been and  and the yield on total interest earning assets would have been and  in each case  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income from securities is due to a million increase in the average balance for the year ended december  to million  combined with a seven basis point increase in the yield to during from during the increase in the average balance of the securities portfolio  while increasing net interest income  reduced the yield on total interest earning assets 
the bank s current strategy is to reduce the lower yielding securities portfolio and shift these funds to the higher yielding mortgage loan portfolio 
the increase in interest income from interest earning deposits and federal funds sold is due to an increase in their average balance and yield during compared to interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   the same as for the year ended december  the increase of million in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities was offset by a basis point decline in the cost of interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of funds is primarily due to the declining interest rate environment experienced during the past three years  the effect of which further lowered the cost of funds during this was coupled with an increase in the average balance of lower costing core deposits 
the average balance for due to depositors increased million to  million for the cost of these deposits decreased basis points to during  as decreases in cost were seen in all categories of deposits due to the declining interest rate environment experienced during the past three years  the effect of which further lowered the cost of funds during the average balance for borrowed funds increased million to million for from million for the cost of borrowed funds decreased basis points to during net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of million  or  from million for the net interest spread declined seven basis points to for from in  as the yield on interest earning assets declined basis points while the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined basis points 
the net interest margin declined seven basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  excluding prepayment penalty income  the net interest margin would have been and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
provision for loan losses 
there was no provision for loan losses for the years ended december  and in assessing the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses  management considers the company s historical loss experience  recent trends in losses  collection policies and collection experience  trends in the volume of non performing loans  changes in the composition and volume of the gross loan portfolio  and local and national economic conditions 
in recent years  the bank has seen a significant improvement in its loss experience 
by adherence to its strict underwriting standards the bank has been able to minimize net losses from impaired loans with net charge offs of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there has also been an improvement in local economic conditions and real estate values in recent years 
as a result of these improvements  and despite the growth in the loan portfolio  primarily in multi family residential  commercial  and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans  no provision for loan losses was deemed necessary for the years ended december and the ratio of non performing loans to gross loans was at december  compared to at december  the allowance for loan losses as percentage of non performing loans was and at december  and  respectively 
the ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans was and at december  and  respectively non interest income 
non interest income for the year ended december  decreased million to million from million for the year ended december  loan fees increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in miscellaneous fees collected at the time mortgage loans paid in full prior to their maturity date 
dividends received on fhlb ny stock decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the fhlb ny had suspended payment of dividends in the fourth quarter of  but resumed payment of dividends in the first quarter of at a reduced level 
the year ended december  also includes an impairment write down of million on an investment in an equity mutual fund  as management has determined that the decline in market value of the fund is other than temporary 
non interest expense 
non interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million  representing an increase of million  or  from the year ended december  salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased million and million  respectively  as a result of the adjustment to amortization of compensation expense for certain of the company s restricted stock awards and supplemental retirement benefits during the first quarter of the second quarter of included the expensing of million for certain restricted stock unit awards at the time of grant as the participants have no risk of forfeiture  and the retirement payment of million to the chief financial officer 
in addition  the fourth quarter of includes the accrual of million payable to the company s president upon his retirement effective june  professional service fees increased million due to costs incurred to comply with the sarbanes oxley act 
the remaining increase from the prior year period is primarily attributable to the bank s continued focus on expanding its current product offerings to enhance its ability to serve its customers  including increases in personnel to provide these services  and  in  a full year of operating expenses for the branch in astoria  queens  which was opened in the fourth quarter of the year ended december  also includes the costs associated with relocating and occupying new executive offices in lake success  ny  which was completed in the third quarter of management continues to monitor expenditures resulting in an efficiency ratio of percent and percent for the year ended december  and  respectively 
income tax provisions 
income tax expense for the year ended december  increased million to million  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributed to the increase of million in income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and general 
diluted earnings per share increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this was due to increases in net interest income and non interest income of million and million  respectively  partially offset by an increase in non interest expense of million 
as a result of the increased net income before income taxes  there was a million increase in income tax expense 
the increase in non interest income was primarily attributed to a million pre tax million on an after tax basis impairment write down of the bank s investment in a worldcom  inc senior note during the second quarter of return on average assets increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  return on average equity increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets during compared to the average balance of mortgage loans  net and mortgage backed securities increased million and million  respectively

critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are integral to understanding the results of operations and statement of financial condition 
these policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
several of these policies require management s judgment to determine the value of the company s assets and liabilities 
the company has established detailed written policies and control procedures to ensure consistent application of these policies 
the accounting policies that require significant management valuation judgments are determining the allowance for loan losses and when an unrealized loss should be considered other than temporary 
allowance for loan losses 
an allowance for loan losses is provided to absorb estimated losses on existing loans that may be uncollectable 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by reviewing all impaired loans on an individual basis 
the remaining portfolio is evaluated based on the company s historical loss experience  recent trends in losses  collection policies and collection experience  trends in the volume of non performing loans  changes in the composition and volume of the gross loan portfolio  and local and national economic conditions 
judgment is required to determine how many years of historical loss experience are to be included when reviewing historical loss experience 
a full credit cycle must be used  or loss estimates may be inaccurate 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available 
notwithstanding the judgment required in assessing the components of the allowance for loan losses  the company believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the policy has been applied on a consistent basis for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
other than temporary impairment losses investments 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  if applicable  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
notwithstanding the judgment required in assessing when an unrealized loss should be considered other than temporary  the company believes that  as of december   it does not hold any investment securities which have an unrealized loss that would be considered other than temporary
