item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations explanatory note the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
certain statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations and involve various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
see the risks and uncertainties identified in certain risks that may affect our future results below and in the documents filed by us from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 
overview we design  develop and market a broad line of reprogrammable non volatile memory products and analog mixed signal products 
our products are used by manufacturers of electronic products in a wide range of consumer  computing  communications  industrial and automotive applications 
we generally target high volume markets for our cost effective  high quality products 
we have been a committed long term supplier of memory products including through periods of tight manufacturing capacity and cyclical market downturns 
the market for our non volatile memory is highly competitive and market participants have relatively weak pricing power 
although our average selling prices of our non volatile memory products have declined over time  prices are sensitive to conditions in our oem customers target markets 
for example  in fiscal  we experienced a downward trend in average selling prices and unit volumes for our non volatile memory products due to weakening market demand 
in general  we expect the average selling price for a given memory product to decline in the future  primarily due to market competition  product availability and manufacturing capacity 
in response to that trend  we continue to work with our foundries and other vendors to increase the manufacturing efficiency of our products 
we are leveraging our extensive experience in high volume  reprogrammable memory products to develop complementary analog mixed signal products that offer our customers a more complete system solution 
in fiscal  we strengthened and expanded the expertise of our research and development team by establishing our own development center in bucharest  romania and by hiring additional engineers in romania and in our sunnyvale  california headquarters 
in fiscal  we purchased a new building in bucharest for our romanian product development team 
we continue to make substantial investments in research and development to advance our non volatile memory products  as well as develop broader solutions with our line of analog mixed signal products 
sales of our analog mixed signal products continue to trend upwards  reaching of net revenues in fiscal as compared to of net revenues in fiscal we expect net revenues from analog mixed signal products to comprise a larger portion of our net revenues in the future 
our business is less capital intensive than traditional semiconductor companies since we outsource to third parties the manufacturing  assembling and most of the testing of our products 
we strive to maintain long term relationships with our suppliers to ensure stability in our supply of products at a competitive cost 
in addition  in an effort to alleviate any potential wafer capacity constraints  we maintain a supply of wafers in a die bank for selected products 
we market and sell our products directly through our sales force and sales representatives to oems and indirectly through distributors and resellers who sell to their end customers 
indirect sales were a majority of our total sales in fiscal and fiscal our total customer base  including oems and end customers of our distributors and resellers  is relatively diverse and during fiscal consisted of more than  customers 
we have approximately distributors and resellers 
in fiscal  no one party accounted for ten percent or more of our net revenues 
our sales are initiated by purchase orders received from our customers and are typically shipped within a few weeks of receiving the order 
since industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice  we do not use backlog to forecast our future net revenues 
cancellations of customer orders  distributor price protection and distributor stock rotation rights  all industry standards  could result in the loss of future net revenues without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 
sales to customers outside the united states comprised the vast majority of our net revenues in recent periods 
this increasing non united states growth in net revenues was consistent with the trend towards outsourcing of the manufacturing process  particularly to companies who manufacture in asia 
substantially all sales of our products are denominated in us dollars  minimizing the effects of currency fluctuations 
our net revenues in fiscal benefited by approximately million from the termination of price adjustment and stock rotation rights of certain small regional resellers who had not historically used those rights resulting in recognition of revenue and gross margin for the inventories held by such resellers 
description of operating accounts net revenues 
net revenues consist of product sales  net of returns and allowances 
gross profit 
gross profit is net revenues less cost of revenues and is affected by a number of factors  including competitive pricing  product mix  foundry pricing  test and assembly services and manufacturing yields 
cost of revenues consists primarily of costs of manufacturing  assembly and testing of our products as well as compensation and associated costs related to manufacturing support  internal freight shipments and quality assurance personnel 
it also can include  on occasion  adjustments to inventory valuations based on demand and average selling prices expected in future periods 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for engineering  technical and support personnel  contract engineering services  depreciation of equipment and cost of wafers and mask sets used to evaluate new products and new versions of current products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales  marketing and administrative personnel  commissions  promotional activities  outbound freight shipments  professional fees and director and officer insurance 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience and apply them on a consistent basis 
we believe that such consistent application results in financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent our financial condition  operating results and cash flows for all periods presented 
however  any factual errors or errors in these estimates and judgments may have a material impact on our financial conditions  operating results and cash flows 
recognition of revenues we generally recognize revenues as products are shipped if all of the following criteria are met we have evidence that a sales arrangement exists  our customer has taken title to the products  we have performed the services  if any  the sales price is fixed or determinable  we believe that collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  and we can reasonably estimate product returns 
we sell our products directly through our sales force and sales representatives to oems and indirectly through distributors and resellers who sell to their end customers 
we recognize revenues upon delivery to oem customers and resellers who have no  or limited  product return rights and no price protection rights 
we deem that delivery occurs when legal title and the risk of loss transfers to the customer 
delivery is generally defined by the customers shipping terms  as stated in the related purchase order 
if the customers purchase orders do not define the shipping terms  the shipping terms will be ex works as defined in our invoice 
we record an estimated allowance for returns from oem customers and resellers  based on a percentage of our revenues 
this estimate is based on historical averages 
we sell to some of our distributors under agreements which provide for product return and price protection rights 
these agreements generally permit the distributor to return up to by value of the total products that the distributor has purchased from us in specified six month periods 
we defer recognition of revenues until such time as the distributor resells the product to their end customer  at which time the sales price becomes fixed 
on a monthly basis  we receive point of sales and ending inventory information from each distributor 
using this information  we determine the amount of revenues to recognize 
for distributors who have product return rights  we also record an inventory reserve to address the cost of products we anticipate that we will not be able to resell after their return by the distributors 
for distributors who have price protection rights  distributors may take the associated credits immediately and in general  we process the credits one or two months after the credit is taken by the distributor 
we record a reserve to cover the estimated liability of those unprocessed credits 
we re evaluate our revenue recognition policies periodically and no less often than annually 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost or net realizable value 
standard cost approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
we routinely evaluate the value and quantities of our inventory in light of the current market conditions and market trends and we record reserves for quantities in excess of demand  cost in excess of market value and product age 
our analysis may take into consideration historical usage  expected demand  anticipated sales price  new product development schedules  the effect new products might have on the sales of existing products  product age  customer design activity  customer concentration and other factors 
our forecasts for our inventory may differ from actual inventory use and the time we have held finished goods in inventory 
the lives of our products are usually long and obsolescence has not been a significant factor historically in the valuation of our inventories 
we reduce the value of our inventory by analyzing on hand quantities and open purchase orders which are in excess of demand equal to the cost of inventory that exceeds expected demand for approximately the next to months 
we make judgments in establishing these reserves and do not establish reserves if we believe we can sell the excess inventory 
if market conditions are less favorable than those we estimate  we may be required to write down inventory 
if we overestimate the future selling prices  we will incur additional losses when the inventory is sold for a lower price or when we establish additional write downs to cover the even lower estimated sales price 
once written down  we establish a new cost basis and accordingly we do not reverse inventory provisions until the associated inventory has been sold or physically scrapped 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the collectibility of our accounts receivable at the end of each reporting period 
we analyze the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt history  payment history  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  which is created by charges to selling  general and administrative expenses 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of april  income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenues  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our balance sheet on a net basis 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we will include an additional tax provision in the statement of income 
we reassess and may adjust the estimated tax rate quarterly 
we apply the current tax rate to our year to date income and our tax provision and related accrual is adjusted accordingly 
our effective income tax rate was for fiscal we make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
as of april   our gross deferred tax assets  consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and nondeductible reserves and accruals  were valued at million and our valuation allowance was zero 
we have concluded that all of our deferred tax assets will be realizable  based on available objective evidence and our history of income before taxes 
results of operations the following table sets forth the results of our operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated years ended april  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative income from operations interest income and other  net income before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income the following table sets forth net revenues in thousands and percentage of net revenues by product group years ended april  eeprom    flash    analog mixed signal   net revenues    comparison of the fiscal years ended april  and net revenues 
our net revenues decreased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in net revenues was primarily due to a decrease in eeprom unit volume  resulting in a decline of net revenues from our eeprom products of million 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in net revenues from our analog mixed signal products of million  or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  which resulted from the introduction of new products and increased sales to our existing oem customer base 
net revenues from our flash memory products remained constant at million for both fiscal and fiscal net revenues in fiscal benefited by approximately million from the termination of price adjustment and stock rotation rights of certain small regional resellers who had not historically used those rights resulting in recognition of revenue and gross margin for the inventories held by such resellers 
sales to customers outside the united states represented approximately of net revenues in both fiscal and fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gross margin  which equals gross profit divided by net revenues  was for fiscal and for fiscal the  improvement in gross profit in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a decline in inventory costs and a reduction in our cost of revenues as a result of a million royalty expense we recognized in fiscal in connection with the settlement of disputed royalty obligations with philips corporation 
we also benefited from higher average selling prices for our flash and analog mixed signal products in fiscal these benefits to our gross profit in fiscal were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of movements in our inventory reserves in fiscal as compared to fiscal the benefit from sales of previously reserved inventory was million for fiscal and million for fiscal  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory were million for fiscal and  for fiscal the net impact of these inventory provisions was a decrease in gross profit of  in fiscal as compared to an increase in gross profit of million in fiscal research and development 
research and development expense increased  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expense was in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in research and development expense in fiscal was primarily attributable to a  increase in purchases of developmental mask sets and wafer fabrication related to product development and to a  increase in personnel related expenses  primarily as a result of an increase in headcount to support our product development efforts 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in professional services and depreciation expenses 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expense was in fiscal and in fiscal these increases were primarily attributable to a million increase in fees paid primarily to consultants and accountants related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and a  increase in sales and marketing personnel related expenses 
interest income and other  net 
we earned interest income and other  net  of  in fiscal as compared to interest income and other  net  of  in fiscal our rate of return on our average balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was approximately in fiscal and approximately in fiscal the change was due to higher average interest rates experienced in fiscal compared to fiscal income tax provision benefit 
the effective income tax rate was a provision of in fiscal  as compared to a benefit of in fiscal the difference between our fiscal and fiscal effective tax rates was primarily attributable to the reversal of our valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax asset in fiscal comparison of the fiscal year ended april  and net revenues 
our net revenues increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in net revenues was primarily due to the increased sales volume and shift in product mix of our eeprom product line  for which net revenues increased million  primarily from the growth in our inter integrated circuit  or i c  product line 
our flash product revenues continued to decline as a percentage of net revenues but increased slightly in absolute dollars in fiscal as a result of increased average selling prices and increased sales volume  especially in the last quarter of fiscal as we began selling to new oem customers in europe 
our analog mixed signal product revenues increased as we introduced more products to market and established product traction with our existing oem customer base 
sales to customers outside the united states represented approximately of net revenues in fiscal as compared to of net revenues in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gross margin  the result of gross profit divided by net revenues  was for fiscal and for fiscal the million improvement in gross profit in fiscal was primarily due to higher sales volume  lower average costs and greater benefit from net movements in inventory reserves 
this improvement was offset by lower average selling prices and a million charge relating to a one time payment we made to the philips corporation in settlement of disputed royalty obligations under a license agreement 
in fiscal and fiscal  charges to inventory reserves were  and million  respectively 
the sales of previously reserved inventory reduced cost of revenues by million for fiscal and million for fiscal the net impact of movements in inventory reserves was an improvement in gross profit of million in fiscal and of  in fiscal research and development 
research and development expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expense was in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in research and development expense in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related expenses  including an increase in headcount 
additionally  there was a  increase in the depreciation and amortization of software  equipment and mask sets  which were purchased for development purposes 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expense was in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to a  increase in sales and marketing personnel related expenses  an increase in commissions paid to outside representatives of  and an increase of  for freight expense on higher shipping volume 
net interest income and expense 
we earned net interest income of  in fiscal compared to net interest income of  in fiscal our rate of return on our average balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was approximately in fiscal and approximately in fiscal income tax provision benefit 
the effective income tax rate was a benefit of in fiscal  as compared to a benefit of in fiscal the difference between our fiscal and fiscal effective tax rates was primarily attributable to the reversal of our valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
liquidity and capital resources at april   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
our historical sources of cash and capital expenditures have come from our operating activities 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we completed a secondary offering of  common shares that raised net proceeds of million 
during fiscal  we also repurchased  shares for approximately million 
we invest our excess cash in short term financial instruments to generate interest income 
these instruments are us government debt securities  the majority of which have maturities that are less than one year 
they are highly liquid and can be converted to cash at any time 
net cash from operating activities in fiscal  we had operating cash flows of million  which resulted from net income of million  adjusted for non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million and by additions to inventory reserves of million  a reduction in gross accounts receivable of million  an increase in accounts payable of million primarily due to the timing and amount of inventory purchases and an increase in accrued expenses and accrued expenses of  related primarily to the tax provision 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction of gross inventories of million  a decrease of million for deferred gross profit on distributor sales due to decreased distributor inventories and releases of inventory reserves of million resulting from shipments of previously reserved inventory 
in fiscal  we had operating cash flows of million  which resulted from net income of million  adjusted for non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million  additions to inventory reserves of  a reduction of gross inventories of million  an increase in accounts payable of million primarily due to the timing and amount of inventory purchases  an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of  related primarily to the tax provision and an increase of million for deferred gross profit on distributor sales due to increased distributor inventories

in fiscal  we had operating cash flows of million  which resulted from net income of million  adjusted for non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million  additions to inventory reserves of million  a reduction of gross accounts receivable of million  a reduction of gross inventories of  and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million primarily from tax related adjustments 
these increases were partially offset by releases of inventory reserves of million resulting from shipments of previously reserved inventory  a reduction in accounts payable of million primarily due to the timing and amount of inventory purchases  an increase in deferred tax assets of million and a decrease in the deferred gross profit on distributor sales due to decreased inventories and margins at distributors of  net cash from investing activities in fiscal  cash used by investing activities was million 
during fiscal  our short term investments increased by million as we transferred those funds from cash and cash equivalents 
we also used million primarily for the purchase of our new building for our r d operation in romania and for continuing investments in our new enterprise resource planning and supply chain management systems 
in fiscal  investing activities provided million 
during fiscal  our short term investments declined by million as we transferred those funds to cash and cash equivalents 
we also used million primarily for the acquisition of test equipment 
in fiscal  investing activities used million 
during fiscal  we invested million in short term investments and we used million primarily for the acquisition of design software and equipment for research and development activities and our manufacturing operations 
net cash from financing activities in fiscal  cash used by financing activities was  consisting of million for the repurchase of an aggregate of  shares of common stock on the open market  at an average price per share of partially offset by million in net proceeds from our public offering of  shares of common stock in july and  in proceeds from the sale of common stock through the exercise of stock options by employees 
in fiscal  cash used by financing activities was million 
in a private transaction we purchased  shares from elex nv  our largest stockholder  for per share and an aggregate of million  which represented a discount from the closing market price on the nasdaq national market on the last trading date prior to the approval of the transaction by our board of directors 
separately  we purchased  shares of our common stock from the open market as part of our open market repurchase program 
we also received million of proceeds upon the exercise of stock options by employees 
in fiscal  cash used by financing activities was million 
we used million to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in the open market as part of our open market repurchase program 
we also received  of proceeds upon the exercise of stock options by employees 
common stock repurchase plan in september  our board of directors authorized a program for the open market repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
under the program  as amended  we were authorized to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares  which included the most recent authorization in february for an additional  shares 
as of july   we have purchased the maximum number of shares authorized under the program 
the purpose of this share repurchase program was to reduce the long term potential dilution in earnings per share that might result from issuances under our stock option plans and to take advantage of the relatively low price of our common stock 
the following table summarizes the activity of the open market repurchase program through april  and does not include our repurchases of shares from elex nv years ended april  total shares repurchased in open market    total cost of shares     average cost per share contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of april  and the effects these obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands years ended april  total less than year years years more than years contractual cash obligations operating leases wafer purchases   other purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations   our primary facility lease is our business office in sunnyvale  california 
this lease expires in and allows us to exercise an option to extend the term by an additional five years 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities of financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  or spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purpose 
as of april   we are not involved in any spe transactions 
future liquidity we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
we have no current plans  nor are we currently negotiating  to obtain additional financing 
our long term plan is to finance our core business operations with cash we generate from operations 
however  from time to time we may raise additional capital through a variety of sources  including the public equity market  private financings  collaborative arrangements and debt 
the additional capital we raise could be used for working capital purposes  to fund our research and development activities or our capital expenditures or to acquire complementary businesses or technologies 
if we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or securities convertible into equity  our stockholders may experience dilution 
those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of the common stock 
additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing  or to obtain it on acceptable terms  we may be unable to successfully support our business requirements 
effects of transactions with related parties elex nv during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began taking delivery of wafers fabricated by x fab  a wholly owned subsidiary of elex nv  a belgian holding company  that owned  shares  or of our outstanding shares  as of april  mr 
roland duch telet  the chairman and chief executive officer of elex nv  serves as a member of our board of directors 
the wafers provided by x fab include wafers for our analog mixed signal products and eeprom products 
we believe that the cost of the wafers we purchase from x fab is no greater than comparable materials available from alternative foundries 
we periodically negotiate the prices of wafers purchased from x fab with x fab management and compare those prices to quotes we obtain from other prospective foundries and pricing surveys published by various industry trade organizations 
we purchased million  million and million of wafers from x fab in fiscal  and  respectively 
as of april  and  the total amount we owed to x fab was  and  respectively 
other than purchase orders currently open with x fab  there is no purchasing agreement in place with x fab 
on april   we purchased  shares of our common stock from elex nv for per share and an aggregate of million 
lxi corporation we had an informal arrangement from through january to obtain engineering services from lxi corporation  a california corporation  or lxi  a provider of engineering services through essex com srl  or essex  lxi s wholly owned subsidiary in romania 
the number of full time engineers we used was dependent upon the scope and number of research and development projects in process at a given time 
these services related to our key development projects including development  design  layout and test program development services 
we believe that we received these engineering services from lxi on terms and at rates that were at least as favorable  if not more favorable  than we could obtain from unaffiliated third parties 
two of our officers  gelu voicu and thomas e 
gay iii  owned approximately and  respectively  of lxi until february mr 
gay  who had served as a director of lxi  resigned from that position in january mr 
voicu and mr 
gay received no payments from lxi during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal other than  and  respectively  from the repurchase of their shares at net book value by lxi in february additionally  we believe that our former chief executive officer  radu vanco  continues to own a majority of the outstanding shares of lxi 
in january  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary in romania to perform these engineering design services on our behalf and discontinued our use of the engineering services of lxi 
allan advisors  inc one of our former directors  lionel allan  has also served as a consultant to us through his consulting company  allan advisors  inc under the terms of his consulting agreement  we paid mr 
allan consulting fees of  per month throughout fiscal in april  we terminated the agreement and paid the  balance due as required by the agreement 
mr 
allan no longer provides consulting services to us and we have no continuing obligations to mr 
allan under the terminated agreement 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 inventory costs  or sfas no 
 an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter sfas no 
is the result of a broader effort by the fasb working with the international accounting standards board to reduce differences between united states and international accounting standards 
sfas no 
eliminates the so abnormal criterion in arb no 
and companies will no longer be permitted to capitalize inventory costs on their balance sheets when the production defect rate varies significantly from the expected rate 
it also makes clear that fixed overhead should be allocated based on normal capacity 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our results of operations or consolidated financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of accounting principals board  or apb  opinion no 
 or apb  to stock compensation awards issued to employees 
rather  the new standard requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  usually the vesting period 
the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of original sfas no 
on stock compensation awards rather than applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of apb are in the notes to consolidated financial statements see note 
although the pro forma effects of applying original sfas no 
may be indicative of the effects of adopting sfas no 
r  the provisions of these two statements differ in some important respects 
the actual effects of adopting sfas no 
r will be dependent on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the valuation model chosen by us to value stock based awards  the assumed award forfeiture rate  the accounting policies adopted concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period  and the transition method chosen for adopting sfas no 
r 
adoption of this accounting standard will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
this statement will be effective for our fiscal quarter ending july  on march   the securities and exchange commission  or sec  issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 which provides guidance on the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations 
sab no 
provides guidance that may simplify some of sfas no 
r s implementation challenges and enhance the information that investors receive 
factors affecting future operating results the following lists some  but not all  of the risks and uncertainties which may have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the risks and uncertainties set out below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face 
risks related to our business our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to many factors and are difficult to forecast  which may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline substantially 
our operating results have historically been and in the future may be adversely affected or otherwise fluctuate due to factors such as fluctuations in customer demand for the electronic devices into which our products are incorporated  volatility in supply and demand affecting semiconductor prices generally  such as an increase in the supply of competitive products and a significant decline in average selling prices  establishment of additional inventory reserves if sales of our inventory fall below our expected sales  or the anticipated selling prices of our products fall below the amounts paid to produce and sell certain parts  changes in our product mix including product category  density  package type or voltage  inadequate visibility of future demand for our products  timing of new product introductions and orders for our products  increases in expenses associated with new product introductions and promotions  process changes and or expansion of our sales channels  increases in wafer prices due to increased market demand and other factors  increases in prices charged by our suppliers due to increased costs  decreased competition and other factors  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  gains or losses of significant oem customers or indirect channel sellers  such as distributors or resellers  charges to bad debt expense caused by accounts receivable we deem unlikely to be collected in a reasonable amount of time  if ever  and general economic conditions 
our net revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast 
we base our expense levels  in significant part  on our expectations of future net revenues and our expenses are therefore relatively fixed in the short term 
if our net revenues fall below our forecasts  our operating results are likely to be disproportionately adversely affected because our costs are relatively fixed in the short term 
we may never realize a material portion of our net revenues from our analog mixed signal products  despite our expenditure of a disproportionate amount of our research and development and marketing resources on these products 
analog mixed signal products accounted for of net revenues for fiscal  of net revenues for fiscal and of net revenues for fiscal we believe that the growth in our analog mixed signal product revenues has been limited due to the extended product design cycles and production lead times  and a sales force that has limited experience selling these products 
despite limited product acceptance to date  we continue to invest in and devote research and development and marketing resources to analog mixed signal products with the expectation that our standard analog mixed signal products will be accepted by many of our current customers and that we will eventually qualify and sell custom analog mixed signal products 
competition is intense as we have initially offered a limited range of products while our more established competitors are offering a much broader array of analog mixed signal products 
if we are unable to realize more revenues from these products  our total revenues may not grow 
in addition  if we devote a disproportionate amount of our research and development resources to analog mixed signal products  our development of new non volatile memory products may suffer and operating results may be harmed 
we have been unable and in the future we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of wafers from our current foundry suppliers to fulfill customer demand 
we currently purchase our wafers from two foundries 
to address our wafer supply concerns  we plan to continue expanding our foundry capability at our primary supplier by qualifying our products in multiple fabrication plants owned by the supplier and to expand our foundry capacity with other suppliers 
as the need arises  from time to time  we may pursue additional wafer sources 
however  we cannot be certain that these efforts will provide us with access to adequate capacity in the future at costs which will enable us to remain profitable 
even if such capacity is available from another manufacturer  the qualification process and time required to make the foundry fully operational for us could take many months or longer and be subject to other factors described below and the prices could be materially higher 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our current foundries as a supplier  our inability to obtain additional capacity at our current foundry suppliers  our inability to qualify our current foundry suppliers for additional products  our inability to locate and qualify other wafer manufacturers for desired foundry capacity  or any other problems foundries may have causing a significant interruption in our supply of semiconductor wafers 
we may forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
since we must order products and build inventory substantially in advance of product shipments  we may forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
the ability of our customers to reschedule or cancel orders without significant penalty could adversely affect our liquidity  as we may be unable to adjust our purchases from our wafer suppliers to match any customer changes and cancellations 
as part of our business strategy  we maintain a substantial inventory of sorted wafers in a die bank but limit our investment in finished goods 
we may have adequate wafer inventory to meet customer needs but may be unable to finish the manufacturing process prior to the delivery date specified by the customer 
demand for our products is volatile and customers often place orders with short lead times 
our inventory may not be reduced by the fulfillment of customer orders and in the future we may produce excess quantities of our products 
it is our policy to fully write down all inventories that we do not expect to be sold in a reasonable period of time 
during recent fiscal years  as a result of reductions in estimated demand for our various products  we have taken charges for write down of inventories for certain products  primarily our eeprom products 
for example  we recorded inventory write down charges of million in fiscal  which were partially offset by a benefit of million relating to products that were written off in prior years and sold during fiscal in subsequent years  we recorded additional inventory write down charges of substantially smaller magnitude  which were likewise offset by the benefit relating to products that were written off in prior years 
we may suffer reductions in values of our inventories in the future and we may be unable to liquidate our inventory at acceptable prices 
to the extent we have excess inventories of particular products  our operating results could be adversely affected by charges to cost of revenues that we would be required to recognize due to significant reductions in demand for our products or rapid declines in the market value of inventory  resulting in inventory write downs or other related factors 
we depend on a small number of suppliers for the supply of wafers and we may be unable to meet customer demand due to our inability to obtain wafers 
we do not manufacture or process the semiconductor wafers used for our products 
in  we began a relationship with our principal foundry supplier 
since  that foundry has supplied wafers to us and has been our principal foundry source 
at the end of fiscal  an additional foundry began to provide products to us 
we primarily use our principal foundry supplier for fabricating our memory products and our other foundry supplier for fabricating our analog mixed signal products 
we do not presently have a wafer supply agreement with our foundry suppliers and instead purchase wafers on a purchase order and acceptance basis 
our reliance on these independent foundries involves a number of risks  including inadequate wafer supplies to meet our production needs  increased prices charged by these independent foundries  reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs  and any other circumstances causing a significant interruption in our supply of semiconductor wafers 
we may be unable to fulfill all our customers orders according to the schedule originally requested due to the constraints in our wafer supply and processing time from die bank to finished goods  which could result in reduced revenues or higher expenses 
due to the lead time constraints in our wafer supply  foundry activities and other manufacturing processes  from time to time we have been unable to fulfill all our customers orders on the schedule originally requested 
although we attempt to anticipate pending orders and maintain an adequate supply of wafers and communicate to our customers delivery dates that we believe we can reasonably expect to meet  our customers may not accept the alternative delivery date or may cancel their outstanding orders 
reductions in orders received or cancellation of outstanding orders would result in lower net revenues and reduced operating results  excess inventories and increased inventory reserves 
we may also be required to pay substantially higher per wafer prices to replenish our die bank  which could harm our gross margins 
if we were requested to pay rush charges to our manufacturing or foundry suppliers to meet a customer s requested delivery date  our expenses may increase and harm our operating results 
we rely on distributors and resellers for a substantial portion of our net revenues and if our relationships with one or more of those distributors or resellers were to terminate  our operating results may be harmed 
we market and distribute our products primarily through independent distributors and resellers  which typically offer competing products 
these distribution channels have been characterized by rapid change  including consolidations and financial difficulties 
distributors and resellers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues in the past 
for fiscal and fiscal  none of our direct or indirect customers represented or more of our net revenues 
for fiscal  sales to alr company limited  a reseller in china  represented of our net revenues 
in addition  we have experienced and may continue to experience lower margins on sales to distributors and resellers as a result of volume pricing arrangements 
we also do not typically enter into long term arrangements with our distributors and resellers and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our distributors and resellers 
when we do enter into long term arrangements  the contracts are generally terminable at the convenience of either party and it may be difficult to replace that source of revenues in the short term upon cancellation 
our business depends on these third parties to sell our products 
as a result  our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the loss of one or more of our current distributors and resellers  additional volume pricing arrangements  order cancellations  delay in shipment by one of our distributors or resellers or the failure of our distributors or sellers to successfully sell our products 
we will be required to expense share based payments to our employees  and our financial statements will have a significant material adverse charge 
we will be required to expense stock options and other share based payments to employees and directors  which will require us to record a significant charge to earnings 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r  as amended  is effective for all stock based awards granted in fiscal years beginning after june  in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
our pro forma stock compensation expense was million for fiscal adoption of this accounting standard will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we are currently evaluating our stock based compensation programs to determine what our alternatives may be to reduce this charge in the future 
if we choose not to issue stock options at the levels we have in the past  we believe we may face a more difficult time in attracting and retaining employees 
we face risks from failures in our manufacturing processes and the processes of our foundries and vendors 
the fabrication of semiconductors  particularly eeprom products  is a highly complex and precise process 
our products are currently manufactured by two outside foundries and a number of other vendors participate in assembly  testing  packaging and other processes 
during manufacturing  each wafer is processed to contain numerous eeprom  flash  analog mixed signal devices 
we may reject or be unable to sell a substantial percentage of wafers or the components on a given wafer because of minute impurities  difficulties in the fabrication process  such as failure of special equipment  operator error or power outages  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  nonconforming electrical and or optical performance  breakage in wafers  or other factors 
we refer to the proportion of final components that have been processed  assembled and tested relative to the gross number of components that could be constructed from the raw materials as our manufacturing yield 
we have in the past experienced lower than expected manufacturing yields  which have delayed product shipments and negatively impacted our results of operations 
we may experience difficulty maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
in addition  the maintenance of our outsourced fabrication  manufacturing and assembly model is subject to risks  including the demands of managing and coordinating workflow between geographically separate production facilities  disruption of production in one facility as a result of a slowdown or shutdown in another facility  and higher operating costs from managing geographically separate manufacturing facilities 
we depend on certain vendors for foundry services  materials  test and assembly 
we maintain stringent policies regarding qualification of these vendors 
however  if these vendors processes vary in reliability or quality  they could negatively affect our products and our results of operations 
we have adopted an enterprise resource planning system and plan to soon implement a supply chain management system  which has resulted in and will continue to result in short term increases in our operating expenses and capital expenditures 
in august  we began to implement enterprise resource planning erp and supply chain management scm systems 
the implementation of such systems is a complex and labor intensive process that requires the investment of a substantial amount of time  money and other resources 
we have incurred approximately  in costs related to the purchase and implementation of these systems  of which  was capital expenditures 
the erp system became operational in december and we currently plan to implement the scm system in the second quarter of fiscal while these expenditures have thus far resulted in the successful installation and operation of a basic erp system  we may experience difficulties in implementation of the scm which could result in significant and unexpected increases in our operating expenses  complicate and prolong our internal data gathering and analysis processes  require us to restructure or develop our internal processes to adapt to the new system  result in overtime work of our employees and the temporary use of outside resources to resolve any software configuration issues and or to process transactions manually until issues are resolved  result in the loss of management focus as attention paid to implementation is diverted from other issues  and cause disruption of our operations if the further development of the new systems create new or unexpected difficulties or if these systems do not perform as expected 
while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting  we are exposed to risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate internal control over financial reporting 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements 
this requirement has only recently become effective 
as a result  we expect to continue to incur related expenses and to devote additional resources to section compliance 
in addition  it is difficult for us to predict how long it will take to complete the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting each year and we may not be able to complete the process on a timely basis 
in the event that our chief executive officer  chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section  we cannot predict how regulators will react or how the market prices of our shares will be affected 
we cannot be certain that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective or sufficient in the future 
it may be difficult to design and implement effective internal control over financial reporting for combined operations and differences in existing controls of acquired businesses may result in weaknesses that require remediation when internal control over financial reporting are combined 
the integration of two compliant systems could result in a noncompliant system or an acquired company may not have compliant systems at all 
in either case  the effectiveness of our internal control may be impaired 
our ability to manage our operations and growth will require us to improve our operations  financial and management controls  as well as our internal control over financial reporting 
we may not be able to implement improvements to our internal control over financial reporting in an efficient and timely manner and may discover deficiencies and weaknesses in existing systems and controls  especially when such systems and controls are tested by increased scale of growth 
we rely on third party subcontractors to sort  assemble  test and ship our products to customers  which reduces our control over quality  delivery schedules and capacity 
we outsource all or a portion of our production planning  assembly  test and finish work of our products  as well as our inventory management function to subcontractors who are primarily located in thailand and the philippines 
we do not have long term contractual arrangements with these subcontractors 
our reliance on third parties subjects us to risks such as reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  a potential lack of adequate capacity during periods when demand is high and potential increases in product costs due to factors outside our control such as capacity shortages and pricing changes 
our outsourcing model could lead to delays in product deliveries  lost sales and increased costs which could harm our relationships with oem customers and indirect sales channels and result in lower operating results 
because we utilize the services of a group of assembly and test providers  this makes our operation highly complex  requiring a high degree of diligence in managing the costs of production and overall logistics of our manufacturing operations 
international sales comprise a significant portion of our product sales  which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 
for fiscal  sales outside the united states comprised of our net revenues 
additionally  for fiscal and fiscal  sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net revenues 
the increase in percentage of international revenues in fiscal was primarily attributable to our increased sales in all markets outside the united states while demand in the united states continued to be weak due to the trend towards outsourcing of electronic systems manufacturing  primarily to asia 
we expect that sales outside of the united states will continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenues in the future 
however  our international operations may be adversely affected by the following factors greater fluctuations in demand for our products due to the increased sensitivity to pricing changes in certain markets  particularly asia  longer payment cycles  fluctuations in exchange rates  imposition of government controls  difficulties in staffing international operations  political  socioeconomic and financial instability  such as the military actions in afghanistan and iraq  trade restrictions  the impact of communicable diseases  such as severe acute respiratory syndrome  and changes in regulatory requirements 
our business is also subject to other risks because of our design center in romania and our relationships with foreign subcontractors including  but not limited to  foreign government regulations and political and financial unrest which may cause disruptions or delays in shipments to our customers or access to our inventories 
we do not currently hedge against any foreign currency exchange rate risks 
we may face increased management costs and other risks due to the establishment of our product development group in romania 
in january  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary in romania to provide engineering services for current products and the development of potential new products 
in august  we purchased a building in bucharest for use by our romanian engineering group at a cost of million 
we have no prior experience in establishing or operating engineering services outside of our headquarters in sunnyvale  california 
our expansion of engineering design operations to remotely situated offices presents a number of substantial risks that could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and ability to deliver our products and grow our business  including difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  in particular attracting and retaining personnel qualified to provide high quality engineering services  difficulties in coordinating our engineering operations in romania with those in california  diversion of management attention  political and economic instability  which may have an adverse impact on foreign exchange rates of the romanian leu relative to the us dollar and could impair our ability to conduct our business in romania  difficulties in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies with our romanian subsidiary relative to those of our other locations  including product development management and financial consolidation  difficulties in owning and operating real property in romania  and inadequacy of the local infrastructure to support our needs 
our low density flash memory products may become obsolete 
a substantial portion of our net revenues have been and continue to be derived from sales of low density flash memory products 
flash memory products represented of our net revenues in fiscal  of our net revenues in fiscal and in fiscal in general  the market for flash memory products has been characterized by competing technologies  migration of demand to larger memory sizes and intense overall competition 
other flash memory vendors continue to design  develop and sell flash memory devices with larger memory in reaction to changes in market demand 
this transition to larger flash memory sizes is resulting in a limited and shrinking market for the low density flash memory products that we currently offer 
we have decided not to develop any of the higher density flash memory devices due to the extreme competition in the medium and high density flash memory market and the considerable costs of development associated with it 
due to these and other factors  we are likely to experience declining net revenues from our low density flash memory products  which could harm our operating results 
our ability to operate successfully depends upon the continued service of certain key employees and the continued ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel 
our ability to operate successfully will depend  to a large extent  upon the continued service of certain key employees and the continued ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel 
competition for these personnel  particularly for highly skilled design  process and test engineers  is intense and we may not be able to retain these personnel or attract other highly qualified personnel 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of or failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
risks related to our industry and competition the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical in nature  which may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
we operate in a highly cyclical industry that has been subject to significant economic downturns often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
these types of downturns have occurred numerous times in the past  most recently  in calendar  and during such downturns  we experience reduced product demand and production overcapacity which result in competitive pricing pressures leading to accelerated erosion of average selling prices and reduced gross margins 
these downturns may occur for extended periods 
accordingly  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results 
our continued success depends in large part on the continued growth of various electronics industries that use semiconductors 
we attempt to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible  however  market dynamics make our prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult 
our business could be harmed in the future by additional cyclical downturns in the semiconductor industry or by slower growth by any of the markets served by our end customers products 
competition in our markets may lead to reduced average selling prices of our products  reduced sales of our products or gross margins 
the non volatile memory market is competitive and has been characterized by rapid price erosion  manufacturing capacity constraints and limited product availability 
average selling prices in the non volatile memory market generally  and for our products in particular  have fluctuated significantly over the life of each product and  over the long term  the average selling price of each product has tended to decline 
declines in average selling prices for our products  if not offset by reductions in the cost of producing those products or by sales of new products with higher gross margins  would decrease our overall gross margins  could cause a negative adjustment to the value of our inventories and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies  many of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
our more mature products  such as serial and parallel eeprom devices  compete on the basis of price  product availability and customer service 
principal competitors for our eeprom products currently include atmel  stmicroelectronics and microchip technology 
principal competitors for our low density flash products include silicon storage technology and integrated silicon solution 
principal competitors for our analog mixed signal products include fairchild semiconductor  intersil  linear technology  maxim integrated products  national semiconductor and texas instruments 
if our products fail to keep pace with the rapid changes in the semiconductor industry  we could lose customers and revenues 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing customer demand  over or under utilization of manufacturing capacity and price fluctuations 
to compete successfully  we must introduce new products in a timely manner at competitive prices  quality and performance levels 
in particular  our future success will depend on our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies which enable us to reduce product costs 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by delays in developing new products  achievement of volume production and market acceptance of new products  successful completion of technology transitions of our existing products to new process geometries or foundries with acceptable yields and reliability 
risks related to our intellectual property our business may be harmed if we fail to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
we currently have patents granted and pending in the united states and intend to seek further united states and international patents on our technology 
we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications  that patents will be issued in all countries where our products can be sold or that any issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage 
our competitors may also be able to design around our patents 
the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  increasing the possibility of piracy of our technology and products 
although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights  we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
our competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
our ability to produce our products may suffer if someone claims we infringe on their intellectual property 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
in addition  it is typical for companies in the industry to receive notices from time to time that allege infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights 
for example  in april  xicor  inc filed a complaint alleging that some of our dpp products infringed on one of its patents  which complaint we settled in june we may receive other notices or become a party to other proceedings alleging our infringement of patents or intellectual property rights in the future 
if it is necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under such patents or other intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot be certain that licenses will be offered or that we would find the terms of licenses that are offered acceptable or commercially reasonable 
our failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of products 
furthermore  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
litigation by or against us could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical personnel and management  whether or not the litigation results in a favorable resolution 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  pay amounts to indemnify our customers  stop the manufacture and sale of the infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes  or obtain licenses to the technology 
we may be unsuccessful in developing non infringing products or negotiating licenses with reasonable terms  or at all 
these problems might not be resolved in time to avoid harming our results of operations 
if any third party makes a successful claim against our customers or us and a license is not made available to us on commercially reasonable terms  our business could be harmed 
we may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we have wrongfully used the alleged trade secrets of our employees former employers 
many of our employees were previously employed at other companies  including our competitors or potential competitors 
although we have no current or pending claims against us  we may be subject to claims that we have relied on information that these employees have inadvertently or otherwise disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers 
litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims 
if we fail in defending such claims  in addition to paying monetary damages  we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel 
a loss of key research personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to develop new products  which could severely harm our business 
even if we are successful  litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management 
we may not be able to expand our proprietary technology if we do not acquire rights to use key technologies  consummate potential acquisitions or investments or successfully integrate them with our business 
to expand our proprietary technologies  we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies or products if appropriate opportunities arise 
we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates at reasonable prices or on reasonable terms or consummate transactions with such candidates  the failure of which could slow our growth 
we may also have difficulty in acquiring licenses to use proprietary technologies of third parties to expand our product lines 
we may have difficulty integrating the acquired products  personnel or technologies of any acquisition we might make 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  limit our future growth  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
risks related to our stock our stock is subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  and those fluctuations may prevent our stockholders from reselling our common stock at a profit 
the trading price of our common stock has in the past been and could in the future be subject to significant fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in our results of operations  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our customers or competitors  our failure to achieve the operating results anticipated by analysts or investors  sales or the perception in the market of possible sales of a large number of shares of our common stock by our directors  officers  employees or principal stockholders  international political  socioeconomic and financial instability  including instability associated with military action in afghanistan and iraq or other conflicts  releases or reports by or changes in security analysts recommendations  and developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights or other events 
for example  during fiscal and to date in fiscal  the trading price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market has ranged from a high of to a low of 
if our net revenues and results of operations are below the expectations of investors  significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock could occur 
in addition  the securities markets have  from time to time  experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for high technology companies and often are unrelated and disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
our charter documents  delaware law and our stockholder rights plan contain provisions that may inhibit potential acquisition bids  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  discourage merger offers or prevent changes in our management 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of the shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
if we issue any of these shares of preferred stock in the future  the rights of holders of our common stock may be negatively affected 
if we issue preferred stock  a change of control of our company could be delayed  deferred or prevented 
we have no current plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
section of the delaware general corporation law restricts certain business combinations with any interested stockholder as defined by that statute 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain other provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control 
these provisions include the classification of our board so that only a portion of our directors are elected each year and each director serves a three year term  the elimination of actions by written consent of stockholders  and the establishment of an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals and director nominations to be acted upon at annual meetings of the stockholders 
in  our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan 
under this plan  we issued a dividend of one right for each share of our common stock 
each right initially entitles stockholders to purchase one one thousandth of a share of our preferred stock for 
however  the rights are not immediately exercisable 
if a person or group acquires  or announces a tender or exchange offer that would result in the acquisition of of our common stock  unless the rights are redeemed by us for per right  the rights will become exercisable by all rights holders  except the acquiring person or group  for shares of our common stock or the stock of the third party acquirer having a value of twice the right s then current exercise price 
these provisions are designed to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and give our board of directors an opportunity to consider various alternatives to increase stockholder value 
these provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy contests 
however  the potential issuance of preferred stock  our charter and bylaw provisions  the restrictions in section of the delaware general corporation law and our stockholder rights plan could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control  which may adversely affect the market price of our stock 
these provisions and plans may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management or board of directors 
we may be the subject of securities class action litigation due to future stock price volatility 
in the past  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have often initiated securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is generally comprised of us government debt securities and cash deposits 
our policy is to place these investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards and have maturities of less than two years with an overall average maturity of less than one year 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration of the securities in which we invest and the conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a move in interest rates would have an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the majority of our sales  manufacturing costs  and research and development and marketing expenses are transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  our net profitability is not currently subject to material foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
gains and losses from such fluctuations have not been material to us to date
