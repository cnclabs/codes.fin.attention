item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor disclosure 
underwriting process the company offers ceding companies full service capability  including actuarial  claims  accounting and systems support  either directly or through the broker community 
the company s capacity for both property and casualty risks allows it to underwrite entire contracts or major portions thereof that might otherwise need to be syndicated among several reinsurers 
the company s strategy is to act as lead reinsurer in many of the reinsurance treaties it underwrites 
the lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the largest percentage shares of the treaty and is in a stronger position to negotiate price  terms and conditions than is a reinsurer that takes a smaller position 
management believes this strategy enables it to more effectively influence the terms and conditions of the treaties on which it participates 
when the company does not lead the treaty  it may still suggest changes to any aspect of the treaty 
the company may decline to participate in a treaty based upon its assessment of all relevant factors 
the company s treaty underwriting process emphasizes a team approach among the company s underwriters  actuaries and claim staff 
treaties are reviewed for compliance with the company s general underwriting standards and certain larger treaties are evaluated in part based upon actuarial analyses by the company 
the actuarial models used in such analyses are tailored in each case to the exposures and experience underlying the specific treaty and the loss experience for the risks covered by such treaties 
the company does not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under its treaties 
the company does  however  generally evaluate the underwriting guidelines of its ceding companies to determine their adequacy prior to entering into a treaty 
the company  when appropriate  also conducts underwriting  operational and claim audits at the offices of ceding companies to ensure that the ceding companies operate within such guidelines 
underwriting audits focus on the quality of the underwriting staff  the selection and pricing of risks and the capability of monitoring price levels over time 
claim audits  when appropriate  are performed in order to evaluate the client s claims handling abilities and practices 
the company s facultative underwriters operate within guidelines specifying acceptable types of risks  limits and maximum risk exposures 
specified classes of us risks and large premium risks are referred to everest re s new york facultative headquarters for specific review before premium quotations are given to clients 
in addition  the company s guidelines require certain types of risks to be submitted for review because of their aggregate limits  complexity or volatility  regardless of premium amount on the underlying contract 
non us risks exhibiting similar characteristics are reviewed by senior managers within the involved operations 
the company s insurance operations principally write property and casualty coverages for homogeneous risks through select program managers 
these programs are evaluated based upon actuarial analysis and the program manager s capabilities 
the company s rates  forms and underwriting guidelines are tailored to specific risk types 
the company s underwriting  actuarial  claim and financial functions work closely with its program managers to establish appropriate underwriting and processing guidelines as well as appropriate monitoring mechanisms 
risk management and retrocession arrangements the company manages its risk of loss through a combination of aggregate exposure limits  underwriting guidelines that take into account risks  prices and coverage  and retrocessional arrangements 
the company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence  whether a natural event  such as a hurricane or an earthquake  or other catastrophe  such as an explosion at a major factory 
any such catastrophic event could generate insured losses in one  several or many of the company s treaties or lines of business  including property and or casualty exposures 
the company employs various techniques  including licensed modeling software  to assess its accumulated exposure 
such techniques are inherently more difficult to apply to non property exposures 
accumulated exposures with respect to catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss pml 
the company defines pml as its anticipated maximum loss  taking into account contract limits  caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area  such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake  of such a magnitude that it is expected to occur once in every years 
management believes that the company s greatest catastrophe exposure world wide from any single event is to a us earthquake affecting the west coast including workers compensation exposure where the company estimates it has a pre tax pml exposure of million 
the company further estimates that its second largest exposure relates to a hurricane affecting the us east coast with a pre tax pml of million 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience losses from one or more catastrophic events that exceed  perhaps by a substantial amount  its estimated pml 
the us terrorism risk insurance act of was signed into law in november this legislation provides federal reimbursement of of insured losses  in excess of statutory retention levels  due to acts of terrorism carried out by foreign powers on us soil or against us air carriers  vessels or foreign missions 
this coverage does not apply to reinsurance 
reinsurance contracts generally exclude losses arising from terrorist events  except where such coverage has been specifically included in the underwriting and pricing of the involved reinsurance 
as the terrorism risk insurance act of is due to expire on december   the company is generally excluding coverage for terrorism risks effective january  on its insurance business  where such exclusions have been approved by state regulators 
these endorsements are conditional based on an extension or modification of the legislation 
the company does not believe that this legislation has had a significant impact on its operations 
underwriting guidelines have been established for each business unit 
these guidelines place dollar limits on the amount of business that can be written based on a variety of factors  including ceding company  line of business  geographical location and risk hazards 
in each case  those guidelines permit limited exceptions  which must be authorized by the company s senior management 
the company employs a retrocessional approach under which the company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or exposure accumulations or as a corporate level retrocessional program covering the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of the company s operations 
all reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions with respect to the pricing  terms  conditions and availability of such coverage  with the aim of securing cost effective protection 
the level of reinsurance coverage varies over time  reflecting the underwriter s and or company s view of the changing dynamics of both the underlying exposure and the reinsurance markets 
the company does not typically purchase significant amounts of reinsurance to cover specific reinsurance business written  but it does from time to time purchase retrocessional protections where underwriting management deems it to be prudent and or cost effective to reinsure a portion of the specific risks being assumed 
the company purchased an excess property facultative retrocessional program in and as well as an excess workers compensation retrocessional program in in addition  the company purchased an excess property catastrophe retrocessional program for losses incurred outside of the us in and the program  which expired on june   was not renewed 
the company also participates in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain reinsurance treaties 
common account reinsurance arrangements are arrangements whereby the ceding company purchases reinsurance for the benefit of itself and its reinsurers on one or more of its reinsurance treaties 
common account retrocessional arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all participating companies  including the ceding company  with respect to the involved treaties 
the company typically considers the purchase of reinsurance to cover insurance program exposures written by the us insurance operation 
the type of reinsurance coverage considered is dependent upon individual risk exposures  individual program exposures  aggregate exposures by line of business  overall segment exposures and the cost effectiveness of available reinsurance 
facultative reinsurance will typically be considered for individual accounts with large exposure and quota share reinsurance will generally be considered for individual programs of business 
in evaluating the purchase of reinsurance for a line of business  the company generally seeks to limit exposure to individual claim severity as opposed to frequency 
for workers compensation  the company s predominant business line at the time  the company purchased in  for policies incepting during and after november  a workers compensation reinsurance program that provided for statutory limits coverage in excess of  of losses per occurrence on the company s workers compensation insurance business written prior to november  effective november  this primary workers compensation reinsurance program provided statutory limits coverage in excess of  of losses per occurrence for business written prior to december  the company has not purchased such coverage for the period subsequent to december  the remaining net aggregate u 
s insurance segment exposures  after purchasing facultative reinsurance  quota share program reinsurance and or aggregate line of business coverage  are considered in evaluating the purchase of corporate level retrocessional protection 
the company considers purchasing corporate level retrocessional protection covering the potential accumulation of exposures 
such consideration includes balancing the underlying exposures against the availability of cost effective retrocessional protection 
for years ended december   and  the company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocession coverage that provided up to million of coverage for each year 
these excess of loss policies provided coverage if everest re s consolidated statutory basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a loss ratio attachment point for each year of coverage 
the attachment point was net of inuring reinsurance and included adjustable premium provisions that effectively caused the company to offset  on a pre tax income basis  up to approximately of such ceded losses 
the maximum recovery for each year was million before giving effect to the adjustable premium 
as of december   the company has ceded the maximum limits under all three contracts 
the company did not purchase similar coverage subsequent to december  although certain of the company s catastrophe and aggregate excess of loss retrocessions have terms which provide for additional premiums to be paid to the retrocessionaire in the event that losses are ceded  all aspects of the company s retrocessional program have been structured to permit these agreements to be accounted for as reinsurance under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts 
if a single catastrophe were to occur that resulted in million of gross loss and lae in an amount equivalent to the company s pml  management estimates that the effect on the company s income would be approximately million and million before and after taxes  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience one or more catastrophic events that could cause these estimates to be exceeded  perhaps by a substantial amount 
in connection with the company s acquisition of mt 
mckinley in september  the company had coverage under an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement provided by prudential property and casualty insurance company of indiana prupac  a wholly owned subsidiary of the prudential 
on october   lm property casualty insurance company lm completed its purchase of prupac and its obligations from the prudential 
the prudential continues to guarantee lm s obligation under this agreement 
this agreement covers or million of the first million of any adverse loss reserve development on the carried reserves of mt 
mckinley at the date of acquisition and reimburses the company as such losses are paid by the company 
cessions under this reinsurance agreement exhausted the limit available under the contract at december  as of december   the company carried as an asset  million in reinsurance receivables with respect to losses ceded 
of this amount  million  or  was receivable from subsidiaries of london reinsurance group london life  million  or  was receivable from lm  million  or  was receivable from transatlantic reinsurance company transatlantic and million  or  was receivable from continental insurance company continental 
no other retrocessionaire accounted for more than of the company s receivables 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition 
the company s arrangements with both london life and continental are managed on a funds held basis  which means that the company has not released premium payments to the retrocessionaire  but rather retains such payments to secure obligations of the retrocessionaire  records them as a liability  credits interest on the balances and reduces the liability account as payments become due 
as of december   such funds had reduced the company s net exposure to london life to million  effectively of which has been secured by letters of credit  and its exposure to continental to million 
lm s obligations are guaranteed by the prudential 
no assurance can be given that the company will seek or be able to obtain retrocessional coverage in the future similar to that in place currently or in the past 
the company continuously evaluates its exposures and risk capacities in the context of reinsurance market conditions  at both the specific and corporate level 
although management carefully selects its reinsurers  the company is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurance because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve the company of its liability to insureds or ceding companies 
claims reinsurance claims are managed by the company s professional claims staff whose responsibilities include reviewing initial loss reports and coverage issues  monitoring claims handling activities of ceding companies  establishing and adjusting proper case reserves and approving payment of claims 
in addition to claims assessment  processing and payment  the claims staff selectively conducts comprehensive claim audits of both specific claims and overall claim procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies 
insurance claims  except those relating to mt 
mckinley s business  are generally handled by third party claims services providers who have limited authority and are subject to oversight by the company s professional claims staff 
the company intensively manages its asbestos and environmental a e exposures through dedicated  centrally managed claim staffs for mt 
mckinley and everest re 
both are staffed with experienced claim and legal professionals that specialize in the handling of such exposures 
these units actively manage each individual insured and reinsured account  responding to claim developments with evaluations of the involved exposures and adjustment of reserves as appropriate 
specific or general claim developments that may have material implications for the company are regularly communicated to senior management  actuarial  legal and financial areas 
meetings among these areas  claim management and senior management are held at least quarterly to review the company s overall reserve positions and make changes  if appropriate 
the company continually reviews its internal processing  communications and analytics  seeking to enhance the management of its a e exposures  in particular in the context of changes in the landscape of asbestos claims and litigation 
reserves for unpaid property and casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the reinsurer and the payment of that loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to the insurer by the reinsurer 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and lae  insurers and reinsurers establish reserves  which are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related expenses on losses that have already occurred 
actual losses and lae paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from such reserves 
to the extent reserves prove to be insufficient to cover actual losses and lae after taking into account available reinsurance coverage  the company would have to augment such reserves and incur a charge to earnings  which could be material in the period such augmentation takes place 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations loss and lae reserves 
while the reserving process is difficult and subjective for insurance companies  the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer  due primarily to the longer time between the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any attendant claims to the reinsurer  the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts  the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
in addition  trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or affect liability development to the same degree in the future 
as a result  actual losses and lae may deviate  perhaps substantially  from estimates of reserves reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
like many other property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies  the company has experienced adverse loss development for prior accident years  which has led to adjustments in losses and lae reserves 
the increase in net reserves for prior accident years reduced net income for the periods in which the adjustments were made 
there can be no assurance that adverse development from prior years will not continue in the future or that such adverse development will not have a material adverse effect on net income 
changes in historical reserves the following table shows changes in historical loss reserves for the company for and subsequent years 
the table is presented on a gaap basis except that the company s loss reserves for its canadian branch operations are presented in canadian dollars  the impact of which is not material 
the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and lae recorded at each year end date 
each amount in the top line represents the estimated amount of future payments for losses and lae on claims occurring in that year and in all prior years 
the upper paid portion of the table presents the cumulative amounts paid through each subsequent year on those claims for which reserves were carried as of each specific year end 
the lower liability re estimated portion shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the reserve estimates change as more information becomes known about the actual claims for which the initial reserves were carried 
the cumulative redundancy deficiency line represents the cumulative change in estimates since the initial reserve was established 
it is equal to the initial reserve less the latest liability re estimated amount 
each amount other than the original reserves in the top half of the table below includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods 
for example  if a loss settled in for  was first reserved in at  and remained unchanged until settlement  the  deficiency actual loss minus original estimate would be included in the cumulative redundancy deficiency in each of the years in the period through shown below 
conditions and trends that have affected development of liability in the past are not indicative of future developments 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table

some totals may not reconcile due to rounding 
the most recent six years on the above table reflect cumulative deficiencies  also referred to as adverse development  with the largest indicated deficiency in three active classes of business are the principal contributors to those deficiencies professional liability reinsurance  general casualty reinsurance and workers compensation insurance 
in addition to these active business classes  there continues to be adverse experience on a e reserves 
in the professional liability reinsurance class  the late s and early s saw a proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other corporate  financial and or management improprieties 
this resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of claims on the professional liability policies reinsured by the company 
in the general casualty area  the company continues to experience claim frequency and severity greater than expected in the company s pricing and reserving assumptions  particularly for accident years and these losses reflect unfavorable trends in litigation and economic variability 
with respect to both of these classes  another factor was the increasingly competitive conditions in insurance and reinsurance markets during this period 
while the company seeks to manage the impact of competitive condition changes on its results  it is generally unable to divorce itself entirely from the underlying industry cycles of its principal business 
see item  business competition 
in the workers compensation insurance class  the majority of which was written in california  the company has experienced adverse development primarily for accident years and as a result of significant growth in this book of business in a challenging business environment  the company s writings in this class were relatively more subject to variability than are some of its more established and or stable lines of business 
although cumulative results through continue to be quite profitable for this book of business  there has been some deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to accident years and with respect to active business classes  the company actively manages the collection  auditing and analysis of loss data  and factors the resulting information into both its reserving processes and its prospective underwriting and pricing activities on as timely a basis as possible 
for years and prior  management believes that two factors had the most significant impact on loss development 
first  through the s  a number of industry and external factors  such as the propensity of courts to award large damage awards in liability cases  combined to increase loss frequency and severity to unexpectedly high levels 
second  contracts written prior to contained coverage terms which  for the company and the industry in general  have been interpreted by courts to provide coverage for a e exposures not contemplated by either the pricing or the initial reserving of the contracts 
legal developments during the s  and continuing to date  have necessitated additional reserving for such exposures on both a case basis and an incurred but not reported ibnr basis 
these factors were the primary reasons for the cumulative adverse development on the and prior calendar year reserves 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies asbestos and environmental exposures 
the change between and reflects the impact of a stop loss reinsurance agreement with mt 
mckinley  which was then a subsidiary of the prudential 
this stop loss agreement commenced in when the prudential sold the stock of the company in an initial public offering and hence recoveries under this coverage are attributed to the accident year 
as a result of this agreement  reserve development arising from claims incurred prior to july  january  as respects catastrophe losses was ceded under the agreement with no impact on net development  except for a modest retention  when the adverse development reflected for accident year and prior is considered in the context of the mitigating favorable development attributed to the accident year 
this coverage became an inter affiliate reinsurance transaction with the acquisition of mt 
mckinley in  which eliminated any subsequent impact on net reserve development 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition 
management believes that adequate provision has been made for the company s loss and lae reserves 
while there can be no assurance that reserves for and losses from these claims will not increase in the future  management believes that the company s existing reserves  reserving methodologies and retrocessional arrangements lessen the probability that any such increases would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
these statements regarding the company s loss reserves are forward looking statements within the meaning of the us federal securities laws and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions contained therein

the following table is derived from the ten year gaap loss development table above and summarizes the effect of reserve re estimates  net of reinsurance  on calendar year operations by accident year for the same ten year period ended december  each column represents the amount of reserve re estimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the re estimates are applicable

the reserve development by accident year reflected in the above table was generally the result of the same factors discussed above that caused the deficiencies shown in the ten year gaap loss development table 
development in accident years and prior principally reflect the impact of the liability award inflation and a e exposures discussed above 
the favorable development experienced for the accident year is due to stop loss reinsurance provided to the company at the time of its initial public offering  which  when established  was specifically intended to mitigate the impact of development on reserves at june  the adverse development experienced in the through accident years relates principally to casualty reinsurance  including professional liability classes and workers compensation insurance where  in retrospect  the company s initial estimates of losses were underestimated principally as the result of unanticipated variability in the underlying exposures 
the favorable development for accident years and relates primarily to favorable experience with respect to property reinsurance business 
the company s loss reserving methodologies continuously monitor the emergence of loss and loss development trends  seeking  on a timely basis  to both adjust reserves for the impact of trend shifts and to factor the impact of such shifts into its underwriting and pricing on a prospective basis

prior year incurred losses were million in and million in such losses were the result of the reserve development noted above  as well as inherent uncertainty in establishing loss and lae reserves 
reserves for asbestos and environmental losses and loss adjustment expenses the company s reserves include an estimate of the company s ultimate liability for a e claims for which ultimate value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques 
there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the company s potential losses from a e claims 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asbestos and environmental exposures and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
mt 
mckinley s book of direct a e exposed insurance is relatively small and homogenous 
the book is based principally on excess liability policies  thus the claim legal staff does not have to analyze exposure under many different policy forms  but rather can focus on a limited number of policies and policy forms 
as a result of this focused structure  the company believes that it is able to comprehensively analyze its exposures  allowing it to identify and analyze those claims on which it has unusual exposure  such as policies in which it may be exposed to pay expenses in addition to policy limits or non products asbestos claims  for concentrated ongoing attention 
the company aims to be actively engaged with every insured account posing significant potential asbestos exposure to mt 
mckinley 
such engagement can take the form of pursuing a final settlement  negotiation  litigation  or the monitoring of claim activity under settlement in place sip agreements 
sip agreements generally condition an insurer s payment upon the actual claim experience of the insured and may have annual payment caps or other measures to control the insurer s payments 
the company s mt 
mckinley operation is currently managing nine sip agreements  three of which were executed prior to the acquisition of mt 
mckinley in the company s preference with respect to coverage settlements is to execute settlements that call for a fixed schedule of payments  because such settlements eliminate future uncertainty 
the company has significantly enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure characteristics over time  as well as its analysis by insured for those it considers to be more exposed or active 
those insureds identified as relatively less exposed or active are subject to less rigorous  but still active management  with an emphasis on monitoring those characteristics  which may indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity 
the company continually focuses on further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes used to evaluate potential exposure of policyholders  including those that may not have reported significant a e losses 
everest re s book of assumed reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a modest number of a e exposed relationships 
because the book of business is relatively concentrated and the company has been managing the a e exposures for many years  its claim staff is familiar with the ceding companies that have generated most of these liabilities in the past and which are therefore most likely to generate future liabilities 
the company s claim staff has developed familiarity both with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies and the claims handling and reserving practices of those companies 
this level of familiarity enhances the quality of the company s analysis of its exposure through those companies 
as a result  the company believes that it can identify those claims on which it has unusual exposure  such as non products asbestos claims  for concentrated attention 
however  in setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities  the company relies on claims data supplied by its ceding companies and brokers 
this information is not always timely or accurate and can impact the accuracy and timeliness of ultimate loss projections

additional reserves are case specific reserves determined by the company to be needed over and above those reported by the ceding company 
additional losses  including those relating to latent injuries and other exposures  which are as yet unrecognized  the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by either the company or the industry  may emerge in the future 
such future emergence could have material adverse effects on the company s future financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
future policy benefit reserves future policy benefit liabilities for annuities are reported at the accumulated fund balance of these contracts 
reserves for those liabilities include both mortality and morbidity provisions with respect to life and annuity claims  both reported and unreported 
actual experience in a particular period may be worse than assumed experience and  consequently  may adversely affect the company s operating results for the period 
see note f of notes to consolidated financial statements 
activity in the reserve for future policy benefits is summarized as follows years ended december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of year    liabilities assumed  adjustments to reserves    benefits paid in the current year    contract terminations  balance at end of year    investments the company s overall financial strength and results of operations are  in part  dependent on the quality and performance of its investment portfolio 
net investment income and net realized capital gains losses on the company s invested assets constituted   and of the company s revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s cash and invested assets totaled billion at december   which consisted of fixed maturities of which were investment grade  equity securities and other invested assets 
the company s current investment strategy seeks to maximize after tax income  through a high quality  diversified  taxable bond and tax preferenced fixed maturity portfolio  while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity 
the company s mix of taxable and tax preferenced investments is adjusted continuously  consistent with the company s current and projected operating results  market conditions and tax position 
additionally  the company invests in equity securities  which it believes will enhance the risk adjusted total return of the investment portfolio 
the board of directors of each of the company s operating subsidiaries is responsible for establishing investment policy and guidelines and  together with senior management  for overseeing their execution 
the company s investment portfolio is in compliance with the insurance laws of the jurisdictions in which its subsidiaries are regulated 
generally  an independent investment advisor is utilized to manage the company s fixed income investment portfolio within the established guidelines and is required to report activities on a current basis and to meet with the company periodically to review and discuss the portfolio structure  securities selection and performance results 
the company manages directly its investments in its equity and other invested asset portfolios 
the company s investment guidelines include a general duration guideline of five to six years 
the duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security but also reflects the payment of interest and the possibility of early prepayment of such security 
this investment duration guideline is established and periodically revised by management  which considers economic and business factors 
an important factor considered by management is the company s average duration of potential liabilities  which  at december   is estimated at approximately years based on the estimated payouts of underwriting liabilities using standard duration calculations 
the duration of the fixed income portfolio at december  was years 
the company made a decision to shorten duration during the second half of by purchasing interest only strips of mortgaged back securities interest only strips 
the interest only strips give the holder the right to receive interest payments at a stated coupon rate on an underlying pool of mortgages 
the interest payments on the outstanding mortgages are guaranteed by entities generally rated aaa 
the ultimate cash flow from these investments is primarily dependent upon the average life of the underlying mortgage pool 
generally  as market interest rates and more specifically market mortgage rates decline  mortgagees tend to refinance  which will decrease the average life of a mortgage pool and decrease expected cash flows 
conversely  as market interest rates and more specifically market mortgage rates rise  repayments will slow and the ultimate cash flows will tend to rise 
accordingly  the market value of these investments tends to increase as general interest rates rise and decline as general interest rates fall 
these movements are generally counter to the impact of interest rate movements on the company s other fixed income investments 
as interest rates peaked during the second quarter of the company liquidated its portfolio of interest only strips causing duration to rise back to the present levels 
such investments contributed to the year duration at december  for each currency in which the company has established substantial reserves  the company seeks to maintain invested assets denominated in such currency in an amount approximately comparable to the estimated liabilities 
approximately of the company s consolidated reserves for losses and lae and unearned premiums represent estimated amounts payable in foreign currencies 
as of december   of the company s total investments and cash were comprised of fixed maturity investments or cash and of the company s fixed maturities consisted of investment grade securities 
the average maturity of fixed maturities was years at december   and their overall duration was years 
as of december   the company did not have any investments in commercial real estate or direct commercial mortgages or any material holdings of derivative investments or securities of issuers that are experiencing cash flow difficulty to an extent that the company s management believes could threaten the issuer s ability to meet debt service payments  except where other than temporary impairments have been recognized 
as of december   the company s common stock portfolio  which is comprised primarily of publicly traded equity index funds  had a market value of million  comprising of total investments and cash

subsidiaries other than everest re and bermuda re may not be rated by some or any rating agencies because such ratings are not considered essential by the individual subsidiary s customers or because of the limited nature of the subsidiary s operations

am best standard poor s moody s senior notes a a a trust preferred securities a bbb baal a debt rating of a or a is assigned by am best where the issuer  in am best s opinion  has a strong ability to meet the terms of the obligation 
the a and a ratings are the sixth and seventh highest of ratings assigned by am best  which range from aaa to ccc 
a debt rating of a is assigned by standard poor s where the obligor has a strong capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation  although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rated categories 
standard poor s assigns a debt rating of bbb to issues that exhibit adequate protection parameters although adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
the a and bbb ratings from standard poor s are the seventh and ninth highest of ratings assigned by standard poor s  which range from aaa to d 
according to moody s  a debt rating of a is assigned to issues that are considered upper medium grade obligations and subject to low credit risk 
obligations rated baa are subject to moderate credit risk and are considered medium grade and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics 
the a and baa ratings are the seventh and eighth highest of ratings assigned by moody s  which range from aaa to c 
all of the above mentioned ratings are continually monitored and revised  if necessary  by each of the rating agencies 
the company believes that its ratings  in general  have become increasingly important to its operations because they provide the company s customers and investors with an independent assessment of the company s underlying financial strength using a scale that provides for relative comparisons 
competition the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive yet cyclical by product and market 
competition with respect to the types of reinsurance and insurance business in which the company is engaged is based on many factors  including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer  ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by am best and or standard poor s  underwriting expertise  the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized  capacity and coverages offered  premiums charged  other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered  services offered  speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written 
these factors operate at the individual market participant level to varying degrees as applicable to the specific participant s circumstances 
they also operate in aggregate across the reinsurance industry more generally contributing  in combination with background economic conditions and variations in the reinsurance buying practices of insurance companies  by participant and in the aggregate  to cyclical movements in reinsurance rates  terms and conditions and ultimately reinsurance industry aggregate financial results 
the company competes in the us  bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous international and domestic reinsurance and insurance companies 
the company s competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies  subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies  reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations  including underwriting syndicates at lloyd s 
some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company and have established long term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry  which can be a significant competitive advantage 
in addition  the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provides an additional source of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition 
in  the favorable market conditions  which had developed during through  generally began to weaken 
there were signs that pricing for most property classes declined modestly and that pricing for most casualty classes softened 
competition increased  in part due to the relative profitability achieved by many reinsurers over and and the attendant buildup of capital in these participants 
however  this profitability and capital buildup varied significantly by market participant  reflecting the fact that the industry generally still remained exposed to fundamental issues that had negatively impacted its aggregate capacity in and  including weak investment market conditions and adverse loss emergence 
both of these had tended to depress the industry s aggregate financial performance and perceptions of financial strength of industry participants over this period albeit with significant variation by individual market participant 
the industry experienced a record level of catastrophe losses during  particularly in the second half of the year  and it remains unclear whether the aggregate catastrophe losses experienced by the industry will reverse  stop or even moderate the trends toward market softening  particularly as respects property classes 
through  reinsurance and insurance markets had generally continued to firm  reflecting the continuing  although diminishing  implications of losses arising from the terrorist attacks of september   and more broadly  the impact of aggregate company reactions to broad and growing recognition that competition in the late s reached extremes in many classes and markets  which ultimately led to inadequate pricing and overly broad terms  conditions and coverages 
the effect of these extremes  which became apparent through excessive loss emergence  varied widely by company depending on product offerings  markets accessed  underwriting and operating practices  competitive strategies and business volumes 
across all market participants  however  the aggregate general effect was depressed financial results and erosion of the industry capital base 
coupled with deteriorating investment market conditions and results  and renewed concerns regarding longer term industry specific issues  including legacy reserve issues and sub par capital returns  these financial impacts introduced substantial  and in some cases extreme  pressure for the initiation and or strengthening of corrective action by individual market participants 
these pressures  aggregating across industry participants  reinforced the trend established in through toward firming prices  more restrictive terms and conditions  tightened coverage availability across most classes and markets and increasing concern with respect to the financial security of insurance and reinsurance providers  impacts which set the stage for the trends discussed above 
the company has been somewhat disappointed by industry developments in  which have generally operated to modestly weaken pricing 
the company can not predict with any reasonable certainty whether and to what extent these trends or conditions will persist and in particular whether the property catastrophe losses experienced by the industry in will lessen competitive pressures  particularly for the property classes of business 
notwithstanding these catastrophe losses  the continued growth of reinsurance capacity  particularly in bermuda  changes in the lloyd s market  and the potential reemergence of a market share orientation among some industry participants  combined with improving and in some cases strong financial results  continues to contribute to uncertainty about the prospective level of competitive pressures

at december   bermuda re and everest international met their solvency and liquidity requirements by a significant margin 
the payment of dividends to holdings by everest re is subject to limitations imposed by delaware law 
generally  everest re may only pay dividends out of its statutory earned surplus  which was  million at december   and only after it has given days prior notice to the delaware insurance commissioner 
during this day period  the commissioner may  by order  limit or disallow the payment of ordinary dividends if the commissioner finds the insurer to be presently or potentially in financial distress 
further  the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid without the prior approval of the delaware insurance commissioner in any twelve month period is the greater of of an insurer s statutory surplus as of the end of the prior calendar year or the insurer s statutory net income  not including realized capital gains  for the prior calendar year

naic risk based capital requirements 
the us national association of insurance commissioners naic employs a formula to measure the amount of capital appropriate for a property and casualty insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile 
the major categories of a company s risk profile are its asset risk  credit risk  and underwriting risk 
the standards are an effort by the naic to prevent insolvencies  to ward off other financial difficulties of insurance companies and to establish uniform regulatory standards among state insurance departments 
under the approved formula  a company s statutory surplus is compared to its risk based capital rbc 
if this ratio is above a minimum threshold  no action is necessary 
below this threshold are four distinct action levels at which a regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over a domestic insurer as the ratio of surplus to rbc decreases 
the mildest intervention requires the company to submit a plan of appropriate corrective actions 
the most severe action requires the company to be rehabilitated or liquidated 
based on their financial positions at december   everest re  everest national  everest indemnity and everest security exceed the minimum thresholds
