diagnostic industry overview clinical diagnostic tests are used to analyze samples of patients bodily fluids such as whole blood  blood plasma  serum or urine in a clinical setting 
in a single test  a patient sample may be measured to determine the presence  concentration or absence of a particular substance or condition 
in some tests  the fluid sample is combined with a dry or liquid chemical reagent  which is then observed or measured to detect physical or chemical changes that have a predetermined correlation to diagnostic information  which enables physicians to diagnose  treat and monitor patients 
the most common diagnostic tests are traditional routine clinical chemistry tests that measure substances such as glucose  cholesterol or sodium as part of routine blood checks 
other diagnostic tests measure other bodily functions such as blood clotting ability and cardiac function  or measure the presence of infections or drugs 
the wide range and important nature of these tests have established diagnostic testing as an integral part of the managed care environment  providing for accurate and timely patient diagnosis and treatment 
increasingly  diagnostic testing is recognized as making a significant contribution to improving patient care and lowering total patient costs 
diagnostic tests are performed in a number of different settings  including hospitals  reference laboratories  physicians offices ambulatory care centers  criminal justice system specialty labs and homes 
diagnostic testing systems are composed of instruments  reagents  consumables  service and data management components 
instruments serve to automate repetitive manual tasks  improve test accuracy and speed results reporting 
reagents are biochemical substances that react with the patient sample to produce measurable  objective results 
the consumable accessories vary across application segments  but are generally items such as vessels used in generating test results 
reagents and consumables that are exclusive to their related testing systems represent closed systems  which generally provide more predictable future revenue to the system supplier 
open systems accept reagents and consumables from more than a single manufacturer 
sample handling and preparation devices  as well as data management systems  are becoming increasingly important components of the clinical diagnostic system 
these additional system components permit laboratories to achieve cost efficiencies and higher test volumes 
improving productivity is a focus area for many labs given the ongoing cost pressures within the healthcare industry and the growing shortage of qualified labor to work in clinical labs 
the global clinical diagnostics market is estimated at billion annually  with the united states  western europe and japan comprising approximately  and  respectively  of the global market 
we primarily serve the clinical laboratory market  which comprises billion of the billion global clinical diagnostics market 
we believe that the global clinical diagnostics market will continue to grow due to a number of key favorable industry trends  including demographic shifts resulting from the aging of the population and socioeconomic improvements which are expected to increase the overall level of demand for diagnostic testing  increased focus on lowering total healthcare expenditures that will likely increase demand for diagnostic testing as an effective tool to improve patient outcomes and reduce the costs of misdiagnosis through earlier and more accurate diagnosis and patient monitoring  emerging markets that will likely provide additional demand as economic growth in these countries lead to increased per capita healthcare expenditures  technology improvements in new tests  pathogens and markers that will likely result in the increased use of diagnostics to aid in the diagnosis of diseases  and increased automation of diagnostic instruments that is expected to lower the overall cost of diagnostic testing and thereby increase accessibility and demand 
dade behring served markets we derive substantially all of our revenues from manufacturing and marketing clinical diagnostics products and services 
we are organized functionally and are comprised of three reporting segments global customer management gcm americas  gcm international  and global operations 
gcm americas and gcm international are our sales  marketing  customer training  technical support and field service organizations 
global operations primarily includes all manufacturing  distribution and research and development activities  and accordingly does not recognize significant revenue 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for information related to risks from our operations outside the us and segment and geographic area financial information  respectively 
this and the following sections discuss our served markets whose results are reported in the gcm americas and gcm international segments 
chemistry 
our chemistry business consists of four product lines routine chemistry immunochemistry  cardiac  plasma proteins and drugs of abuse testing therapeutic drug monitoring 
these product lines contributed approximately billion or to our revenue during the clinical laboratory chemistry immunochemistry testing segment represents over billion of the total clinical diagnostics market 
routine chemistry immunochemistry 
routine chemistry tests measure substances found in large concentrations in patients blood  tissue  urine or other bodily fluids 
some of these substances include chemistry tests such as cholesterol  glucose  iron and sodium and their concentration levels provide information on a patient s basic bodily functions 
routine immunochemistry testing relies on the properties of antibodies and antigens in the immune system as its key detection mechanism 
immunoassays  which are immunochemistry tests  measure relatively low concentrations of these substances found in blood 
historically  analyzers had been developed separately for routine chemistry and immunochemistry testing 
today  high volume tests in both categories are rapidly being consolidated onto a single system that significantly improves overall laboratory productivity and costs 
on average  hospital laboratories operate approximately three routine chemistry immunochemistry analyzers 
these instruments account for up to of the volume of all diagnostic tests performed in clinical laboratories and are characterized by their high throughput capabilities 
we market and sell routine chemistry immunochemistry instruments under our dimension brand name 
we have consistently been a leader in chemistry immunochemistry instrument consolidation and automation  beginning with the introduction of the heterogeneous module for our mid volume dimension rxl analyzer 
in we introduced the dimension xpand analyzer  which provides the same testing consolidation capability as the dimension rxl analyzer for smaller labs 
the continued consolidation of routine chemistry and immunochemistry testing onto a single analyzer continues to represent a significant growth opportunity for us 
we believe that our dimension line of products offers customers a broad test menu  technological efficiencies over competitive systems  and the lowest total cost solution for performing these two categories of tests since the analyzers have the potential to improve test turnaround times and significantly reduce labor requirements in the laboratory 
we are continually enhancing our existing menu of over tests  and we are developing new ones to expand our capabilities in this largest segment of the clinical diagnostics market 
in  we introduced the dimension rxlmax analyzer  the most recent version of our mid volume chemistry immunochemistry analyzer  which included several significant system improvements 
similarly  at the end of  we introduced our latest low volume system  the dimension xpand plus analyzer  which included enhancements similar to our mid volume instrument 
in  we introduced the streamlab workcell  which had the capability to connect up to four dimension systems with onboard pre analytical capabilities of accessioning  centrifugation and aliquotting 
the streamlab workcell automates steps that are essential to laboratory processes for producing test results 
at the end of  we further enhanced the streamlab workcell by providing connectivity for up to six dimension systems and to the immulite immunoassay systems manufactured by diagnostics products corporation 
this workcell provides our customers in high volume laboratories an integrated single platform solution 
our approach to workstation consolidation is unique  integrating the immunoassay  or ia  detection capability into the chemistry analyzer itself rather than simply connecting separate chemistry and ia instruments with a common patient sample test tube handling system 
integration of testing into one analyzer provides greater asset productivity  lower labor costs and faster turnaround times 
our strong reputation for servicing our instruments and our commitment to improving operating efficiency are among the reasons why the dimension product line remains attractive to clinical laboratories 
staffing and budget concerns in clinical laboratories worldwide suggest that laboratory process integration and instrument consolidation will become even more compelling to our customers over time 
building on our success in workstation consolidation  we are currently developing a next generation system for high volume laboratories named the dimension vista system 
the initial version of the system will serve the high volume testing segment  which represents nearly half of the billion chemistry immunochemistry testing market  and the system architecture will provide the basic building blocks for new consolidated instruments designed to serve the mid and low volume laboratories 
we currently do not have a product offering that specifically serves the high volume chemistry immunochemistry market 
in addition to targeting further labor efficiencies in the lab  the dimension vista system will also have the unique capability of consolidating a currently independent testing discipline  nephelometric plasma protein testing  by integrating a nephelometer into the system 
we anticipate commercialization of the dimension vista system in the second half of see factors that could affect future results at the end of item for a discussion of risk factors related to the release of new products 
cardiac 
cardiac tests are used for both risk assessment and diagnosis of cardiovascular disease cvd 
the cardiac market is one of the highest growth segments of the broader immunochemistry market  growing at approximately annually 
we have a leading share in the market for cardiac tests and were one of the first to introduce a widely adopted testing system for the cardiac proteins troponin i  ck mb and myoglobin 
in we introduced the nt probnp test for our dimension systems  a rapidly growing cardiac marker used to assist physicians in the diagnosis of congestive heart failure chf 
the combination of rapid and accurate tests for these cvd markers has allowed for rapid diagnosis of cardiac disease and has enhanced the physician s ability for triage and diagnosis of chest pain in patients 
we offer a unique combination of platforms for performing cardiac tests 
in the central laboratory  the dimension analyzers  bn ii  and bn prospec analyzers offer tests for cardiac risk assessment such as cholesterol  hdl  ldl  apolipoprotein  and high sensitivity crp 
we have led the development of the market for high sensitivity crp testing for cardiac application 
in addition to cardiac risk assessment tests  the dimension analyzers menu also includes the four major cardiac disease tests troponin i  ck mb  myoglobin for cardiac necrosis  and nt probnp for helping in the diagnosis of chf 
in the acute care near patient setting  we offer cardiac testing on our stratus cs acute care diagnostic system 
this system provides dade behring with a unique position in the market  being able to standardize cardiac testing between its laboratory and acute care platforms 
it is important to physicians to have the confidence that the results from the acute care platform will clinically match those that come from the laboratory 
launched in  the stratus cs analyzer represents the industry s first quantitative  near patient cardiac instrument 
the stratus cs system s rapid result time of approximately minutes in the acute care setting provides physicians with cardiac test results in under the minute recommendation of cardiac societies such as american heart association  american college of cardiologists  and european society of cardiologists 
the analytical performance sensitivity of nanograms per milliliter and precision of coefficient of variation at the th percentile of normal of the stratus cs acute care troponin i test along with its rapid results  offers significant potential cost savings for healthcare providers and improves patient outcomes by identifying acute coronary syndrome acs patients faster and more accurately 
currently  the average cost to rule out myocardial infarction in a patient with chest pain ranges from  to  the stratus cs analyzer can achieve a result in approximately minutes at a cost of less than per test  which saves significant time over conventional diagnostic measures  reduces hospital lengths of stay  avoids unnecessary testing and thereby reduces healthcare costs significantly 
the stratus cs analyzer menu also includes the acute care d dimer test  which has been shown to aid in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism pe 
pe patients often present the same symptoms as acs patients 
the combination of d dimer testing with other cardiac testing enables the physician to better differentiate the cause of a patient s chest pain allowing for proper treatment of the patient 
we anticipate adding the nt probnp test to the stratus cs menu in early plasma protein 
plasma protein systems test serum  plasma  urine or cerebral spinal fluid to help diagnose diseases  such as coronary heart diseases and rheumatic diseases  as well as to detect disorders  such as tumors  renal failure and malnutrition 
plasma protein tests are conducted on two types of instrument platforms  routine chemistry immunochemistry analyzers such as our dimension instrument line and dedicated nephelometers such as our bn ii and bn prospec instruments 
while a higher proportion of protein tests are run on routine chemistry immunochemistry systems  the high sensitivity and broad test menu make nephelometers a practical option for customers who need this utility 
we are the market leader in the worldwide nephelometric plasma protein testing 
we offer four dedicated plasma protein analyzers the bn ii analyzer  targeted at high volume hospital and commercial labs  the bn and bn prospec analyzers  sold to low and mid volume labs  and the turbitime system  a manual instrument sold to low volume hospitals and private labs 
the bn ii analyzer  released in  continues to be successful in the market because of its high reliability  broad test menu and competitive throughput capabilities 
we launched the bn prospec analyzer in it has also been well received by customers for similar reasons and we have made over  placements worldwide 
we offer a broad test menu of over assays and applications  which covers a wide spectrum of plasma protein tests 
we also offer some key innovative nephelometric assays such as high sensitivity crp cardiophase hs crp  cystatin c  enhanced sensitive csf assays for igm and iga and soluble transferrin receptor stfr 
in  our high sensitivity crp hs crp assay was the first to receive fda clearance for cardiovascular risk assessment and risk stratification claims 
when used in conjunction with traditional clinical laboratory evaluation of acute coronary syndromes acs  our cardiophase hs crp assay may be useful as an independent marker of prognosis for recurrent events in patients with stable coronary disease or acs 
the use of serum cystatin c as a marker of glomerular filtration rate gfr offers significant advantages over conventional methods for assessing renal functions in patients suspected of having kidney disease 
cystatin values are independent of gender and age 
it is also not affected by body mass  infections  diet or drugs 
because of the above  cystain c is a sensitive and reliable marker for gfr  which can be measured quickly on our bn system platforms 
the quantification of igm and iga proteins aids in the evaluation of patients immune response 
sensitive assays are very important and critical for diagnosis and treatment and we have developed and introduced in enhanced sensitive latex assays for igm and iga 
soluble transferrin receptor assay is useful in differentiation between iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease 
it is also useful for the assessment of iron status in athletes  during pregnancy  chronic inflammation or in malignant disease and in monitoring of erythropoetin therapy 
our nephelometric assay has been well received in the market 
given our long history of leadership in nephelometric protein testing  and our success at introducing and developing markets for critical  protein based immunoassays such as myoglobin and troponin i  we are aggressively assessing options for connecting our historical strength to the advances that we expect from proteomics research 
in addition to stepping up our licensing capabilities  we are evaluating our platform strategy to determine how the bn prospec class analyzer and next generation dimension analyzers can be equipped to handle the sensitivity requirements of new markers that are discovered through proteomics research 
drugs of abuse testing dat therapeutic drug monitoring tdm 
drug tests are used to measure the level of therapeutic drugs or presence of drugs of abuse  usually in either blood or urine 
tdm tests assist physicians in ensuring that the level of therapeutic drugs patients receive do not exceed safe ranges in the bloodstream 
an example of a tdm application is testing performed on transplant patients to monitor the level of immunosuppressive drugs that they are given 
drugs of abuse tests screen for the presence of illicit substances such as cocaine and marijuana 
because of their range of application  drugs tests are used at a variety of sites  from clinical laboratories to employers offices 
we are a worldwide market leader in drug testing with a comprehensive menu of tests 
dade behring offers drug tests on its dimension analyzers 
in  we also began marketing the mid to high volume v twin analyzer for the syva product line  and in we began marketing the mid volume viva e analyzer 
these systems are manufactured by vital scientific nv and distributed worldwide by us 
both are configured to run our emit branded drugs of abuse and serum toxicology assays  as well as specimen validity tests 
vital scientific is developing an easy to use  compact benchtop analyzer dedicated to drug testing  which we expect to begin marketing in late or early we also have ready to use liquid dat reagents for a broad range of other commercially available instrument platforms 
this makes syva an attractive choice for dat assays among open system reagent providers 
hemostasis 
hemostasis testing measures a patient s ability to form and dissolve blood clots  a critical factor in the stabilization of the cardiovascular system 
hemostasis testing can be segmented into routine screening and specialty tests 
routine hemostasis tests are typically performed before and during surgical procedures 
hemostasis testing is also essential in post surgical treatments for patients with cardiovascular disorders such as monitoring treatments to thin the blood to prevent clotting  and for patients with coagulation disorders such as hemophilia 
specialty tests are performed to further characterize congenital disease states 
with revenue of approximately million during  we continued to maintain a global leadership position in hemostasis testing through our commitment to innovation of new and improved products and services 
we offer a broad range of instruments which perform both routine and specialty tests to meet the needs of customers from small hospitals to large reference labs 
the hemostasis product line continues to lead competitors in number of new systems placed  and in overall reagent usage and marketshare 
dade behring offers its bcs analyzer to high volume and specialty assay labs  and distributes instruments manufactured by sysmex corporation to the high volume routine assay reference lab market and to mid volume laboratories  such as community hospitals 
d dimer testing is the most important recent assay advancement in the field of hemostasis testing due to its negative predictive value in ruling out clot formation 
dade behring s advanced d dimer assay d dimer plus outside us is an aid in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolic diseases  such as deep vein thrombosis dvt and pulmonary embolism pe 
our instrument offering allows labs of all sizes to offer this important assay as part of their coagulation testing menu 
the pfa analyzer is a fully automated system which determines platelet function by mimicking how platelets adhere  aggregate  and form a plug in the presence of an agonist  either collagen adp or collagen epinephrine 
the result is known as closure time  and has utility as an excellent screen for the bleeding disorder von willebrand s disease  as well as new cardiac utility in measuring platelets functional response to aspirin 
we believe this will be a high growth market as new anti platelet therapies are developed and introduced 
market growth is expected to come from a continued growth in the number of surgeries performed as well as from new hemostasis tests  which more accurately measure blood clotting and allow for improved patient treatment 
since hemostasis is a critical component of cardiovascular disease treatment  pharmaceutical companies are currently conducting significant research directed at modulating hemostasis  which could lead to either increased or decreased testing as new pharmaceuticals are introduced 
microbiology 
we serve the automated and manual identification antibiotic susceptibility testing id ast microbiology market with our microscan products 
microbiology laboratories use microscan products to identify infection causing bacteria such as streptococci and staphylococci  and to determine the minimum concentration of antibiotic such as erythromycin and ampicillin  necessary to inhibit or kill the bacteria

in the united states  we continue to secure business through the promotion of our conventional technology  which utilizes direct susceptibility testing methods and results in optimal detection of emerging antimicrobial resistance 
microscan systems were the first automated systems to detect both vancomycin intermediate and vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus during routine testing  thus demonstrating our leadership in providing highly accurate susceptibility test results 
in  we introduced our synergies plus panels  which offer hour organism identification and read when ready antibiotic susceptibility test results 
this new line of panels and software will provide more rapid test results on those organisms slow to express resistance and enhance patient outcomes  without compromising our reputation for accuracy 
continued evolutions in the microbiology testing market have been driven primarily by advances in automation  new antibiotics  the complexity of various microbes  and the increasing resistance of microbes to antibiotics 
infectious disease diagnostics 
infectious disease diagnostic systems test for the presence of infectious microorganisms 
this market consists of bacteriology  parasitology and virology testing  including hiv and hepatitis testing 
these tests are used not only to diagnose disease  but also as screening tests in order to insure a safe blood supply 
we have a niche position in infectious disease diagnostics 
infectious disease testing is one of the largest segments of the diagnostics testing market  but accounted for approximately million or of our revenue during the microtitre plate  or mtp  subsegment  manual and semi automated  makes up approximately one third of the immunoassay testing in this segment 
mtp is a high throughput  low cost testing method  ideal for blood banks 
in the european mtp segment  our bep systems are used by more laboratories than any other batch analyzer 
in addition  we possess a strong intellectual property position for hiv o  a variant of hiv recently discovered 
due to the increased prevalence of hiv o  any future hiv testing platform will need to include hiv o to offer comprehensive hiv testing capability 
we continue to invest in expanded test menu capabilities for our existing instrument line and launched our bep and quadriga instruments in and  respectively  to allow us to better serve the high volume blood bank market 
these instruments have met with positive acceptance in a number of european blood banks

our test menu development efforts seek to improve the efficacy of existing products and to develop new tests that extend our existing product offerings 
our research and development teams are skilled in a number of engineering and scientific disciplines including focus areas of chemistry immunochemistry  microbiology  hemostasis  informatics  applying robotics to sample processing and systems engineering 
our products are developed internally using a multifunctional team approach which integrates our internal capabilities of engineering and assay development with regulatory and quality systems  marketing  technical support and manufacturing 
although we continue to develop or license all of our hemostasis reagents and controls  in recent years  new hemostasis instruments have been sourced through an external instrumentation partner using a similar approach 
research and development expense was million in  as compared to million in and million in patents  trademarks and licenses we own or have licensed over  patents in the united states and other countries that relate to our products and businesses and have also developed brand names and trademarks for our products 
we own numerous united states and non us registered trademarks and service marks and have applications for the registration of trademarks and service marks pending around the world 
we also own several united states copyright registrations 
in addition  we own a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know how 
further  we license certain intellectual property rights from third parties 
our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property 
in each of our business segments  these patents  patent applications  trademarks  copyrights and licenses are  in the aggregate  of significant importance to our business 
however  we believe that no single patent  trademark or copyright or related group of patents  trademarks or copyrights is material in relation to our business as a whole 
competition the clinical diagnostics industry is highly competitive  however  there are substantial barriers to entry including the necessity for significant sales  service and distribution infrastructure  research and development infrastructure that requires engineering and informatics skills necessary to design and commercialize complex instruments and the life science skills necessary to develop the diagnostic tests  and finally the highly regulated environment for our products 
we encounter competition from u 
s and non us manufacturers who compete in some or all of the markets we serve 
some of our competitors are large diversified healthcare companies with substantial resources 
we believe that in recent years  the key competitive factors for diagnostic testing products have been quality  service  price and ease of use 
for automated and consolidated instrument platforms  menu breadth is of increasing importance 
our competitors include abbott laboratories  bayer ag  beckman coulter  becton dickinson  biomerieux  johnson johnson  roche and diagnostica stago 
regulatory matters most aspects of our business are subject to some degree of government regulation in the countries in which we operate 
in addition to regulations intended to ensure product safety and effectiveness  our business is subject to regulation concerned with protecting the environment and occupational health and safety 
for some products  and in some countries  government regulation is significant and  in general  there is a trend towards more stringent regulation 
our policy is to comply fully with all regulatory requirements applying to our products and operations 
governmental regulatory actions can result in the recall or seizure of products  suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for production or sale  and other civil  monetary and criminal sanctions 
in the united states  the medical device and clinical diagnostic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal  state and local agencies  primarily regarding product manufacturing  safety  efficacy and labeling 
government agencies in the united states as well as other countries have expressed concern about costs of health care and in some cases have focused attention on diagnostic test utilization 
regulations in these areas already exist in some countries and may be expanded significantly in the united states and other countries in the future 
we devote significant time  effort and expense to address regulatory requirements applicable to our business 
our quality and regulatory compliance training and well established manufacturing practices have consistently allowed us to successfully introduce and maintain the manufacturing and distribution of instrument and reagent products that satisfy regulatory standards as well as our customers requirements for quality 
although we are unable to predict the extent to which our business may be affected by future regulatory developments  we expect that our own business would not be disproportionately burdened by future regulation 
we believe that the integration we have achieved between our engineering and life sciences capabilities and our substantial experience addressing and accommodating regulatory requirements and restrictions on our operations throughout the world will allow us to continue to develop and introduce new and improved products and enable us to compete effectively within this environment 
raw materials we purchase raw materials  which include various biological and chemical products from a variety of suppliers 
while some of our principal raw materials are available from multiple sources  for various reasons eg  quality assurance  cost effectiveness or regulatory approval requirements  we elect to purchase certain raw materials from sole suppliers 
other raw materials used are not available from multiple sources 
in some cases where there are regulatory requirements relating to qualification of suppliers  we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis 
while we work closely with our suppliers to ensure continuity of supply  the termination  reduction or interruption in supply of these sole sourced raw materials could affect our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products and to achieve anticipated production and sales levels 
employees as of january   we had approximately  full time and part time employees of which approximately  were in the united states with the remainder serving at various locations outside of the united states 
our us employees are not represented by collective bargaining groups

factors that could affect future results because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
our failure to compete with other manufacturers in the highly competitive clinical diagnostics industry  some of which have greater financial resources than we do  could harm our ability to retain existing customers and obtain future business 
the clinical diagnostics industry is highly competitive and we encounter competition from several international manufacturers in both us and non us markets 
some of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater resources  financial and other  than we do 
moreover  we encounter different competitors in each of our key product lines and we cannot assure you that we will not encounter increased competition in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our profit margins and business approach may be adversely affected by potential healthcare reform 
substantially all of our sales are in the clinical diagnostics industry 
healthcare reform and the growth of managed care organizations have been considerable forces in the diagnostics industry 
these forces continue to place constraints on the levels of overall pricing and thus could have a material adverse effect on the profit margins of our products 
such continuing changes in the united states healthcare market could also force us to alter our approach to selling  marketing  distributing and servicing our customer base 
in and outside the united states  including germany and japan in particular  changes to government reimbursement policies could reduce the funding that healthcare service providers have available for diagnostic product expenditures  which could have a material adverse impact on our sales and or profit margin 
we make significant investments in research and development  but there is no guarantee that any of these investments will ultimately result in a commercial product that will generate revenues 
our products require the integration of many component systems and processes including electromechanical  information systems  and biochemical reactions or assays 
each year we expend significant resources in the development of new products that incorporate these systems 
for the year ended december   we spent approximately million on research and development expenses 
notwithstanding these investments  we may be unable to successfully design or develop any or all of these components or to integrate them into viable commercial systems 
we might also encounter substantial delays in getting products to market in a timely fashion 
changes in our business strategy or plans may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
if our business strategy or plans change  whether in response to changes in economic conditions or developments in the diagnostics industry  or otherwise  we may be required to expend significantly more resources than planned to develop and implement any new business strategy or plans 
the expense of such change could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations 
approximately of our sales and a significant portion of our earnings are attributable to operations conducted outside of the united states 
the united states dollar value of sales and earnings of these operations varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations 
changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal obligations on our united states dollar denominated debt 
our planned hedging of other currencies against the united states dollar may not adequately reduce exposure to currency exchange fluctuation 
our ability to compete depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we own or license over  united states and non us patents and have numerous patent applications pending around the world 
we own numerous united states and non us registered trademarks and service marks and have applications for the registration of trademarks and service marks pending around the world 
we also own several united states copyright registrations 
in addition  we own a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know how 
further  we license certain intellectual property rights from third parties 
our ability to compete depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property 
there can be no assurance as to the degree of protection offered by the various patents  the likelihood that patents will be issued on pending patent applications  or  with regard to the licensed intellectual property  that the licenses will not be terminated 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not develop around the patented aspects of any of our current or proposed products  independently develop technology or know how that is the same as or competitive with our technology and know how or otherwise obtain access to our intellectual property 
if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and our significant current or proposed products  our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we are subject to regulation by various us federal  state and us agencies  which requires us to comply with regulations in the design  manufacture and distribution of most of our products and violation of such regulations could adversely affect us 
most of our products and operations are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  and various other federal and state agencies  as well as by a number of non us governmental agencies 
fda regulations require that most of our new products have pre marketing approval by the fda  or prove substantial equivalence through a k notification and also require that most of our products be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practices 
some products and operations are also subject to regulation by the united states drug enforcement agency  or dea  and various other federal and state agencies  including the united states department of agriculture  or usda  as well as by a number of non us governmental agencies 
dea regulations require that we obtain dea registrations for the bulk manufacture and handling of controlled substances  and maintain effective controls against diversion 
the usda regulates the importation of animal sourced materials and the treatment and handling of animals utilized to derive biological materials used in research or production 
compliance with such regulations substantially increases the time  difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining the approval to manufacture and market newly developed and existing products 
in addition  government regulatory actions can result in the seizure or recall of products  suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for their production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions 
we are subject to various environmental and occupational health and safety laws and any violation of these laws could result in liability that could adversely affect us 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations around the globe and are subject to liabilities and compliance costs associated with past and current handling  processing  storing and disposing of hazardous substances and wastes 
our operations are also subject to federal  state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations in and outside the united states 
this requires us to devote significant resources to maintain compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations and manage environmental risks

the following table presents our selected historical consolidated financial data as of and for the period ended october   and for each of the years in the two year period ended december  for the predecessor company as defined below and as of and for the period ended december  and each of the years in the two year period ended december  for the successor company as defined below  derived from audited consolidated financial statements 
the results of operations for any period less than one year are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for a full year 
the selected historical data should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and other information contained elsewhere in this report  including the information set forth under the heading management s discussions and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
as discussed previously  the debtors filed for bankruptcy protection and emerged on october  although the plan of reorganization became effective on october   for financial reporting convenience purposes  we recorded the adjustments necessitated by the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code sop on october  as a result of our emergence from chapter bankruptcy and the application of fresh start reporting  our consolidated financial statements for the periods commencing on october  are referred to as the successor company and are not comparable with any periods prior to october   which are referred to as the predecessor company

net income for the period ended october  which represents the period from january  through october  includes a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the following 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations which  among other things  requires that upon adoption  unamortized negative goodwill be written off as a change in accounting principle 
unamortized negative goodwill at december  aggregated million and was recognized as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on january  net loss for the period ended december  which represents the period from october  through december  includes million of incremental expense associated with the sale of inventory stepped up due to the application of fresh start reporting and million of costs relating to management stock grants

net income for the year ended december  includes million of costs relating to stock based compensation 
in consideration of the issuance of emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs are recorded as a component of net revenue 
prior to the third quarter of  these amounts were reported as a reduction of operating expense 
a reclassification of all prior period balances has been made to conform to the current presentation 
effective january   we changed our revenue recognition policy to conform to staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and accordingly recorded a million charge representing the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle 
we have recorded all incremental professional and bank fees associated with the reorganization of our balance sheet incurred prior to the bankruptcy filing on august  in this separate line item on our consolidated statement of operations 
reorganization items for the period ended october  include the gain on discharge of debt under the plan of reorganization million  and the impact of revaluing our assets and liabilities as required by fresh start reporting million  offset by the two items discussed next in this note 
we have recorded all incremental professional fees and other costs associated with the reorganization of our balance sheet incurred after the bankruptcy filing in this separate line item on our consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  on september   baxter healthcare corporation baxter filed objections to our plan of reorganization 
baxter objected to the adequacy of the disclosure statement filed with the bankruptcy court and to confirmation of the plan of reorganization on a number of bases 
on september   we agreed to settle all matters with baxter for million  such claim to be treated as a general unsecured claim under the plan of reorganization 
this settlement is included in reorganization items for the period ended october  for the period ended december   reorganization items include only professional fees

on january   goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will no longer be subject to amortization  but rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
as of january   there was no material impact caused by the initial impairment assessment requirements of sfas no

adjustment adjusted item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
in the discussion below  we make comparisons on a constant currency basis  which is not a us gaap defined measure 
we believe this measure provides for a meaningful analysis of the underlying activity since it eliminates the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
when making comparisons on a constant currency basis  we have calculated the change by comparing the applicable reported current year amount to the corresponding amount from the prior year in local currency translated at the foreign currency exchange rates for the current year 
constant currency as defined or presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
results of operation we derive substantially all of our revenue from manufacturing and marketing clinical diagnostic products and services 
we are organized functionally and have three reporting segments global customer management gcm americas  gcm international and global operations 
gcm americas and gcm international are our sales and service organizations 
for our reporting purposes  americas includes north and south america 
international includes sales and service results from all other continents 
the gross profit margin for the two gcm segments are not materially different 
global operations primarily includes all manufacturing and research and development activities  which occur in the united states and germany  and accordingly does not recognize significant revenues 
global operations functions as a cost center 
consequently  a discussion of gross profit for each individual operating segment would not be meaningful 
generally  global operations does not incur a material amount of our marketing and administrative expense  but is responsible for virtually all research and development expense 
certain expenses  such as income taxes  general corporate expenses and financing costs  are not allocated to the operating segments 
effective january   we implemented changes to the gcm organizational structure 
accordingly  the reporting segments changed at that time 
the countries in south america and central america  as well as mexico  which were previously managed as part of gcm international  became part of gcm north america 
gcm north america was thus renamed gcm americas 
all periods presented conform to the current organizational structure 
bankruptcy proceedings on august   dade behring holdings  inc and certain of its wholly owned direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries dade behring inc  dade microscan inc  dade finance  inc  syva diagnostics holding co  syva childcare inc  syva company  and chimera research chemical  inc 
filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code  as amended  with the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois 
we collectively refer to the companies party to the bankruptcy proceedings as the debtors 
on august   the debtors filed their disclosure statement for their joint chapter plan of reorganization  which we call the plan of reorganization 
no other subsidiaries of dade behring holdings  inc filed for relief under the united states bankruptcy code 
the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan of reorganization on september  and the plan became effective on october  the plan of reorganization allowed the debtors to emerge from bankruptcy with an improved capital structure and  because the debtors were allowed to continue paying their trade debt on a timely basis during the pendency of the chapter cases  they had sufficient trade credit to continue their operations in the ordinary course of business 
on the effective date of the plan of reorganization  dade behring inc entered into new credit facilities 
see liquidity and capital resources credit facilities below for further discussion 
as a result of the plan of reorganization  significant changes resulted to our capital structure 
although the plan of reorganization became effective on october   for financial reporting convenience purposes  we recorded the adjustments necessitated by sop on october  as a result of our emergence from chapter bankruptcy and the application of fresh start reporting  our consolidated financial statements for the periods commencing on october  are referred to as the successor company and are not comparable with any periods prior to october   which are referred to as the predecessor company 
the effects of fresh start reporting and new accounting pronouncements see notes and to our consolidated financial statements resulted in a new basis of accounting for the predecessor company on october  all references to the period ended october  which represents the period from january  through october  are to the predecessor company 
all references to the years ended december  and and the period ended december  which represents the period from october  through december  are to the successor company 
the plan of reorganization and associated new senior credit agreement and capital structure provided for the following a restructuring of our debt occurred that reduced the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness by approximately million and converted that debt into equity 
this was accomplished by retiring existing senior debt and senior subordinated notes  issuing approximately  shares of new common stock  shares are currently authorized  and replacing the old debt with the new debt described below 
the new common stock was issued to the holders of existing senior debt  senior subordinated notes and management 
all preferred and common stock existing prior to the filing of the plan of reorganization  as well as all options  warrants  and rights to purchase or otherwise receive common stock existing prior to the filing of the plan of reorganization were cancelled 
management incentive plans were established that provided for issuing new common stock and granting new stock option awards to employees 
as of october   of our fully diluted new common equity consisting of  common shares was set aside for officers and certain other employees for the issuance of options and stock awards 
this was fully diluted after giving effect to the issuance of options and stock awards 
all stock awards provided for in the management incentive plans  totaling  shares  have been issued 
nearly all of the  option awards provided for in the management incentive plans have been issued 
see note  shareholders equity and redeemable preferred stock  for further information 
a new senior revolving credit facility in the amount of million no borrowings outstanding at december  and a new senior term loan facility of million million outstanding at december  both of which include the ability to borrow in euros were established collectively the credit facility 
new senior subordinated notes of million were issued million outstanding at december   which did not result in a cash infusion into the company 
during  and  our term loan facility was amended 
see note  debt  for further discussion 
reorganization value is defined by sop as the fair value of the entity before considering liabilities and approximates the amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets of the entity immediately after the restructuring 
our reorganization value was  million  which was less than the total postpetition liabilities and allowed claims of approximately  million 
as a result  we adopted fresh start reporting on october   as described earlier 
the reorganization value was derived by adding the fair value of all our liabilities million to our enterprise value  million 
the enterprise value can be defined as the total value of dade behring holdings  inc and our subsidiaries as a going concern ie the fair value of our assets  net of our liabilities excluding our bank debt and senior subordinated notes 
our enterprise value was determined based on consideration of many factors and by reliance on various valuation techniques  including comparable company analysis and two discounted cash flow analyses 
the factors considered included  but were not limited to  the following forecasted operating and cash flow results which gave effect to the estimated impact of the changes in our capital structure contemplated by the plan of reorganization  discounted cash flow analyses using an ebitda multiple or a perpetual growth rate to determine a terminal value  estimated values of our net operating loss carryforwards  consideration of market values of comparable companies  market share and position  and competition and general economic considerations 
successor company year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  totaled  million as compared to  million in the corresponding prior year period 
sales for each segment were as follows in millions year ended december  change gcm americas gcm international global operations total adjusting for the favorable impact of foreign currency rate changes of million  sales increased million or for the year 
on a constant currency basis  sales increased million or in gcm americas and increased million or across gcm international locations 
on a geographic basis  constant currency sales growth was in the us and across all us locations 
the overall sales increase on a constant currency basis can be attributed in part to a million or increase in core chemistry sales primarily driven by strong dimension product sales globally 
the growth can also be attributed in part to a million or increase in hemostasis product sales  with the strongest growth in gcm americas locations  offset by a million or decrease in sales of mature products other across all segments 
we define mature products as those products and services that we do not consider to be part of our core strategy and as a result  they are expected to have declining sales over time 
our worldwide installed base of instruments  an important indicator of future growth potential  grew during the year ended december  growth in the installed base of dimension rxl max and dimension xpand instruments as well as the bn prospec plasma protein instrument continue to drive much of the reagents  consumables and service sales growth seen in our core chemistry products 
gains in the hemostasis installed base have been driven by successes in ca  ca  ca  bct  bcs and pfa instrument placements 
for microbiology  new installations of our autoscan and walkaway series of instruments continue to provide growth 
beyond the installed base impact  reagents and consumables sales growth has benefited from improved method penetration  which results from utilizing an existing instrument base for additional tests 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased million to million as compared to million in the corresponding prior year period 
on a constant currency basis  gross profit increased million 
gross profit margin for the year ended december  was as compared to in the corresponding prior year period 
the percentage point margin improvement is attributable to percentage points of favorable foreign currency changes  percentage points of higher reagent  consumables and service revenue in proportion to instrument revenue  and percentage points of manufacturing cost efficiencies and favorable product mix 
our reagent  consumables and service revenue has a higher gross profit margin than instrument revenue 
growth in immunoassay and other specialty tests  which typically earn a higher margin than routine tests  also contributed to the improved gross profit margin 
marketing and administrative expenses 
marketing and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million to million  or of sales  as compared to million  or of sales  in the prior year 
of the total increase  million resulted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and million was due to incremental costs associated with our compliance efforts surrounding section of the sarbanes oxley act of these costs were partially offset by a reduction in stock based compensation expense of million from to the remaining million increase was due to costs to build our sales and marketing infrastructure for the dimension vista tm system and investments in current resources and processes to support the higher level of revenues being achieved 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  totaled million of sales and were higher than the prior year 
on a constant currency basis  research and development expenses increased million or over the corresponding prior year period as we make investments in new product development  such as the high volume dimension vista tm system and new assays for all product lines 
income from operations 
income from operations for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in income from operations is due primarily to the impacts of improved gross profit  partially offset by increased marketing and administrative expenses and research and development spending 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million  a million reduction from the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to lower borrowing levels and lower costs of borrowing 
partially offsetting the decrease is an increase of in amortization of debt issuance costs 
early repayments on our bank borrowings resulted in million of the increase  with the remainder being primarily attributable to amortization of debt costs paid in the fourth quarter of loss on redemption purchase of senior subordinated notes 
during the year ended december   we incurred losses of million on the early redemption and purchases of our senior subordinated notes 
these losses represent the difference between the carrying value of the notes and either the redemption price par plus of the face value for notes purchased with stock option or employee stock purchase plan proceeds  or the market price for open market purchases 
see liquidity and capital resources section below for further discussion 
income taxes 
income tax expense of million  representing an effective rate of  was recorded in the year ended december   as compared to million  representing an effective tax rate of  in the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the changes in certain valuation allowances and the mix in income by jurisdiction 
net income 
the net income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the prior year  an increase of million  or 
the increase in net income is primarily attributable to higher income from operations and lower interest expense  partially offset by higher income tax expense 
successor company year ended december  compared to period ended december  the following discussion compares the operating results of the successor company for the year ended december  to the period from october  to december  throughout this discussion  all references to the period ended december  represent the period from october  to december  this discussion covers two periods of different lengths 
net sales 
net sales of the successor company for the year ended december  and the period ended december  totaled  million and million  respectively 
sales for each segment were as follows in millions year ended of period ended of december  total december  total gcm americas gcm international global operations total the increase in sales of  million was driven primarily by the difference in the length of the periods twelve months of sales in versus approximately three months of sales in 
sales for the year ended december  by product line and as a percentage of total sales were as follows core chemistry products million  hemostasis products million  microbiology products million  infectious disease diagnostics products million  and mature products other million 
sales for the period ended december  by product line and as a percentage of total sales were as follows core chemistry products million  hemostasis products million  microbiology products million  infectious disease diagnostics products million  and mature products other million 
sales of gcm international represented a higher percentage of our total sales for as compared to primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
gross profit 
gross profit margins for the year ended december   were as compared to for the period ended december  approximately million of inventory step up under fresh start reporting  which was recognized as expense in the period ended december   negatively impacted margins for that period by 
the remaining improvement in margins was primarily due to favorable product mix  cost reduction initiatives at our manufacturing sites and favorable impacts from foreign currency exchange rate changes 
operating costs and expenses 
marketing and administrative expenses for the year ended december   totaled million or of sales as compared to million or of sales for the period ended december  non cash charges of million and million  respectively  for stock based compensation expense relating to stock options issued and stock grants made to management negatively impacted marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by and for the year ended december  and the period ended december   respectively 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million or of sales as compared to million or of sales for the period ended december  income loss from operations 
income from operations for the year ended december  was million compared to a loss from operations of million for the period ended december  the increase in operating income is attributable primarily to the different lengths of the periods and the absence of fresh start reporting adjustments in interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the period ended december  the increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to the different lengths of the periods 
income tax expense 
income tax expense of million  representing an effective rate of  was recorded in the year ended december   as compared to an income tax benefit of million  which represents an effective rate of  in the period ended december  the recording of valuation allowances  the accrual for unremitted earnings  and income from non us sources negatively impacted the effective rate in the period ended december  net income 
net income was million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the period ended december  the increase in net income is primarily due to increased sales as a result of different period lengths  increased gross profit margin percentage  the absence of fresh start reporting adjustments in  and decreased marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
successor company year ended december  compared to combined year ended december  the combining of successor and predecessor periods does not result in a presentation that is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  we believe such results will provide meaningful comparisons for the items listed below  which are generally unaffected by changes to our capital structure and the adoption of fresh start reporting 
in order to compare these line items for the years ended december  and  for purposes of the following discussion  the operating results of the successor company for the period ended december  which represents the period from october  through december  have been combined with the operating results of the predecessor company for the period ended october  which represents the period from january  through october   and are compared to the year ended december  fresh start reporting primarily affected depreciation  amortization and interest expense 
depreciation and amortization expense generally increased as a result of the revaluation of fixed assets and the recognition of new intangible assets 
interest expense generally decreased due to the reduction in the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness 
year ended december  combined in millions net sales gross profit marketing and administrative expenses research and development expenses net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  totaled  million as compared to  million in the corresponding prior year period 
sales for each segment were as follows in millions year ended december  combined change gcm americas gcm international global operations total adjusting for the favorable impact of foreign currency rate changes of million  sales increased million or for the year 
on a constant currency basis  sales increased million or in gcm americas  and million or across gcm international locations 
the increase on a constant currency basis can be primarily attributed to a million or increase in core chemistry sales primarily driven by dimension product sales globally  a million or increase in hemostasis product sales with the strongest growth in gcm americas  a million or increase in microbiology product sales  partially offset by a million or decrease in infectious disease product sales and million or decrease in sales of mature other products across all segments 
our worldwide installed base of instruments  an important indicator of future growth potential  grew during the year ended december  to provide more visibility to the growth dynamics of our instrument base  we adjusted our december  installed base statistic to remove mature product line instruments  including aca and opus  which are being phased out of our product portfolio over the next two years  and other older non strategic instruments 
the revised installed base of instruments as of december   using the new calculation methodology  was approximately growth in the installed base of dimension rxl and dimension xpand instruments as well as the bn prospec plasma protein instrument have driven much of the sales growth seen in our core chemistry products 
gains in the hemostasis installed base have been driven by successes in ca  ca  bcs and pfa instrument placements 
for microbiology  new installations of our autoscan and walkaway series of instruments continue to provide growth while the bep iii and bep instruments have been the primary contributors of installed base growth for the infectious disease product line 
however  migration in the hospital laboratory from microtiter plate testing to immunoassay instruments has caused an overall decline in idd sales 
improved method penetration  which results from utilizing an existing instrument base for additional tests  combined with the growth in sales of higher priced specialty tests  have further contributed to our sales growth 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased million to million  or of sales  as compared to million  or of sales  in the corresponding prior year period 
gross profit in was negatively impacted by a million inventory step up under fresh start reporting and approximately million related to the write off of excess inventory and reductions in production volumes during the bankruptcy proceedings 
these items  on a constant currency basis  negatively impacted the gross profit margin for by 
excluding the inventory step up impact  foreign currency changes positively impacted margins by  while manufacturing efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives at our manufacturing sites  and changes in product mix had a positive impact of 
partially offsetting these items  higher depreciation and amortization charges related to the implementation of fresh start reporting negatively impacted margins by 
marketing and administrative expenses 
marketing and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million to million  or of sales  as compared to million  or of sales  in the corresponding prior year period 
marketing and administrative expenses increased million related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  million related to higher non cash stock based compensation charges million in compared to million in  and approximately million related to incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the adoption of fresh start reporting 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  totaled million of sales and was higher than the corresponding prior year period 
on a constant currency basis  research and development expense increased million or over the corresponding prior year period 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net income was offset by changes in working capital 
in certain countries where the collection process is lengthy  we utilize factoring facilities under which certain trade accounts receivables are sold on a non recourse basis to financial institutions at face value 
during the year ended december   changes in accounts receivable positively impacted cash flows by million 
however  as a result of less incremental accounts receivable factoring during  changes in accounts receivable negatively impacted cash flows by million for the year ended december  on a constant currency basis  our utilization of factoring facilities increased by million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   the outstanding balance on our factoring facilities was million 
changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities negatively impacted cash flows by million during as compared to positively impacting cash flows by million during this unfavorable change in cash flow from to is due to timing of cash disbursements 
when selling instruments to our customers  we may enter into sales type lease transactions 
during the year ended december   we sold approximately million of lease receivables to a financial institution  of which million were sold in the fourth quarter 
the sales during resulted in losses of million 
the losses are included in other expense on the accompanying statement of operations 
at december   lease receivables of million were included in other assets on the accompanying balance sheet 
we expect lease receivables and the amount of lease receivables we sell to be greater in than in we made pension plan funding payments in the us of million and million and outside the us of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we are currently estimating funding payments in the us and outside the us to be approximately million and million  respectively 
net cash flow used for investing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and was primarily for capital expenditures 
the increase in capital expenditures was due primarily to an increase in the placement of instruments at customers in exchange for contractual commitments for ongoing reagent revenues and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
we expect these trends to continue in financing activities for the year ended december  used net cash of million  versus million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used is primarily due to million of prepayments on borrowings in  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million and proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan of million 
we made early repayments of million on our bank debt during the year ended december  in january and february  we made additional prepayments totaling million 
we also redeemed or purchased million of our senior subordinated notes during the year ended december  of the million of notes that we redeemed or purchased  million of notes were redeemed pursuant to a program initiated in january  whereby net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan were used to redeem the notes 
the notes can be redeemed at par plus of the face value  plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date 
the remaining million of notes were purchased in the open market 
we do not expect to make any further early redemptions of our senior subordinated notes during  but we intend to refinance our notes in during the twelve months following october   we will have to pay an approximate premium to call these notes 
credit facilities 
as of december   the credit facility  as amended  consisted of a million term loan facility  an million term loan facility  and a million multi currency revolving credit facility 
the term loan facilities have a maturity date of october  at december   our borrowings under the term loan facility bore interest at an effective average rate of 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for a discussion about our interest rate hedging activity 
as of december   we had letters of credit outstanding of million  which reduced our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of december  as of december   certain of our subsidiaries in germany had a revolving credit facility for million which is renewable annually the dresdner facility 
borrowings under the dresdner facility are subject to a variable interest rate of the european overnight indexed average plus reduced to in january 
under the terms of the dresdner facility  up to million can be utilized in the forms of cash or guarantees  and the remainder can be used as credit lines for derivatives trading and settlement risks 
as of december   the interest rate was and million was outstanding 
an additional million was utilized for guarantee purposes  which reduced our available borrowing capacity under this facility 
in addition  a number of subsidiary companies outside the us have credit facilities available to meet their liquidity requirements 
as of december   the borrowing capacity under these facilities totaled million 
at december   million in borrowings and million of guarantees were outstanding under these credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements 
certain terms of the credit facility were amended in march the fourth amendment 
the fourth amendment immediately reduced the annual cost of borrowing under the dollar denominated term loans by basis points 
it also provided for higher interest rate margins if our credit ratings deteriorate 
the fourth amendment also allowed us to make up to million of open market purchases of our senior subordinated notes 
the amount of permitted additional indebtedness  as defined in the agreement  was also increased to million 
the credit facility was again amended in december the fifth amendment 
the fifth amendment reduced the interest rate applicable to the dollar denominated term loans by basis points from the then current rate 
the fifth amendment also increased the amount of non us accounts receivable which may be factored from million to million  increased the limitation on capital expenditures from million to million for the fiscal year ended december  and increased the limitation on capital expenditures to million for each subsequent fiscal year through in we made million of voluntary prepayments of required amortization payments originally due through march additional prepayments totaling million were made in january and february senior subordinated notes 
at december   we had senior subordinated notes due outstanding in the principal amount of million  with a coupon rate of 
the obligations under the senior subordinated notes are senior to all of dade behring inc s subordinated unsecured obligations and subordinate to the credit facility 
we redeemed million in principal amount of the notes during the year ended december  contractual cash obligations projected payments and estimated interest expense are as shown below expected payments by period in millions total after long term debt interest on long term debt revolving credit line fees on revolving credit line operating leases non us borrowing arrangements capital lease obligations purchase obligations pension plan contributions total contractual cash obligations as discussed above  we made prepayments on our term loans totaling million in january and february purchase obligations primarily consist of supply agreements with vendors for the purchase of specified levels of goods or services over the respective contract periods 
estimated pension plan contributions for are based on our funding policy as discussed below in critical accounting policies 
we have not determined projected pension contributions for years beyond off balance sheet arrangements except as noted in the table above  we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that  in management s view  are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and also require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe our most critical accounting policies note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  reserves for doubtful accounts  adjustments for write down of inventories to net realizable value  impairment of long lived assets  pension plan assumptions  and tax valuation allowances 
we use a combination of historical results and anticipated future events to estimate and make assumptions relating to our critical accounting policies 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
see also note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we manufacture and market a broad offering of clinical diagnostic products and services which include medical diagnostic instruments  reagents and consumables  and maintenance services 
revenue related to the sale of instruments  reagents and consumables represents the vast majority of our sales 
we recognize revenue from the sale of instruments  reagents and consumables upon delivery 
revenue for maintenance services is recognized as the services are provided 
instruments are sold outright to customers or via sales type lease arrangements 
instruments are also leased to customers pursuant to operating leases 
under operating lease arrangements  the cost of the instruments is carried on our balance sheet and amortized to cost of sales over the useful life of the equipment 
we provide most of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements  which contain multiple deliverable elements 
revenues under these bundled arrangements are allocated among the contract s constituent elements principally instruments  reagents  consumables and service based upon the estimated fair value of each element as determined by reference to verifiable objective evidence 
our principal point of reference in making this determination is the amount of revenue realized when products and services are sold separately in stand alone transactions 
reserves for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customers current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and payment accommodations made to our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
adjustments for write down of inventories to net realizable value 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost based on the first in  first out method or market 
market for raw materials is based on replacement costs and  for other inventory classifications  on net realizable value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for deterioration  excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next months 
several factors may influence the realizability of our inventories  including technological change and new product development 
these factors could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if we determine that our inventory was overvalued  we will be required to recognize such costs in cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for indicators of impairment 
management s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on operational performance and market conditions 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  including tradenames and trademarks  are tested for impairment annually 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  market values and projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are used to determine the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
pension plan assumptions 
we maintain non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees in the united states and a combination of contributory and non contributory plans in certain non us locations 
benefits under the united states plans are based on a cash balance formula 
our funding policy is to make contributions to the trusts of the plans that meet or exceed the minimum requirements of the employee retirement income security act of in an attempt to anticipate future events  several statistical and other factors are used in calculating the expense  liability and resulting funding requirements related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions we make about  among other things  the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases and withdrawal and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense we have recorded or may record  and our cash funding requirements 
in determining pension expense for  our assumption for the discount rate for the us plans was 
in determining the december  liabilities and pension expense for the us plans  the discount rate was assumed to be 
the discount rates for the non us plans ranged from to  and are expected to be between and for we generally determine the discount rate assumption by constructing a hypothetical portfolio of investments with maturities that mirror the pension obligation 
for the year ended december   our assumptions for the expected long term rates of return on pension plan assets were for the us plans and ranged from to for non us plans  respectively 
the rate for the non us plans is not expected to change for the rate for all non us plans is expected to be in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed at least annually  taking into account our asset allocation  historical returns on the types of assets in the trust and the current economic environment 
based on these factors  we expect the plan assets will earn an average of per year for the us plans and per year for the us plans over the long term 
these and other assumptions impacting pension expense could change in the future based on various factors  including  but not limited to  market conditions  asset allocations  and workforce composition 
for  our net periodic benefit costs for our us and us plans were approximately million and million  respectively 
these amounts are approximately the same as for the us plans and million higher than for the non us plans 
we expect that the costs will be approximately million and million higher than for the us plans and us plans  respectively 
however  changes in interest rates and market gains or losses could significantly impact post pension expense and additional funding requirements 
tax valuation allowances 
we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances if we believe more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset is not recoverable 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  we consider all currently available data  our historical us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and taxable earnings and losses by jurisdiction  current financial condition  forecast of future us gaap and taxable earnings and losses by jurisdiction and other relevant factors 
the data considered in determining the realizability of the us valuation allowance includes the tax deductions that we have received or will receive related to the stock options granted under the management stock option plan and the incentive compensation plan 
see note  shareholders equity and redeemable preferred stock  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
under the us internal revenue code of  as amended  a company is allowed a deduction on the date of exercise equal to the difference between the fair market value on date of exercise and the exercise price 
due to the significant increase in our share price since the issuance of certain stock options  we have a significant tax deduction that has caused uncertainty regarding the realizability of fully utilizing our section limitation related to our net operating loss carryforwards and is considered negative evidence in evaluating the need for the us valuation allowance 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in a jurisdiction  or if there is a material change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our remaining net deferred tax assets resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results 
see tax credits and loss carryforwards below and note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussions 
recent accounting developments in december  the fasb issued a revised sfas no 
 share based payment 
the revised sfas no 
replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the revised statement requires compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
generally  the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the instruments issued 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
we will adopt the revised sfas no 
on july  and the provisions will be applied prospectively 
in the first half of  we will recognize approximately million of expense under apb opinion no 
related to stock option grants made through december  after adoption of the revised sfas no 
 we estimate that we will recognize approximately million of expense during the second half of from stock option grants made through december  and our employee stock purchase plan 
additional expense may be recognized should future grants be made after january  in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  to clarify the accounting for abnormal inventory costs 
sfas no 
requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility costs  freight  handling costs and spoilage are to be recognized as current period expenses regardless of whether they meet the so abnormal criterion outlined in accounting research bulletin no 
in addition  the allocation of fixed production overhead costs to inventory is to be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
unallocated overhead costs are to be recognized as expenses in the period incurred 
normal capacity is defined as the production expected to be achieved over a number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances  taking into account the loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a revised sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the revised sfas no 
retains the disclosure requirements required by the original statement 
additional disclosures have been added which include information describing the types of plan assets  investment strategy  measurement dates  plan obligations  cash flows  and components of net periodic benefit cost recognized during interim periods 
except as noted below  sfas no 
was effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after december  disclosure of estimated future benefit payments and information about non us plans is effective for fiscal years ending after june  interim period disclosures are effective for interim periods beginning after december  the required and disclosure provisions have been adopted in the attached consolidated financial statements 
tax credits and loss carryforwards realization of cancellation of indebtedness income 
subject to certain exceptions  a debtor generally recognizes an amount of cancellation of debt cod income upon satisfaction of its outstanding indebtedness equal to the excess of the adjusted issue price of the indebtedness satisfied over the sum of the issue price of any new indebtedness issued  the amount of cash paid and the fair market value of any other consideration  including stock of the debtor  given in satisfaction of the indebtedness 
as discussed below  there is a bankruptcy exception to the recognition of cod income which applies to us in connection with the reorganization 
a debtor is not required to include cod income in gross income if the debt discharge occurs in a title case 
however  under the us internal revenue code of  as amended  the tax code the debtor must  as of the first day of the next taxable year  reduce its tax attributes in general  first its nol carryovers and then tax credits and capital loss carryovers and then the tax basis of its assets by the amount of cod income excluded from gross income by this exception 
as an exception to the order of tax attribute reduction described above  a taxpayer can elect to reduce its tax basis in its depreciable assets first  then its nol carryovers and then its tax credits and capital loss carryovers 
since the cod income was realized in a title case  we are not required to include the cod income in taxable income  but are required to reduce our us nol carryovers by the amount of the cod income 
our us nol carryover as of december  was million after the amount of cod income realized as a result of the reorganization 
section limitation on nol carryovers and other tax attributes 
as a result of the consummation of the reorganization  we underwent an ownership change within the meaning of section of the tax code 
as a consequence  after the reorganization  we are subject to limitation on the use of any us nol carryover incurred prior to the ownership change 
under special provisions of section of the tax code applicable to companies in bankruptcy  the limitation is equal to the product of the lesser of x the value of the equity of the reorganized debtors immediately after the ownership change and y the value of the consolidated gross assets immediately before such change  with certain adjustments and the long term tax exempt rate in effect for the month of the effective date of the reorganization as published in the internal revenue bulletin of the united states treasury department 
we elected not to apply the general us nol limitation applicable to companies in bankruptcy since application of that rule would result in less favorable treatment than that described above 
if a corporation that undergoes an ownership change has a net unrealized built in loss  subject to certain limitations  any recognized built in loss during the five year period beginning with the date of the ownership change  referred to as the recognition period  is generally treated as a pre change loss and is subject to the section limitation described above 
if the corporation has a net unrealized built in gain  subject to certain limitations  the section limitation for any taxable year within the recognition period will be increased by the recognized built in gain for such taxable year 
a net unrealized built in gain or net unrealized built in loss exists to the extent the fair market value of the corporation s assets is more or less  respectively  than the aggregate adjusted tax basis of its assets immediately before the ownership change  provided the resulting net unrealized built in gain or net unrealized built in loss is greater than the lesser of of the fair market value of the corporation s assets and million 
under current irs administrative policy  the amount of the cod income recognized upon an ownership change is treated as an item of income attributable to the pre change period under section h of the tax code and such cod income is added to the gross fair market value of the corporation s assets in determining whether the loss corporation has a net unrealized built in loss 
any unused section limitation in a given year may be carried forward  thereby increasing the section limitation in the subsequent taxable year 
however  if the corporation or consolidated group does not continue its historic business or use a significant portion of its assets in a new business for two years after the ownership change  the section limitation resulting from the ownership change will be zero 
alternative minimum tax 
a corporation must pay an alternative minimum tax  or amt  equal to of its alternative minimum taxable income  or amti  reduced by certain credits allowable for amt purposes  to the extent that the amt exceeds the tax of the corporation calculated at the normal progressive income tax rates 
in calculating the amti  a corporation s income and losses are subject to various adjustments 
for example  in computing amti  a corporation s nols are adjusted for the adjustments and preferences under the amt sections of the tax code and such resulting nols can be utilized to offset only of the corporation s amti for nols generated or taken as carryforwards in taxable years ending in or 
however  cod income that is excluded from taxable income under the rules discussed above under realization of cancellation of indebtedness income similarly is excluded from amti 
as a result of limitations on the use of our nols and the reduced annual amount of depreciation used in calculating amti  it is possible that we may be required to pay amt even though we may not otherwise be required to pay regular federal income tax 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating and financing activities  we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  we manage exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates primarily through the use of derivatives 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
the qualitative and quantitative information presented below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments outstanding at december  fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices 
the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes  and to our consolidated financial statements 
no material changes in our market risk have occurred since december  interest rate risk 
we use interest rate swap agreements to effectively limit exposure to interest rate movements within the parameters of our interest rate hedging policy 
these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 and as such  as long as the hedge is effective and the underlying transaction is probable  the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these contracts is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until earnings are affected by the cash flows being hedged 
the fair value of our interest rate derivative agreements is the estimated amount that we would pay or receive to terminate the agreements  assuming prevailing interest rates 
at december   million of our term debt was hedged using interest rate swap agreements  which resulted in an average effective borrowing rate of 
a sensitivity analysis to measure the potential impact that a change in interest rates would have on our net income indicates that a adverse change in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million based on december  debt positions 
the table below provides information as of december  about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including our interest rate swap agreements and long term debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for the interest rate swap agreements  the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
expected maturity date thereafter total fair value amounts in millions long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate swaps variable to fixed average pay rate average receive rate foreign currency risk 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to primarily hedge foreign currency transactional exposures 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregated notional amount of million 
at december   the fair value of outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts was a liability of million 
gains and losses on forward contracts resulting from revaluations are recorded to foreign exchange gain loss and substantially offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in current earnings 
to manage the foreign currency risk on our foreign currency sales outside of the united states  in  we purchased average rate put options for various currencies with characteristics similar to those of our underlying exposure to manage this foreign currency exposure 
the terminal value of the average rate put options is designated as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and as such  as long as the hedge is effective and the underlying transaction is probable  the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these contracts is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the cash flows being hedged 
at december   we held average rate put options with aggregated notional amounts of approximately million 
at december   the fair value of outstanding foreign currency option contracts aggregated a million asset 
we do not engage in trading or other speculative use of financial instruments 
derivative losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive losses are a result of qualifying hedging activity 
a sensitivity analysis to measure the potential impact that a change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on the company s net income indicates that a adverse change in currency exchange rates would lead to gains losses of approximately million on foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december  such gains losses would be substantially offset by losses gains from the revaluation or settlement of the underlying positions hedged
