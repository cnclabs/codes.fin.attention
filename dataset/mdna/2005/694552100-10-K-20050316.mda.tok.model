item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview background the following discussion presents information about our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
substantially all of our operations are conducted by the bank  and the bank accounts for substantially all of our consolidated revenues and operating costs 
the bank was incorporated in and began operations in the company was incorporated in january for the purpose of becoming a holding company for and acquiring all of the outstanding shares of the bank  which occurred in june prior to the acquisition of the bank  the company conducted no business operations and  as a result  for accounting purposes the company s inception and commencement of its operations are deemed to be the inception of the bank in and the commencement of its operations in  respectively 
forward looking statements 
this discussion contains statements regarding operating trends and our beliefs and expectations regarding our future financial performance and future financial condition which are referred to as forward looking statements 
the consequences of those operating trends on our business and the realization of our expected future financial results  which are discussed in those statements  are subject to the uncertainties and risks described below in this section of this report under the caption uncertainties and risks that could affect our future financial performance 
due to those uncertainties and risks  the duration and effects of those operating trends on our business and our future financial performance may differ  possibly significantly  from those that are currently expected as set forth in the forward looking statements 
as a result  you should not place undue reliance on those forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards in the united states gaap and general practices in the banking industry 
the accounting policies we follow in determining the sufficiency of our allowance for loan losses and the fair value of derivative financial instruments involve judgments and assumptions which can have a material impact on the carrying value of our loans and those financial instruments  respectively  and  as a result  we consider these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses 
the accounting policies and practices we follow in determining the sufficiency of the allowance we establish for possible loan losses require us to make judgments and assumptions about economic and market trends that can affect the ability of our borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations 
accordingly  we use historical loss factors  adjusted for current economic market conditions and other economic indicators  to determine the losses inherent in our loan portfolio and the sufficiency of our allowance for loan losses 
the actual loan losses could be greater than that predicted by those loss factors and our current assessments of current conditions and economic trends if unanticipated changes were to occur in those conditions 
in such an event  it would be necessary for us to increase the allowance for loan losses by means of a charge to income referred to in our financial statements as the provision for loan losses 
such an increase would reduce the carrying value of our loans on our balance sheet  and the additional provision for loan losses taken to increase that allowance would reduce our income  in the period when it is determined that an increase in the allowance for loan losses is necessary 
see provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans below 
derivative financial instruments 
the derivative financial instruments that we enter into consist primarily of interest rate lock commitments that are designed to hedge mortgage loans held for sale 
at december   approximately million of mortgage loans held for sale were hedged 
we estimate the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale based on period end market interest rates obtained from various mortgage investors 
the fluctuation in the fair values of the mortgage loans held for sale are 
table of contents reflected in our consolidated statements of financial condition and  correspondingly  as adjustments to our noninterest income 
we also enter into non designated derivative instruments relating to mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments with borrowers and investors in order to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates 
at december  we had million of mortgage loan commitments identified as non designated derivative instruments 
we did not have any significant ineffective hedges at december  overview of fiscal operating results the following table sets forth the interest income that we generated  the interest expense that we incurred and our net interest income  net income and net income per share in the years ended december   and year ended december  amount percent change amount percent change amount dollars in thousands except per share data interest income interest expense net interest income noninterest income noninterest expense net income net income per share diluted weighted average number of diluted shares the increase in net income in as compared to was primarily attributable to a combination of factors  the most important of which included improvement in net interest income and net interest margin 
an million  or increase in net interest income in fiscal  primarily as a result of a million  or  increase in the average volume of our outstanding loans inclusive of mortgages held for sale during fiscal over fiscal the increase in loan volume also was the principal contributor to an improvement in our interest margin to in fiscal from in fiscal management of noninterest expense growth and improvements in efficiency ratio 
even though the volume of interest earning assets and our net interest income increased by and  respectively  in  we were able to manage the growth of our noninterest expenses which  by comparison  increased by  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the combination of the increases in net interest income and the single digit slowing in the growth of our operating expenses  our efficiency ratio operating expenses as a percentage to total revenues improved to in fiscal from in fiscal this improvement was indicative of a maturing of  and increased business growth at our financial centers that has helped us to generate more revenue per employee in fiscal  than we did in fiscal the increase in net interest income and the slowing of the growth of our noninterest expense more than offset the effects of i a million  or decline in noninterest income to million in the year ended december   from million for the same period in  due primarily to a reduction in the volume of mortgage refinancings resulting from increases in mortgage interest rates that began in the second half of  and ii the effect on earnings per share of our completion in december of a public offering of  of our shares of common stock at a price of per share  which caused the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding to increase to million shares for the year ended december  from million shares for the year ended december  
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in net income in as compared to was primarily attributable to increase in net interest income 
an increase in net interest income of million  or  in fiscal  primarily as a result of increases in the volume of interest earning assets  that included a million  or  increase in our average volume of outstanding loans inclusive of mortgages held for sale  and an increase of million in the average volume of securities available for sale  during fiscal over fiscal increase in noninterest income 
an increase of million  or  in noninterest income  to million in fiscal from million in  primarily as a result of a substantial increase in mortgage loan originations 
improvement in efficiency ratio 
a slowing in the rate of growth of noninterest expense  which  contributed to an improvement in our efficiency ratio noninterest expense expressed as a percentage of the sum of net interest income and noninterest income to in fiscal from in fiscal set forth below are certain key financial performance ratios and other financial data for the periods indicated year ended december  return on average assets return on average shareholders equity ratio of average equity to average assets net interest margin results of operations net interest income one of the principal determinants of a bank s income is net interest income  which is the difference between i the interest that a bank earns on loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets  on the one hand  and ii its interest expense  which consists primarily of the interest it must pay to attract and retain deposits and the interest that it pays on borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities  on the other hand 
a bank s interest income and interest expense are  in turn  affected by a number of factors  some of which are outside of its control  including national and local economic conditions and the monetary policies of the federal reserve board which affect interest rates  the demand for loans  and the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations 
net interest income  when expressed as a percentage of total average interest earning assets  is a banking organization s net interest margin 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  net interest income increased by million  or  to million  from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a million  or  increase in interest income that more than offset a million  or increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase of million  or  in the average volume of our outstanding loans inclusive of mortgage loans held for sale during fiscal over fiscal we funded that increase in loan volume by increasing our deposit volume and by using funds that had been invested in lower yielding short term investments and securities available for sale to fund higher yielding loans 
as a result  average outstanding loans represented of average earning assets in as compared to in and the yield on interest earning assets increased to from in the increase in interest expense in over was due primarily to an million increase in the average volume of other borrowings  including million principal amount of junior subordinated debentures that we sold during the fourth quarter of  which was partially offset by a basis point decline in rates paid on certificates of deposit at the bank during our net interest margin for fiscal improved to from in fiscal that improvement was primarily attributable to the increase in interest income and  to a lesser extent  to a decline in the average rate of interest paid on our interest bearing liabilities to from  in fiscal 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  net interest income increased by million  or  to million  from million in fiscal of  primarily as a result of a million  or  increase in interest income that more than offset a million  or increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of interest earning assets during  including a million increase in the average volume of outstanding loans including mortgages held for sale and a million increase in the average volume of securities available for sale during fiscal over the corresponding fiscal those volume related increases in interest earning assets  which enabled us to offset to a significant extent the impact of declining interest rates on our interest income  were funded primarily by the increase in deposits and in borrowings we obtained from the federal home loan bank and a shift of funds out of lower yielding federal funds sold during fiscal the increase in interest expense in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to a million increase in the average volume of interest bearing deposits  a million increase in the average volume of federal home loan bank borrowings  and interest paid on the million of junior subordinated debentures issued during the second half of  which more than offset the effect on interest expense of declining market rates of interest in our net interest margin for fiscal declined to from in fiscal this decline was due to further decreases in market rates of interest  primarily as a result of the reductions in the prime lending rates during and  and an acceleration in fiscal of premium amortization on mortgage backed securities in our investment portfolio  which resulted in a million rate related decrease in interest earned on securities available for sale during the year

table of contents provision for loan losses like virtually all banks and other financial institutions  we follow the practice of maintaining a reserve or allowance the allowance for possible loan losses that occur from time to time as an incidental part of the banking business 
when it is determined that the payment in full of a loan has become unlikely  the carrying value of the loan is reduced to what management believes is its realizable value 
this reduction  which is referred to as a loan charge off  or write down is charged against that allowance 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses is increased periodically i to replenish the allowance after it has been reduced due to loan charge offs  ii to reflect changes in the volume of outstanding loans  and iii to take account of changes in the risk of potential losses due to a deterioration in the condition of borrowers or in the value of property securing non performing loans or changes in economic conditions 
see financial condition allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans below in this section of this report 
increases in the allowance for loan losses are made through a charge  recorded as an expense in the statement of income referred to as the provision for loan losses 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are added back to the allowance and  therefore  have the effect of increasing the allowance for loan losses and reducing the amount of the provision that might otherwise be made to replenish or increase the allowance 
although we employ economic models that are based on bank regulatory guidelines  industry standards and historical loss experience to evaluate and determine the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses and  thereby  the amount of the provisions required to be made for potential loan losses  those determinations involve judgments about trends in current economic conditions and other events that can affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations 
the duration and effects of economic trends subject to a number of uncertainties and changes that are outside of our ability to control 
see the discussion below in this section under the caption risks and uncertainties that could affect our future financial performance we could incur losses on the loans we make 
in the event of unexpected subsequent events or changes in circumstances  it could become necessary in the future to incur additional charges to increase the allowance  which would have the effect of reducing our income or could cause us to incur losses 
in addition  the federal reserve board and the california department of financial institutions  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require the bank to make additional provisions  over and above that which we have already made  the effect of which would be to reduce our income 
the following table sets forth the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december  and year ended december  dollars in thousands total gross loans outstanding at end of period average total loans outstanding for the period allowance for loan losses at beginning of period loans charged off recoveries provision for loan losses charges to operating expense allowance for loan losses at end of period allowance for loan losses as a percentage of average total loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total outstanding loans at end of period net charge offs as a percentage of average total loans net charge offs as a percentage of total loans outstanding at end of period net loans charged off to allowance for loan losses net loans charged off to provision for loan losses includes net deferred loan costs and excludes loans held for sale 

table of contents during fiscal we were able to reduce the provisions we made for loan losses to  down from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a reduction in the volume of non accrual or impaired loans in nonaccrual and impaired loans totaled  or of the allowance for loan losses at december   as compared to million or of the allowance for loan losses at december  the reduction in nonaccrual loans during the year ended december  was due to i an  charge off  in the first quarter of  of a nonaccrual loan for which reserves had been specifically allocated in the allowance for loan losses at december   and ii the repayment of or resumption of payments on substantially all of the other loans that were on nonaccrual status at december  see allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans below 
noninterest income noninterest income consists primarily of mortgage banking income which includes loan origination and processing fees and service released premiums and net gains on sales of loans held for sale  which are generated by our mortgage loan division 
that division  which we established during fiscal  originates conforming and non conforming  agency quality  residential first and second lien and home equity mortgage loans 
the volume of residential mortgage refinancings is subject to significant fluctuations in response to changes in prevailing mortgage interest rates 
such interest rate changes can impact the volume of mortgage loan originations which  in turn  affects the loan processing fees and yield spread premiums we are able to realize on the mortgage loans we originate 
for example  the decline in mortgage rates which occurred in and the first six months of increased demand for mortgage loan refinancings and resulted in increases in our noninterest income during those periods 
conversely  an increasing interest rate environment  which has occurred during fiscal  generally causes a decline in mortgage loan refinancings and  therefore  corresponding declines in the volume of mortgage loan originations and in the income that the mortgage banking division is able to generate 
we seek to manage the impact of changes in interest rates by seeking to originate mortgages for home purchases which are not as interest rate sensitive as mortgage loan refinancings 
mortgage loans for home purchases accounted for approximately of our mortgage loan fundings in the year ended december  as compared to approximately in the year ended december  the following table identifies the components of and the percentage changes in noninterest income in the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively year ended december  amount percent change amount percent change amount percent change dollars in thousands mortgage banking including net gains on sales of loans held for sale service charges and fees on deposits net gains on sales of securities available for sale n m net gains on sales of loans n m n m n m net gains on sale of other real estate owned n m n m n m ach fee income n m other total noninterest income the decrease in noninterest income in was primarily attributable to million  or decrease in mortgage loan refinancings prompted by rising interest rates 
the effect of that decrease on noninterest in was partially offset by a  increase in net gains on securities available for sale and net gains on sales of other real estate owned of the million  or  increase in noninterest income in over was primarily attributable to i substantial increases in mortgage loan refinancings prompted by declining market rates of interest  ii net gains of  in from sales of million principal amount of securities available for sale made to reposition our securities portfolio in response to changes in market interest rates  and iii an increase in service charges and fees  primarily on deposit transactions  which was attributable to the growth in the volume of our deposits in 
table of contents noninterest expense the following table sets forth the principal components of noninterest expense and the amounts thereof  incurred in the years ended december   and  respectively 
year ended december  amount percent change amount percent change amount dollars in thousands salaries and employee benefits occupancy equipment and depreciation data processing professional fees other loan related customer expense stationery and supplies other operating expense total noninterest expense other operating expense primarily consists of telephone  advertising  promotional  business development  regulatory expenses  investor relations  insurance premiums  and correspondent bank fees 
as indicated above  total noninterest expense for the year ended december  increased by  or  as compared to the corresponding period in that increase was primarily attributable to an increase in expenses associated with the opening  in september  of our seventh financial center  which is located in long beach  california  and increased commercial lending activities in our financial centers  partially offset by staff reductions and other cost cutting measures implemented by the mortgage loan division in response to lower mortgage refinancing production volumes 
the increase in noninterest expense in  over was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and employee expenses that were due primarily to the expansion of the financial centers that we established in and an expansion of our mortgage lending division to take advantage of increased mortgage refinancing demand in one measure of our ability to control noninterest expense is our efficiency ratio  which is the ratio of noninterest expenses to net revenue net interest income plus noninterest income 
the efficiency ratio indicates the percentage of net revenue that must be used to cover noninterest expenses 
as a general rule  all other things being equal  a lower efficiency ratio will result in increased profitability 
our efficiency ratio improved to in from in in  our efficiency ratio was  as compared to for these decreases indicate that we have been able  in each of the past two years  to increase net revenue without a commensurate increase in our noninterest expense 
additionally  we believe that the achievement of increased efficiencies in our operations was a significant contributor to the increase in our profitability in financial condition assets our total consolidated assets increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december   primarily as a result of an increase in the volume of our outstanding loans that was due to the expansion and maturing of our banking franchise during the past two years  marketing programs implemented in  and improvements in economic conditions that led to increases in loan demand 
this increase in outstanding loans was funded primarily by increases in borrowings and  to a lesser extent  increases in deposits and a shift of funds out of other lower yielding interest earning assets

our investment policy is designed to provide for our liquidity needs and to generate a favorable return on investments without undue interest rate risk  credit risk or asset concentrations 
that investment policy authorizes us to invest in obligations issued or fully guaranteed by the united states government  certain federal agency obligations  time deposits issued by federally insured depository institutions  municipal securities and in federal funds sold  provides that the aggregate weighted life of our portfolio of us treasury obligations and federal agency securities  including mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by the us treasury and federal agencies  but excluding variable rate securities  is not to exceed fifteen years while the weighted average life of our portfolio of municipal securities is not to exceed twelve years  provides that funds placed in time deposits may not be held at federally insured financial institutions in amounts exceeding  per institution and those deposits may not have maturities exceeding months  and prohibits engaging in securities trading activities 
securities available for sale 
securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time  but which may be sold in response to changes in liquidity needs  changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risks or other similar factors are classified as securities available for sale 
such securities are recorded on our balance sheet at their respective fair values and increases or decreases in those values are recorded as unrealized gains or losses  respectively  and are reported as other comprehensive income loss rather than included in or deducted from our earnings 
the following is a summary of the major components of securities available for sale and a comparison of the amortized cost  estimated fair values and the gross unrealized gains and losses attributable to those securities  as of december  and december  amortized cost gross unrealized gain gross unrealized loss estimated fair value dollars in thousands december  securities available for sale mortgage backed securities collateralized mortgage obligations total government and agencies securities mutual fund total securities available for sale december  securities available for sale mortgage backed securities collateralized mortgage obligations total government and agencies securities fannie mae trust preferred stock total securities available for sale

the amortized cost and estimated fair value  at december   of securities available for sale are shown in the table below by contractual maturities and historical prepayments based on the prior twelve months of principal payments 
expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities and historical prepayments  particularly with respect to collateralized mortgage obligations  because changes in interest rates will affect the timing and the extent of prepayments by borrowers

all million of loans held for sale were designated as fair value hedges at december   and there were no ineffective hedges 
we use hedge accounting to offset the decrease or increase in fair value of the loans held for sale with the decrease or increase in value of interest rate lock commitments 
volatility of reported earnings is therefore minimized 
net unrealized losses or gains on loans held for sale  if any  are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges to noninterest income 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of approximately  representing net unrealized gains related to these loans held for sale and unfunded commitments to make such loans

real estate and residential mortgage loans are loans secured by trust deeds on real property  including commercial property and single family and multi family residences 
construction loans are interim loans to finance specific construction projects 
consumer loans include installment loans to consumers

the allowance for loan losses the allowance at december  was million  which represented about of the loans outstanding at december   as compared to million  or  of the loans outstanding at december   in each case exclusive of loans held for sale 
this reduction in the percentage of the allowance to loans outstanding at december  was the result of a loan charge off of  in the first quarter of  for which reserves had been included in the allowance at december  and the performance of the remainder of the loans in our loan portfolio as a result of which the amount of nonaccrual and impaired loans was  during the last three quarters of  relatively insignificant 

table of contents in determining the adequacy of the allowance  we follow bank regulatory guidelines and we carefully monitor changing economic conditions  the loan portfolio by category  the financial condition of borrowers and the historical performance of the loan portfolio 
we believe that at december  the allowance was adequate to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
however  as the volume of loans increases  additional provisions for loan losses will be required to maintain the allowance at adequate levels 
additionally  the allowance was established on the basis of estimates and judgments we make regarding such matters as economic conditions and trends and the financial condition of borrowers  historical industry loan loss data and regulatory guidelines 
actual loan losses in the future could vary from the losses predicted on the basis of those estimates  judgments and guidelines 
for example  if economic conditions were to deteriorate  or interest rates were to increase  which would have the effect of increasing the risk that borrowers would encounter difficulties meeting their loan payment obligations  it could become necessary to increase the allowance by making additional provisions for loan losses 
see results of operations provision for loan losses above 
the following table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance to specific loan categories at the dates indicated below 
the allocations presented should not be interpreted as an indication that loans charged to the allowance will occur in these amounts or proportions  or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each loan category represents the total amount available for future losses that may occur within these categories as the total allowance is applicable to the entire loan portfolio 
december  allowance for loan losses of allowance to category of loans allowance for loan losses of allowance to category of loans dollars in thousands real estate loans commercial loans construction loans consumer loans total specific allocations are identified by loan category and allocated according to charge off data pertaining to the banking industry 
substantially all of the loans in the loan portfolio are graded and incorporated in the process of assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered sufficient to absorb estimated losses in the loan portfolio 
non performing loans 
we also measure and establish reserves for loan impairments on a loan by loan basis using either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
smaller  homogeneous loans such as consumer installment loans and lines of credit are excluded from our impairment calculations 
also  loans that experience insignificant payment delays or shortfalls are generally not considered to be impaired 
we cease accruing interest on  and classify as a nonaccrual loan  any loan as to which principal or interest has been in default for a period of days or more  or if payment in full of interest or principal is not expected 
at december   we had a  loan that was delinquent days or more and which was classified as a nonaccrual and impaired loan 
at december  there were million of loans that were delinquent days or more and which were classified as nonaccrual and impaired loans  of which  was charged off during we had no loans delinquent days or more with principal still accruing interest or any restructured loans either at december  or at december   our average investment in impaired loans  on a year to date basis  was  the interest that we would have earned in had the impaired loans remained current in accordance with their original terms was  by comparison  at december   our average investment in impaired loans on a year to date basis was  and the interest that we would have earned in had the impaired loans remained current in accordance with their original terms was

we project the future sources and uses of funds and maintain sufficient liquid funds for unanticipated events 
our primary sources of cash include payments on loans  the sale or maturity of investments and growth in deposits 
the primary uses of cash include funding new loans including mortgage loans held for sale and making advances on existing lines of credit  purchasing investments  including securities available for sale  funding deposit withdrawals and paying operating expenses 
we also maintain funds in overnight federal funds and other short term investments to provide for short term liquidity needs 
in addition  we have obtained credit lines from the federal home loan bank and other financial institutions to meet any additional liquidity requirements  that might arise 
cash flow provided by financing activities 
cash flow of million was provided by financing activities during the year ended december   the source of which consisted primarily of net increases of million in deposits  million in net borrowings from the federal home bank  and million from the sale of junior subordinated debentures in october 
table of contents cash flow used in operating activities 
cash flow of million was used by our operating activities  primarily from net income and million from origination of loans held for sale  offset by the proceeds for sales of loans held for sale and net income of million in the year ended december cash flow used in investing 
cash flow used in investing activities was million  primarily to fund an increase of million in loans and million of purchases of investment securities available for sale  partially offset by million of proceeds from sales of and principal payments received on investment securities available for sale in the year ended december  our liquid assets  which included cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  interest earning deposits with financial institutions and unpledged securities available for sale excluding federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock totaled million or of total assets at december  the relationship between gross loans and total deposits provides a useful measure of our liquidity 
since repayment of loans tends to be less predictable than the maturity of investments and other liquid resources  the higher the loan to deposit ratio the less liquid are our assets 
on the other hand  since we realize greater yields and higher interest income on loans than we do on investments  a lower loan to deposit ratio can adversely affect interest income and earnings 
as a result  our goal is to achieve a loan to deposit ratio that appropriately balances the requirements of liquidity and the need to generate a fair return on assets 
at december   the ratio of loans to deposits excluding loans held for sale was  compared to at december  contractual obligations borrowings 
as of december   we had million of outstanding long term borrowings and million of outstanding short term borrowings that we had obtained from the federal home loan bank

pursuant to those rulings  in  we formed subsidiary grantor trusts to sell and issue to institutional investors a total of million principal amount of floating junior trust preferred securities trust preferred securities 
we received the net proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities in exchange for our issuance to the grantor trusts  of a total million principal amount of our junior subordinated floating rate debentures the debentures  the payment terms of which mirror those of the trust preferred securities 
in october  we established another grantor trust that sold an additional million of trust preferred securities to an institutional investor and  in connection therewith  we sold and issued an additional million principal amount junior subordinated floating rate debentures in exchange for the proceeds raised from the sale of those trust preferred securities 
the payments that we make of interest and principal on the debentures are used by the grantor trusts to make the payments that come due to the holders of the trust preferred securities pursuant to the terms of those securities 
as required by fin which is described in note significant accounting policies recent accounting pronouncements  included as part of our consolidated financial statements that are set forth in item of this report  we deconsolidated the trusts as of march  such deconsolidation had no material impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
set forth below is certain information regarding the terms of the debentures that were outstanding as of december  original issue dates principal amount interest rate maturity date in thousands june  libor plus june august  libor plus august september  libor plus september october  libor plus october total interest rate resets quarterly 
interest rate resets semi annually 
these debentures have quarterly or semi annual interest payments  which may be deferred until the first redeemable date  and are redeemable at our option beginning years after their respective original issue dates 

table of contents under the federal reserve board rulings  the borrowings evidenced by the debentures  which are subordinated to all of our other borrowings that are outstanding or which we may obtain in the future  are eligible subject to certain dollar limitations to qualify and  at december   million of those debentures qualified as tier i capital  for regulatory purposes 
the remaining million qualified as tier ii capital for regulatory purposes 
see discussion below under the subcaption regulatory capital requirements 
other contractual obligations 
set forth below is information regarding our material contractual obligations as of december  operating lease obligations 
we lease certain facilities and equipment under various non cancelable operating leases 
future minimum non cancelable lease commitments were as follows at december  at december  in thousands thereafter total maturing time certificates of deposits 
set forth below is a maturity schedule  as of december   of time certificates of deposit of  or more at december  in thousands thereafter total off balance sheet arrangements loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
in order to meet the financing needs of our customers in the normal course of business  we make commitments to extend credit and issue standby commercial letters of credit to or for them 
at december  and  our outstanding loan commitments inclusive of mortgages held for sale totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and the customer may be required to pay a fee and meet other conditions in order to draw on those commitments or standby letters of credit 
we expect  based on historical experience  that many of the commitments will expire without being drawn upon and  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
to varying degrees  commitments to extend credit involve elements of credit and interest rate risk for us that are in excess of the amounts recognized in our balance sheets 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customers to whom such commitments are made is equal to the amount of those commitments that are ultimately funded prior to their expiration 
as a result  before making a loan commitment to a customer  we evaluate the customer s creditworthiness using the same underwriting standards that we would apply if we were deciding whether or not to approve loans to the customer 
in addition  we often require the customer to secure its payment obligations for amounts drawn on such commitments with collateral such as accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing commercial properties  residential properties and properties under construction 

table of contents standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent resources  together with available borrowings under our credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable us to meet any increases in demand for loans and leases or in the utilization of outstanding loan commitments or standby letters of credit and any increase in deposit withdrawals that might occur in the foreseeable future 
capital resources the company on a consolidated basis and the bank on a stand alone basis are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can lead to the imposition of certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary restrictions on the operations of the company and the bank by their respective bank regulatory agencies that  if imposed  could have a direct material adverse impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
see business supervision and regulation capital standards and prompt corrective action in part i of this report 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action that apply to all bank holding companies and fdic insured banks in the united states  the company on a consolidated basis and the bank on a stand alone basis must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital requirements that the company may be required to meet also are subject to qualitative judgments by the bank regulators as to measures relating to those measures that bear on the financial condition of the company 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the company on a consolidated basis and the bank on a stand alone basis to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital generally  the ratio of the sum of common stock  non redeemable preferred stock and retained earnings to risk weighted assets and of tier i capital to average total assets 
the following table sets forth the amounts of capital and capital ratios of the company on a consolidated basis and the bank on stand alone basis at december   as compared to the respective minimum regulatory requirements applicable to them 
see business supervision and regulation capital standards and prompt corrective action in this report 
applicable federal regulatory requirement amount ratio capital adequacy purposes amount ratio dollars in thousands total capital to risk weighted assets company bank tier capital to risk weighted assets company bank tier capital to average assets company bank as of december   based on applicable capital regulations  the company on a consolidated basis and the bank on a stand alone basis qualified as well capitalized institutions under the capital adequacy guidelines described above 
our consolidated total capital and tier capital of the company  at december   include approximately million of long term indebtedness evidenced by the junior subordinated debentures that we issued in and in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities 
the remaining million was classified as tier ii capital 
see financial condition contractual obligations above 
we contributed million of the net proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities to the bank  thereby  increasing its total capital and tier capital 

table of contents under the federal reserve board s regulations that were in effect at the time we issued the junior subordinated debentures  substantially all of the indebtedness evidenced by those debentures qualified as tier capital for regulatory capital purposes  because they satisfied certain requirements established by the federal reserve board with respect to issuances of such debentures 
one of those requirements was that junior subordinated debentures had to be issued to a trust that was treated  for financial reporting purposes  as a consolidated subsidiary of the bank holding company that was the issuer of the debentures 
as a result  the adoption of fin no 
 which required bank holding companies to deconsolidate such trusts  created uncertainty for us  as well as other bank holding companies that had issued similar debentures  as to whether they would continue to qualify as tier capital for regulatory purposes 
for a description of fin no 
 see note significant accounting policies recent accounting pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
however  on february   the federal reserve board issued a new rule which provides that  notwithstanding the deconsolidation of such trusts that is required by fin no 
 junior subordinated debentures  such as those issued by us  may continue to constitute up to of a bank holding company s tier capital  subject to certain new quantitative limitations which will not become effective until march  and which  in any event  are not expected to materially affect the treatment of our junior subordinated debentures as tier capital for regulatory purposes 
public offering of common stock in december in december we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price per share 
the net proceeds of that public offering  which totaled approximately million  increased our total capital to support our future growth  and we used a portion of those net proceeds to fund the opening and cost of initial operation of our new long beach financial center and some of the loan growth achieved during the the remaining net proceeds of the stock offering will be used to fund the opening of our new ontario  california financial center and one additional full service financial center that we plan to establish in southern california over the next months 
risks and uncertainties that could affect our future financial performance this report  including the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth above  contains certain forward looking statements 
forward looking statements set forth estimates of  or our expectations or beliefs regarding  our future financial performance 
those estimates  expectations and beliefs are based on current information and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual operating results and financial performance in the future to differ  possibly significantly  from set forth in the forward looking statements contained in this report and  for that reason  you should not place undue reliance on those forward looking statements 
those risks and uncertainties include  although they are not limited to  the following we face intense competition from other banks and financial institutions that could hurt our business we conduct our business operations in southern california  where the banking business is highly competitive and is dominated by a relatively small number of large multi state banks with operations and offices covering wide geographical areas 
we also compete with other financial service businesses  mutual fund companies  and securities brokerage and investment banking firms that offer competitive banking and financial products and services 
the larger banks  and some of those other financial institutions  have greater resources that enable them to conduct extensive advertising campaigns and to shift resources to regions or activities of greater potential profitability 
some of these banks and institutions also have substantially more capital and higher lending limits that could enable them to attract larger clients  and offer financial products and services that we are unable to offer  particularly with respect to attracting loans and deposits 
increased competition may prevent us i from achieving increases  or could even result in decreases  in our loan volume or deposit balances  or ii from increasing interest rates on loans or reducing interest rates we pay to attract or retain deposits  any of which could cause a decline in our interest income or an increase in our interest expense  that could lead to reductions in our net interest income and earnings 
adverse changes in economic conditions in southern california could disproportionately harm our business the large majority of our customers and the properties securing a large proportion of our loans are located in southern california 
a worsening of economic conditions or the occurrence of natural disasters in southern california could harm our business by reducing loan demand which  in turn  would lead to reduced net interest margins and net interest income  affecting the financial capability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations  which could result in increases in loan losses and require us to make additional provisions for possible loan losses  thereby reducing our earnings  and 
table of contents leading to reductions in real property values that  due to our reliance on real property to secure many of our loans  could make it more difficult for us to prevent losses from being incurred on non performing loans through the sale of such real properties 
additionally  real estate values in california have been increasing rapidly in recent years 
in the event that these values are not sustained or other events  such as earthquakes or fires  that may be more prevalent in southern california than in other geographic areas  cause a decline in real estate values  our collateral coverage for our loans will be reduced and we may suffer increased loan losses 
national economic conditions and changes in federal reserve board monetary policies could affect our operating results our ability to achieve and sustain our profitability is substantially dependent on our net interest income 
like most banking organizations and other depository institutions  our net interest income is affected by a number of factors outside of our control  including changes in market rates of interest which  in turn  are affected by changes in national economic conditions and national monetary policies adopted by the federal reserve board 
from and continuing until june   the federal reserve board followed a policy of reducing interest rates in an effort to stimulate the national economy 
those interest rate reductions  coupled with sluggishness in the economy  led to decreases in our net interest margin during and made it more difficult to increase earnings 
we cannot predict whether the improvement in the economy will continue or whether the federal reserve board s recent increases in interest rates  which have totaled basis points so far in the second half of  will succeed in lessening the downward pressure on net interest margins that was prevalent through most of the last three years 
on the other hand  the benefits of increased market rates of interest may be offset  partially or in whole  because those increases will increase the costs of attracting deposits and obtaining borrowings 
if we are unable to effectuate commensurate increases in the rates we are able to charge on existing or new loans due to competitive pressures or contractual restrictions on our ability to increase interest rates on existing loans  our net interest margin may suffer despite the increase in interest rates 
additionally  the recent increases in mortgage rates have led to a decline in mortgage loan originations and a reduction in our noninterest income during changes in economic conditions and increasing rates of interest also could cause prospective borrowers to fail to qualify for our loan products and reduce loan demand  thereby reducing our net interest margins 
in addition  if economic conditions were to worsen  that could adversely affect the financial capability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations  which could result in loan losses and require increases in the provisions we make for possible loan losses 
rapid growth could strain our resources and lead to operating problems or inefficiencies we have grown substantially in the past five years by opening new financial centers 
we intend over the next months to open additional financial centers  primarily in southern california  either by opening new offices or acquiring one or more community banks 
the opening of new offices or the acquisition of another bank will result in increased operating expenses until new banking offices or acquired banking operations attract sufficient business to cover operating expenses  which usually takes at least six to twelve months 
there is no assurance  however  as to how long it would take for new financial centers to begin generating positive cash flow and earnings 
also  we may not succeed in adequately managing our growth  which will make substantial demands on the time and attention of management and on our capital resources 
the failure to prepare appropriately and on a timely basis for growth could cause us to experience inefficiencies or failures in our service delivery systems  regulatory problems  and erosion in customer confidence  unexpected expenses or other problems 
additionally  acquisitions of banks are extremely time consuming and expensive  and  in the case of bank acquisitions  subject to regulatory control 
such acquisitions could prove to be costly and adversely affect our operating results due to the possible incurrence of undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired bank  the incurrence of unanticipated costs or delays or difficulties in integrating the acquired bank s operations  technologies and personnel into our existing operations  organization and culture  possible regulatory agency required divestitures of certain assets  and the issuance of equity securities to pay for acquisitions which may be dilutive to existing shareholders 

table of contents we could incur losses on the loans we make the failure or inability of borrowers to repay their loans is an inherent risk in the banking business 
we take a number of measures designed to reduce this risk  including the maintenance of stringent loan underwriting policies and the establishment of reserves for possible loan losses and the requirement that borrowers provide collateral that we could sell in the event they fail to pay their loans 
however  the ability of borrowers to repay their loans  the adequacy of our reserves and our ability to sell collateral for amounts sufficient to offset loan losses are affected by a number of factors outside of our control  such as changes in economic conditions  increases in market rates of interest and changes in the condition or value of the collateral securing our loans 
as a result  we could incur losses on the loans we make that will hurt our operating results and weaken our financial condition 
government regulations may impair our operations  restrict our growth or increase our operating costs we are subject to extensive supervision and regulation by federal and state bank regulatory agencies 
the primary objective of these agencies is to protect bank depositors and other customers and not shareholders  whose respective interests will often differ 
the regulatory agencies have the legal authority to impose restrictions which they believe are needed to protect depositors and customers of banking institutions  even if such restrictions would adversely affect the ability of the banking institution to expand its business  or result in increases in its costs of doing business or hinder its ability to compete with financial services companies that are not regulated or banks or financial service organizations that are less regulated 
additionally  due to the complex and technical nature of many of the government regulations to which banking organizations are subject  inadvertent violations of those regulations may occur 
in such an event  we would be required to correct or implement measures to prevent a recurrence of such violations 
if more serious violations were to occur  the regulatory agencies could limit our activities or growth  fine us or ultimately put us out of business 
our computer and network systems may be vulnerable to unforeseen problems and security risks the computer systems and network infrastructure that we use to provide automated and internet banking services could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  earthquakes and similar catastrophic events and from security breaches 
any of those occurrences could result in damage to or a failure of our computer systems that could cause an interruption in our banking services or and  therefore  harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
additionally  interruptions in service  and security breaches that could result in the theft of confidential customer information  could lead existing customers to terminate their banking relationships with us and could make it more difficult for us to attract new banking customers 
the loss of key personnel could hurt our financial performance our success depends to a great extent on the continued availability of our existing management  in particular on raymond e 
dellerba  our president and chief executive officer 
in addition to their skills and experience as bankers  our executive officers provide us with extensive community ties upon which our competitive strategy is partially based 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on these executives  other than mr 
dellerba 
as a result  the loss of the services of any of these officers could harm our ability to implement our business strategy or our future operating results 
evolving regulation of corporate governance may result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq stock market rules are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we already have invested significant resources  and expect in the future to invest additional resources  to comply with those laws  regulations and standards 
this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
also  if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards do not achieve the results or objectives intended by regulatory or governing bodies  our reputation may be harmed or we may be subject to litigation 

table of contents other risks other risks that could affect our future financial performance are described in the section entitled risk factors in the prospectus dated december   included in our s registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under the securities act of  as amended  and readers of this report are urged to review those risks as well 
due to these and other possible uncertainties and risks  you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
we also disclaim any obligation to update forward looking statements contained in this report or in the above referenced prospectus 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
our interest rate risk arises from the instruments  positions and transactions entered into for purposes other than trading 
they include loans  securities  deposit liabilities  and short term borrowings 
interest rate risk occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times as market interest rates change 
interest rate risk is managed within an overall asset liability framework for the company 
asset liability management the primary objective of asset liability management is to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  which can affect our net interest margins and  therefore  our net interest income and net earnings 
we seek to achieve this objective by matching interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  and maintaining the maturities and the repricing of these assets and liabilities at appropriate levels in light of the prevailing interest rate environment 
generally  all other things being equal  i when rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities  net interest income will be positively impacted during a rising interest rate environment and negatively impacted during a declining interest rate environment  and ii when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  net interest income generally will be positively impacted during a declining interest rate environment and negatively impacted during a rising interest rate environment 
the table below sets forth information concerning our rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december  the assets and liabilities are classified by the earlier of maturity or repricing dates in accordance with their contractual terms 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the following table  which are discussed below 
three months or less over three through twelve months over one year through five years over five years non interest bearing total dollars in thousands assets interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions investment in unconsolidated trust subsidiaries securities available for sale federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock federal funds sold loans  gross non interest earning assets  net total assets liabilities and shareholders equity noninterest bearing deposits interest bearing deposits borrowings junior subordinated debentures other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative of rate sensitive assets in maturity period rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities n a cumulative ratio n a at december   as the above table indicates  our rate sensitive balance sheet was shown to be in a negative twelve month gap position 
this implies that our net interest margin would decrease in the short term if interest rates rise and would increase in the short term if interest rates were to fall 

table of contents however  the extent to which our net interest margin will be impacted by changes in prevailing interests rates will depend on a number of factors  including how quickly rate sensitive assets and liabilities react to interest rate changes  the mix of our interest earning assets loans versus other interest earning assets  such as securities and the mix of our interest bearing deposits between for example  lower interest core deposits and higher cost time certificates of deposit and our other interest bearing liabilities 
it is not uncommon rates on certain assets or liabilities typically lag behind changes in market rates of interest 
additionally  prepayments of loans and securities available for sale  and early withdrawals of certificates of deposit  could cause the interest sensitivities to vary 
additionally  the rate sensitivity analysis set forth in the table above assumes that we would make no changes in the mix of our interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities in response to changes in the interest rate environment  which is not consistent with our practices 
as a result  the relationship or gap between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities  as shown in the above table  is only a general indicator of interest rate sensitivity and the effect of changing rates of interest on our net interest income is likely to be different from that would be predicted on the basis of the interest rate sensitivity analysis set forth in the above table 
derivative financial instruments in accordance with our risk management policy  we use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates 
generally  if interest rates increase  the value of our mortgage loan commitments to borrowers and mortgage loans held for sale are adversely impacted 
as a result  we attempt to economically hedge of the risk of the overall changes that may occur in the fair value of such mortgage loan commitments and mortgage loans held for sale by entering into interest rate lock commitments with investors in mortgage loans at the date loan commitments are made to the individual borrowers 
these rate lock commitments are entered into at the same terms as those extended to those borrowers to be delivered to the investors at a future date 
mortgage loan commitments to borrowers and interest rate lock commitments with investors in mortgage loans are classified as non designated as derivative instruments and are included in mortgage loans held for sale 
gains and losses resulting from these derivative instruments are included in gains on sales of loans in the company s consolidated statements of income operations 
we did not have any significant ineffective hedges as of december
