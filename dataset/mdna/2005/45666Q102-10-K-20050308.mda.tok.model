the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of enterprise data integration software 
we generate revenues from sales of software licenses and services  which consist of maintenance  consulting and education services 
our license revenues are derived from our data integration software products 
we receive software license revenues from licensing our products directly to end users and indirectly through resellers  distributors and oems 
we 
table of contents receive service revenues from maintenance contracts  consulting services and education services that we perform for customers that license our products either directly or indirectly 
we license our software and provide services to many industry sectors  including  but not limited to  financial services  communications  pharmaceuticals  insurance  manufacturing  utilities  government and retail 
we sell our products through both our own direct sales forces and indirect channel partners in the united states as well as belgium  canada  france  germany  the netherlands  switzerland  the united kingdom  asia pacific  australia  japan and latin america 
most of our international sales have been in europe 
revenue outside of europe and north america  which includes the united states and canada  have been or less of total consolidated revenues during the last three years  although we anticipate further expansion outside of these two regions in the future 
during  we released an updated version of powercenter  our core data integration product offering  and superglue  our integrated metadata solution 
in  total revenues grew to million as we generated our highest annual total revenues since the inception of the company 
the increase in service revenues  primarily from increased maintenance revenues driven by strong renewals from our expanding customer base  coupled with contribution from the new releases of existing products offset the loss of revenue from our analytical application suites and data warehouse modules  products that we ceased selling in we incurred a significant net loss in of million or net loss per share 
this was primarily due to restructuring charges of million in associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters in december critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item  which contains additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition we follow detailed revenue recognition guidelines  which are discussed below 
we recognize revenue in accordance with gaap guidance that has been prescribed for the software industry 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
consequently  the revenue recognition accounting rules require management to make significant judgments  such as determining if collectibility is probable and if a customer is credit worthy 
we recognize revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop software revenue recognition  as amended and modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
we recognize license revenues when a noncancelable license agreement has been signed  the product has been shipped or we have provided the customer with the access codes that allow for immediate possession of the software collectively delivered  the fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vsoe is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price  which does not 
table of contents change before the element is made generally available  is established by authorized management 
if an acceptance period is required  we recognize revenue upon customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period after all other revenue recognition criteria under sop have been met 
our standard agreements do not contain product return rights 
credit worthiness and collectibility are first assessed on a country level basis 
then  for those customers  including direct end users and our indirect channel partners resellers  distributors and original equipment manufacturers oems in countries deemed to have sufficient timely payment history  customers are assessed based on their payment history and credit profile 
the country level assessment of credit worthiness and collectibility has generally been performed annually with any changes in assessment effective on january st of the next fiscal year 
we recently performed a country level assessment of credit worthiness and determined additional countries to be credit worthy based on geopolitical and economic stability 
these countries include france  where we have a direct sales channel and japan  where we have both direct and indirect sales channels  as well as spain  italy  norway  sweden  denmark  finland  australia and new zealand  where we sell through distributors 
in each of the nine countries  excluding france  we assessed the credit worthiness and collectibility of our existing distributors and will continue to recognize revenue through these distributors upon cash receipt 
however  effective january   in france  where the country level criteria have been met and individual customers are deemed credit worthy  we will begin recognizing revenue upon shipment  rather than on cash receipt  after all other revenue recognition criteria under sop have been met  including  for resellers and distributors  evidence of sell through to an identified end user 
in the other nine countries where the individual distributors have not met the credit worthiness and collectibility requirements  we will continue to reassess their status quarterly 
in addition to selling directly to end users  we also enter into reseller and distributor arrangements that typically provide for sublicense or end user license fees based on a percentage of list prices 
revenue arrangements with resellers and distributors require evidence of sell through  that is  persuasive evidence that the products have been sold to an identified end user 
for data integration products  data warehouse modules and business intelligence platform sold indirectly through our resellers and distributors  we recognize revenue upon shipment and receipt of evidence of sell through if the reseller or distributor has been deemed credit worthy 
we also enter into oem arrangements that provide for license fees based on inclusion of our products in the oem s products 
these arrangements provide for fixed  irrevocable royalty payments 
for credit worthy oems  royalty payments are recognized based on the activity in the royalty report we receive from the oem  or in the case of oems with fixed royalty payments  revenue is recognized when the related payment is due 
when oems are not deemed credit worthy  revenue is recognized upon cash receipt 
in both cases  revenue is recognized after all other revenue recognition criteria under sop have been met 
the assessment of credit worthiness for resellers  distributors and oems within countries which have been deemed to be credit worthy generally takes place quarterly  with any changes effective at the beginning of the next fiscal quarter 
credit worthiness for these partners is assessed based on established credit history consisting of sales of at least one million dollars and with timely payment history  generally for the last months 
in the third quarter of  our assessment of three resellers and oems determined that these customers were credit worthy and effective october  we began recognizing revenue for these customers upon shipment  after all other revenue recognition criteria under sop have been met 
we recognized incremental revenue of million in the fourth quarter of from changing the revenue recognition related to these customers from a cash to accrual basis 
for transactions to all customers  including direct end users  resellers  distributors and oems  where the customer is deemed credit worthy  but where the stated payment terms of the transaction are greater than days from the invoice date  we recognize revenue when the payments become due 
in assessing this policy in light of our continuing international expansion where stated payment terms can be slightly longer  we determined  effective january   that extending the threshold to days on a world wide basis would be more appropriate 
therefore  effective january   we will begin recognizing revenue upon shipment for 
table of contents transactions with credit worthy customers in credit worthy countries with stated payment terms up to and including days  after all other revenue recognition criteria under sop have been met 
we have analyzed the impact of this change as though it had been implemented during and determined that this change would not have been material to our quarterly or annual revenue or results of operations in those transactions with stated terms of more than days will continue to be recognized when payments become due 
when a customer  including direct end users  resellers  distributors and oems  is not deemed credit worthy  revenue is recognized when cash is received  after all other revenue recognition criteria under sop have been met 
we ceased selling data warehouse modules in july for our analytic application suites  which we also ceased selling directly in july  we recognized both the license and maintenance revenue ratably over the initial maintenance period  generally one year  since we did not have vsoe of maintenance for our analytic application suites 
we recognize maintenance revenues  which consist of fees for ongoing support and product updates and upgrades  ratably over the term of the contract  typically one year 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation services and product enhancements performed on a time and materials basis or  on a very infrequent basis  a fixed fee arrangement under separate service arrangements related to the installation and implementation of our software products 
education services revenues are generated from classes offered at our headquarters  sales offices and customer locations 
revenues from consulting and education services are recognized as the services are performed 
when a contract includes both license and service elements  the license fee is recognized on delivery of the software or cash collections  provided services do not include significant customization or modification of the base product  and are not otherwise essential to the functionality of the software and the payment terms for licenses are not dependent on additional acceptance criteria 
deferred revenue includes deferred license  maintenance  consulting and education services revenues 
our practice is to net unpaid deferred items against the related receivables balances from those oems  specific resellers  distributors and specific international customers for which we defer revenue until payment is received 
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for sales returns on revenue in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates require management judgment and are based on historical sales returns and other known factors 
if these estimates do not adequately reflect future sales returns  revenue could be overstated 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance against amounts due to us 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  industry and geographic concentrations  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
for example  we recorded an additional bad debt expense in related to customers that filed for bankruptcy 
impairment of goodwill we assess goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined by sfas consistent with our determination that we have only one reporting segment  we have determined that there is only one reporting unit  specifically the license  implementation and support of our software products 
goodwill was tested for impairment in our annual impairment tests on october in each of the 
table of contents years in  and using the two step process required by sfas first  we reviewed the carrying amount of the reporting unit compared to the fair value of the reporting unit based on quoted market prices of our common stock and the discounted cash flows based on analyses prepared by management 
our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates being used to manage the business 
an excess carrying value compared to fair value would indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
second  if we determine that goodwill may be impaired  then we compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas  to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
based on these estimates  we determined in our annual impairment tests as of october of each year that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount and accordingly  goodwill was not impaired 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
accordingly  future changes in market capitalization or estimates used in discounted cash flows analyses could result in significantly different fair values of the reporting unit  which may result in impairment of goodwill 
restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of  we recorded significant charges restructuring plan related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters to take advantage of more favorable lease terms and reduced operating expenses 
in addition  we significantly increased the restructuring charges restructuring plan in the third and fourth quarters of due to changes in our assumptions used to calculate the original charge as a result of our decision to relocate our corporate headquarters 
the accrued restructuring charges represent gross lease obligations and estimated commissions and other costs principally leasehold improvements and asset write offs  offset by actual and estimated gross sublease income  which is net of estimated broker commissions and tenant improvement allowances  expected to be received over the remaining lease terms 
these liabilities include management s estimates pertaining to sublease activities 
inherent in the assessment of the costs related to our restructuring efforts are estimates related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
we will continue to evaluate the commercial real estate market conditions periodically to determine if our estimates of the amount and timing of future sublease income are reasonable based on current and expected commercial real estate market conditions 
our estimates of sublease income may vary significantly depending  in part  on factors which may be beyond our control  such as the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
if we determine that there is further deterioration in the estimated sublease rates or in the expected time it will take us to sublease our vacant space  we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future and our cash position could be adversely affected 
for example  we increased our restructuring plan charges in and based on the continued deterioration in the san francisco bay area and dallas  texas real estate markets 
see note  restructuring charges  of notes to consolidated financial statements in item future adjustments to the charges could result from a change in the time period that the buildings will be vacant  expected sublease rate  expected sublease terms and the expected time it will take to sublease 
we will periodically assess the need to update the original restructuring charges based on current real estate market information and trend analysis and executed sublease agreements 
deferred taxes we recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce all of our deferred tax assets to the amount that is likely to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  however  if it were determined that we would be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease our tax rate and increase income in the period in which such determination was made 
likewise  if we determined that we 
table of contents would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made

table of contents the following table and discussion compares our revenue by type for the three years ended december  year ended december  in millions license revenues service revenues maintenance revenues consulting and education services revenues total service revenues total revenues license revenues our license revenues were million in compared to million in and million in  representing an increase of million or in from and a decrease of million or in from the increase in license revenues in from was primarily due to million of incremental sales of our data integration platform products  including powercenter and superglue  partially offset by a million decrease in license revenue attributable to our discontinued analytical applications in in  we also experienced an increase in the average transaction amount for orders greater than  which increased to  in from  in in addition  the number of transactions greater than million increased to in from five in the million decrease in license revenue in from was primarily due to the weak it spending conditions in which negatively impacted license revenues 
in we experienced a decrease in the number of end user transactions and a decrease in the average transaction amount for orders greater than  which decreased to  in from  in additionally  a million negative adjustment in to correct the overallocation of license revenues and underallocation of service revenues resulting from an error in our allocation of revenue resulted in a further decrease of license revenue 
services revenues maintenance revenues maintenance revenues increased to million in from million in and million in  representing growth of million or in from and million or in from these increases in maintenance revenues in and were primarily due to an increased customer base and strong renewals of maintenance contracts 
additionally  in  we made a million positive adjustment to increase maintenance revenues to correct the underallocation of maintenance revenues resulting from an error in the allocation of revenue 
for  based on our growing installed customer base  we expect maintenance revenues to increase from the levels 
consulting and education services revenues consulting and education services revenues were million in  million in and million in the million or decrease in compared to and the million or decrease in from were primarily a result of underutilization of our consultants in europe 
for  we expect to increase utilization in europe and add overall consulting capacity  and thus expect revenues from consulting and education services to slightly increase from the levels 
international revenues our international revenues were million in  million in and million in  representing an increase of million  or  in from and an increase of million  or  in 
table of contents from the million increase in from in international revenues was primarily due to a increase in local currency license revenues  a increase in local currency maintenance revenues  and a increase in local currency education services revenues  offset by a decline in local currency consulting revenues in europe 
the million increase in from in international revenues was due primarily to a increase in maintenance revenues in europe due to a strong renewal base 
international revenues as a percentage of total revenues were  and for  and  respectively 
key factors affecting revenues certain key factors will affect our ability to meet our forecasted revenue in  including the following we typically experience a seasonal decrease in revenues in the first quarter of the year 
we experienced greater than usual sales force turnover during the first quarter of  which we believe negatively impacted our ability to generate license revenues in the first three quarters of we experienced reduced sales force turnover during the remainder of and we continued to add new sales personnel throughout the year 
because we typically experience lower productivity from newly hired sales personnel for a period of six to months  our ability to generate license revenues in the first quarter of may be adversely affected 
see risk factors an increase in turnover rates of our sales force personnel may negatively impact our ability to generate license revenues 
the recent general economic uncertainty caused customer purchases to be reduced in amount  deferred or cancelled  and therefore reduced the overall license pipeline conversion rates in much of and any interruption or delay in the current gradual recovery in the infrastructure software industry could cause a reduction in the rate of conversion of the sales pipeline into license revenue for the first quarter of and beyond 
see risk factors if we are unable to accurately forecast revenues  we may fail to meet stock analysts and investors expectations of our quarterly operating results  which could cause our stock price to decline and risk factors we have experienced reduced sales pipeline and pipeline conversion rates in the past  which has adversely affected the growth of our company and the price of our common stock 
in july  we ceased direct sales of our analytic application suites and data warehouse modules  which remain available to our indirect channel partners to sell 
we will not receive any future revenue from the distribution of our analytic application suites and data warehouse modules from our independent channel partners 
however  we may further use or sell elements of this technology in the future  which may generate revenues 
for example  in december  we licensed elements of this software technology to one of our strategic partners 
on february   we announced the release of powercenter advanced edition 
this edition of powercenter includes two previously at cost options  team based development and server grid  as well as two previously separate products  poweranalyzer and superglue 
we also announced on this date that we are removing these two options and these two separate products from our price list 
powercenter advanced edition is priced higher than the standard edition of powercenter but less than the aggregate price of all components previously sold separately 
because this edition of powercenter and its pricing are new  we cannot predict its impact on powercenter and overall revenues 
license revenue for did not include the full amount related to two large software license agreements signed in europe in the third quarter of we deferred the license revenues related to these software license agreements in september due to extended warranties that contain provisions for additional unspecified deliverables and began amortizing the deferred revenues balances to license revenues in september for a two to five year period 
while historically we have infrequently entered into software license agreements that require ratable recognition of license revenue  we may enter into software license agreements like these in the future 
as a result of these trends and continued uncertainty in it spending by our customers and prospects  our ability to meet our forecasted revenues for will continue to be highly dependent on our success in converting our sales pipeline into license revenues from orders received and shipped within the year 
see risk 
table of contents factors we have experienced and could continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  especially the amount of license revenue we recognize each quarter  and such fluctuations have caused and could continue to cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
in particular  our license revenues are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty 
furthermore  we have historically recognized a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of each quarter  and more recently  in the last few weeks of each quarter 
additionally  because the relocation of our corporate headquarters was accompanied by the shutdown of portions of our business in the last week of december  we experienced a slight reduction in our capacity to process and fulfill orders 
consequently  some orders that would have otherwise been processed in the last week of the fourth quarter were delayed until the first quarter of these events are not indicative of a typical fourth quarter  and should not be considered as a future trend related to our first quarter of  or for any other quarters in the future 
see risk factors we have experienced and could continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  especially the amount of license revenue we recognize each quarter  and such fluctuations have caused and could continue to cause our stock price to decline 
cost of revenues cost of license revenues our cost of license revenues consists primarily of software royalties  product packaging  documentation and production costs 
cost of license revenues was million in  million in and million in representing approximately  and of license revenues in  and  respectively 
the million increase was due primarily to increases in royalties due to changes in our percentage mix of royalty bearing products 
the million or decrease in from was primarily due to decreased royalty payments  including royalty payments to striva  which we ceased making following our acquisition of striva in september in addition  in we renegotiated a royalty bearing contract with one of our partners to decrease the royalty fee 
for  we expect the cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues to remain relatively consistent with the levels 
cost of service revenues our cost of service revenues is a combination of costs of maintenance  consulting and education services revenues 
our cost of maintenance revenues consists primarily of costs associated with customer service personnel expenses and royalty fees for maintenance related to third party software providers 
cost of consulting revenues consists primarily of personnel costs and expenses incurred in providing consulting services at customers facilities 
cost of education services revenues consists primarily of the costs of providing training classes and materials at our headquarters  sales and training offices and customer locations 
cost of service revenues was million in  million in and million in  representing  and of service revenues in  and  respectively 
the million or increase in from was primarily due to increased personnel related expenses from headcount growth in our customer support organization 
cost of service revenues in absolute dollars remained relatively flat in from  but as a percentage of service revenues decreased primarily due to the significant increase in the mix of maintenance revenues  which had less cost associated with it than other types of service revenues 
for  we expect our cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues to remain relatively constant  or increase slightly from the levels if the growth in our consulting services business  if any  is greater that experienced by our maintenance and education services business 
amortization of acquired technology amortization of acquired technology is the amortization of technologies acquired through business combinations 
amortization of acquired technology totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for  we expect amortization of acquired technology to be approximately million 

table of contents operating expenses research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses and consulting services associated with the development of new products  the enhancement and localization of existing products  quality assurance and development of documentation for our products 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the million or increase in from was primarily due to a million increase from a full year of costs in compared to approximately three months of costs in coupled with a million increase in stock based compensation both related to the striva acquisition  offset by a million decrease in personnel related expenses related to the expansion of our offshore development center in bangalore  india and a million decrease in legal expenses related to patent litigation 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the million or increase in from was due primarily to increases in outside consulting services totaling million and personnel related costs of million 
research and development expenses represented of total revenues in each of  and to date  all software and development costs have been expensed in the period incurred because costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant 
for  we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues to decrease from the levels 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including commissions  as well as costs of public relations  seminars  marketing programs  lead generation  travel and trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses increased million or in from and due primarily to increased personnel related costs from headcount growth of million  higher commission expense totaling million  travel related expenses of million  sales incentive events of million  stock based compensation of million offset by a decrease in marketing expenses of million 
sales and marketing expenses were consistent at million in and while sales and marketing expenses remained effectively flat from to  a few components of the expense fluctuated  including lower outside consulting service fees of million  offset by higher marketing and advertising related expenses of million 
sales and marketing expenses represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
for  we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues to remain relatively consistent with the levels 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  human resources  legal and general management  as well as professional services expense associated with recruiting  legal and accounting 
general and administrative expenses were million in and million in general and administrative expenses increased slightly to million in from million in the million or increase in expenses in from was primarily due to a million increase in personnel costs and million in fees paid to outside professional service providers  primarily for sarbanes oxley compliance  and other administrative fees  partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense totaling million 
the decrease in the bad debt expense was a result of a significantly decreased customer bankruptcy rate 
general and administrative expenses represented  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
we expect that for  our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues to remain relatively consistent with or slightly below the levels 
amortization of stock based compensation included in our costs and expenses are non cash charges for stock based compensation expense 
amortization of stock based compensation has been reclassified to cost of service revenues and research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the two years ended december  to conform with the 
table of contents presentation 
see note  description of the company and a summary of significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
total stock based compensation expense was as follows year ended december in thousands cost of service revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total stock based compensation stock based compensation expense amounted to million in  million in and million in the increase in was primarily related to the stock based compensation expense related to the striva acquisition 
we expect to record million in for amortization of stock based compensation related to the striva acquisition 
in through july  we recorded stock based compensation related to an outstanding stock option granted to our former ceo that was based on our future performance 
the variable term of the option was such that it required us to periodically remeasure the value of the grant based on the fair value of the stock and record related stock based compensation 
the stock based compensation related to this grant for was  in  we recorded a benefit of  for the deferred stock based compensation due to the decline the fair value of our common stock 
the stock option was cancelled in july purchased in process research and development based on our valuation of identified intangible assets held by striva when we acquired it in september  million of the total purchase price was allocated to purchased in process research and development  which was expensed in  in accordance with fin see note  business combinations  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring charges restructuring plan in october  we announced a restructuring plan restructuring plan related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters within redwood city  california 
in february  we successfully subleased  square feet of our previous corporate headquarters at pacific shores center for the remainder of the lease term through july with a right of termination by the tenant which is exercisable in july as a result  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million  consisting of million in estimated facility lease losses  comprised of the present value of lease payment obligations for the remaining nine year lease term at the previous corporate headquarters  net of actual and estimated sublease income  and million of leasehold improvement and asset write offs 
we have sublease income and estimated sublease income  including the reimbursement of certain property costs such as common area maintenance  insurance and property tax net of estimated broker commissions  of million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million in if the subtenant exercises the right of termination in and we are unable to sublease any of the related pacific shores facilities during the remaining lease terms through  restructuring charges related to the restructuring plan could increase by approximately million 
in future periods  we will record accretion on cash obligations related to the restructuring plan 
accretion represents imputed interest and is the difference between our non discounted future cash obligations and the discounted present value of these cash obligations 
we will recognize approximately million of accretion as a restructuring charge over the remaining term of the lease  or approximately nine 
table of contents years as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in going forward  our results of operations should be positively affected by a significant decrease in rent expense and decreases to non cash depreciation and amortization expense for the leasehold improvements and equipment written off 
we estimate that these combined savings will be approximately to million annually  after accretion charges 
restructuring plan in september  we announced a restructuring plan restructuring plan and recorded restructuring charges of approximately million  consisting of million related to estimated facility lease losses and million in leasehold improvement and asset write offs related to the consolidation of excess leased facilities in the san francisco bay area and texas 
in september  we recorded additional restructuring charges of approximately million  consisting of million related to estimated facility lease losses and million in leasehold improvement and asset write offs 
the timing of the restructuring accrual adjustment was a result of negotiated and executed subleases for our excess facilities in dallas  texas and palo alto  california during the third quarter of these subleases included terms that provided a lower level of sublease rates than the initial assumptions 
the terms of these new subleases were consistent with the continued deterioration of the commercial real estate market in these areas 
in addition  cost containment measures initiated in the same quarter  such as delayed hiring and salary reductions  resulted in an adjustment to our estimate of occupancy of available vacant facilities 
these charges represent adjustments to the original assumptions in the restructuring plan including  the time period that the buildings will be vacant  expected sublease rates  expected sublease terms and the estimated time to sublease 
we calculated the estimated costs for the additional restructuring charges based on current market information and trend analysis of the real estate market in the respective area 
during  we recorded additional restructuring charges of million related to estimated facility lease losses 
the restructuring accrual adjustments recorded in the third and fourth quarters of were the result of our decision in october to relocate our corporate headquarters within redwood city  california in december  an executed sublease for our excess facilities in palo alto  california during the third quarter of  and an adjustment to management s estimate of available vacant facilities 
these charges represent adjustments to the original assumptions in the restructuring plan including  the time period that the buildings will be vacant  expected sublease rates  expected sublease terms  and the estimated time to sublease 
we calculated the estimated costs for the additional restructuring charges based on current market information and trend analysis of the real estate market in the respective area 
if we are unable to sublease any of the available vacant pacific shores facilities included in our restructuring plan during the remaining lease term through  restructuring charges could increase by approximately million 
net cash payments for  and for facilities included in the restructuring plan amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
actual future cash requirements may differ from the restructuring liability balances as of december  if there are changes to the time period that facilities are vacant or the actual sublease income is different from current estimates

the million or increase in from was primarily a result of the ascential settlement of million in and a million decrease in losses on property and equipment  partially offset by million in lower interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted stock 
we currently do not engage in any foreign currency hedging activities and  therefore  are susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange gains or losses in our results of operations in future reporting periods

recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved the consensus reached on the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the issue s objective is to provide guidance for identifying other than temporarily impaired investments 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp eitf that delays the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance in eitf until after further deliberations by the fasb 
the disclosure requirements of eitf are effective beginning with informatica s fiscal annual report 
once the fasb reaches a final decision on the measurement and recognition provisions  we will evaluate the impact of the adoption of eitf in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  sfas r share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 sfas accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted 
table of contents after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a prospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas r for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
sfas r must be adopted no later than in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt sfas r in the first interim period beginning after june  although we have not completed our evaluation of the impact of this accounting pronouncement  the adoption of sfas r is expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall cash position 
although we have not completed our evaluation of the impact of this accounting pronouncement  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  however  there were no amounts recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions in our reported operating cash flows 
on december   the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fsp  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provisions within the american jobs creation act of the jobs act 
fsp provides guidance with respect to reporting the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the jobs act on an enterprise s income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
the jobs act was enacted on october   and provides for a temporary dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company s chief executive officer and approved by a company s board of directors 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
fsp states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings 
although we have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact of the repatriation provisions of the jobs act  the company does not expect that these provisions will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations  or liquidity 
accordingly  as provided for in fsp  we have not adjusted our tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the jobs act in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
sfas eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for periods beginning after june  we do not expect that adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations  or liquidity 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily through cash flows from operations and public offerings of our common stock 
as of december   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and million of restricted cash under the terms of our pacific shores property leases 
operating activities operating activities provided cash of million in  million in and million in net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to the net loss of million  adjusted for million of non cash charges for deprecation and amortization  restructuring charges  and amortization of stock based compensation  intangible assets and acquired technology 
a significant amount of cash received from deferred revenues  which typically is recognized within the next twelve months  increased net cash provided by operating activities 
the million increase in deferred revenues was offset by payments of our accrued liabilities of million  accrued restructuring charges of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million in the operating cash inflows in were primarily due to the net income of million  the benefit of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  purchased in process research and development  and amortization of intangible assets totaling million  a decrease in prepaids and other assets of million and an increase in accounts payable of million

investing activities investing activities used cash of million in  million in and million in in  million was associated with the purchases of short term investments and million was associated with the purchase of property and equipment  offset by generated from the sale and maturities of short term investments 
short term investments represent investments in high credit quality corporate notes and bonds  municipals and us government bonds with durations of up to two years in accordance with our investment policy

in  financing activities provided cash of million  consisting of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sales of common stock of million  offset by the repurchase and retirement of common stock of million 
we believe that our cash balances and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  because our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a decrease in customer demand or the acceptance of our products  we may not in the future be able to generate positive cash flows from operations 
if this occurred  we would require additional funds to support our working capital requirements  or for other purposes  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private 
table of contents equity financings or from other sources 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing at that time 
any financing we obtain may dilute our shareholders ownership interests 
contractual obligations and operating leases the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods contractual obligations payment due by period and and and total thereafter in thousands operating lease obligations operating lease payments sublease income net operating lease obligations other obligations total other purchase obligations and commitments include minimum royalty payments under license agreements and do not include purchase obligations discussed below 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of certain goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
operating leases we lease certain office facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating leases 
during  and  we recorded restructuring charges related to the consolidation of excess leased facilities in the san francisco bay area and texas 
operating lease payments in the table above include approximately million  net of actual sublease income  for operating lease commitments for those facilities that are included in restructuring charges 
see note  lease obligations  and note  restructuring charges  in notes to the consolidated financial statements in item we have sublease agreements for leased office space in palo alto  san francisco  scotts valley and redwood city  california and carrollton  texas 
in the event the sublessees are unable to fulfill their obligations  we would be responsible for rent due under the leases 
however  we expect the sublessees will fulfill their obligations under these leases 

table of contents in february  we entered into two lease agreements for two buildings in redwood city  california our former corporate headquarters  which we occupied from august through december the lease expires in july as part of these agreements  we have purchased certificates of deposit totaling million as a security deposit for lease payments until certain financial milestones are met 
the letter of credit may be reduced to an amount not less than three months of the base rent at the then current rate if our annual revenues reach million and we have quarterly operating profits of at least million for no less than four consecutive calendar quarters 
these certificates of deposit are classified as long term restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
other uses of cash in july  our board of directors authorized a one year stock repurchase program for up to five million shares of our common stock 
purchases may be made from time to time in the open market and will be funded from available working capital 
the number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the level of our cash balances and general business and market conditions 
in  we purchased  shares at a cost of million under this program 
these shares were retired and reclassified as authorized and unissued shares of common stock 
from january  through february   we repurchased  shares of our common stock in the open market at a cost of approximately million under this program 
purchases may be made from time to time in the open market and will be funded from available working capital 
in september  our board of directors authorized a one year stock repurchase program for up to five million shares of our common stock 
purchases were made from time to time in the open market and were funded from available working capital 
the number and timing of shares purchased were based on the level of our cash balances  general business and market conditions  and other factors  including alternative investment opportunities 
under this program  we repurchased  and  shares of our common stock for million and million in and  respectively 
these shares were retired and reclassified as authorized and unissued shares of common stock 
on september   this one year stock repurchase program expired 
we may continue to execute share repurchases from time to time in order to take advantage of attractive share price levels  as determined by management and approved by the board of directors 
the timing and terms of the transactions will depend on market conditions  our liquidity and other considerations 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or transactions  arrangements or relationships with special purpose entities 

table of contents risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form k  we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
we have experienced and could continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  especially the amount of license revenue we recognize each quarter  and such fluctuations have caused and could continue to cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations have caused our stock price to experience declines in the past and could cause our stock price to significantly fluctuate or experience declines in the future 
one of the reasons why our operating results have fluctuated is that our license revenues are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty and are vulnerable to short term shifts in customer demand 
for example  we have experienced customer order deferrals in anticipation of future new product introductions or product enhancements  as well as the particular budgeting and purchase cycles of our customers 
by comparison  our short term expenses are relatively fixed and based in part on our expectations of future revenues 
moreover  we typically do not have a substantial backlog of license orders at the end of a fiscal period 
historically  this has particularly been the case at the end of the first and third fiscal quarters 
for example  in the three months ended march   we experienced greater seasonal reduction in license orders than we expected 
because we typically do not have a substantial backlog of license orders  our license revenues generally reflect orders shipped in the same quarter they are received  and as a result  we do not have significant visibility of expected results for future quarters 
furthermore  we recognize a substantial portion of our license revenues in the last month of each quarter  and more recently  in the last few weeks of each quarter 
as a result  we cannot predict the adverse impact caused by cancellations or delays in orders until the end of each quarter 
additionally  because the relocation of our corporate headquarters was accompanied by the shutdown of portions of our business in the last week of december  we experienced a slight reduction in our capacity to process and fulfill orders 
consequently  some orders that would have otherwise been processed in the last week of the fourth quarter of were delayed until the first quarter of these events are not indicative of a typical fourth quarter or first quarter  and should not be considered as a future trend 
due to the difficulty we experience in predicting our quarterly license revenues  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
furthermore  our future operating results could fail to meet the expectations of stock analysts and investors 
if this happens  the price of our common stock could fall 
if we are unable to accurately forecast revenues  we may fail to meet stock analysts and investors expectations of our quarterly operating results  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we use a pipeline system  a common industry practice  to forecast sales and trends in our business 
our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals  including the date when they estimate that a customer will make a purchase decision and the potential dollar amount of the sale 
we aggregate these estimates periodically in order to generate a sales pipeline 
we compare the pipeline at various points in time to look for trends in our business 
while this pipeline analysis may provide us with some guidance in business planning and budgeting  these pipeline estimates are necessarily speculative and may not consistently correlate to revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time 
additionally  because we have historically recognized a substantial portion of our license revenues in the last month of each quarter  and more recently  in the last few weeks of each quarter  we may not be able to adjust our cost structure in a timely manner in response to variations in the conversion of the sales pipeline into license revenues 
any change in the conversion of the pipeline into customer sales or in the pipeline itself could cause us to improperly budget for future expenses that are in line with our expected future revenues  which would adversely affect our operating margins and results of operations and could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

table of contents we have experienced reduced sales pipeline and pipeline conversion rates in the past  which have adversely affected the growth of our company and the price of our common stock 
in  we experienced a reduced conversion rate of our overall license pipeline  primarily as a result of the general economic slowdown which caused the amount of customer purchases to be reduced  deferred or cancelled 
in the first half of  we continued to experience a decrease in our sales pipeline as well as our pipeline conversion rate  primarily as a result of the negative impact of the war in iraq on the capital spending budgets of our customers  as well as the continued general economic slowdown 
while the us economy improved in the second half of and in  we experienced  and continue to experience  uncertainty regarding our sales pipeline and our ability to convert potential sales of our products into revenue 
if we are unable to increase the size of our sales pipeline and our pipeline conversion rate  our results of operations could fail to meet the expectations of stock analysts and investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting  we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  section and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec to implement section  we are required to furnish a report to include in our form k an annual report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting requires management to make subjective judgments and  because this requirement to provide a management report is newly effective  some of our judgments will be in areas that may be open to interpretation 
therefore our management report may be uniquely difficult to prepare and our auditors  who are required to issue an attestation report along with our management s report  may not agree with management s assessments 
while we currently believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective  the effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  and  as a result  the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which would have an adverse effect on our stock price 
additionally  we continue to experience turnover in our finance and accounting personnel and shifts in responsibilities at the management level 
these personnel and responsibility changes adversely affected our ability to effectively follow our internal controls and contributed to a significant deficiency regarding our controls over license revenue recognition in the third quarter of we corrected this deficiency in the fourth quarter of by establishing additional controls to review revenue transactions 
we will continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting by adding resources and procedures  as necessary 
an increase in the turnover rate of our sales force personnel may negatively impact our ability to generate license revenues 
we experienced an increased level of turnover in our direct sales force in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of this increase in the turnover rate impacted our ability to generate license revenues in the first nine months of although we have hired replacements in our sales force  we typically experience lower productivity from newly hired sales personnel for a period of six to months 
if we are unable to 
table of contents effectively train such new personnel  or if we continue to experience a heightened level of sales force turnover  our ability to generate license revenues may be negatively impacted 
the loss of our key personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel could adversely affect our ability to grow our company successfully 
we believe our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel and key members of our management team 
we continue to experience changes in members of our senior management team 
for example  we recently hired john entenmann as our executive vice president  corporate strategy and marketing and paul hoffman as our executive vice president  worldwide sales 
accordingly  until such new senior personnel become familiar with our business strategy and systems  their integration could result in some disruption to our ongoing operations 
in july  gaurav s 
dhillon  one of our founders and former president and chief executive officer  resigned 
we are uncertain about the potential impact of his departure  and there exists the possibility of the loss of key personnel and significant employee turnover 
we currently do not have any key man life insurance relating to our key personnel  and their employment is at will and not subject to employment contracts 
we have relied on our ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining highly skilled talent 
potential accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options may impair our future ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel 
if we do not compete effectively with companies selling data integration products  our revenues may not grow and could decline 
the market for our products is highly competitive  quickly evolving and subject to rapidly changing technology 
our competition consists of hand coded  custom built data integration solutions developed in house by various companies in the industry segments that we target  as well as other vendors of integration software products  including ascential software  embarcadero technologies  group software  sas institute and certain privately held companies 
in the past  we have competed with business intelligence vendors that currently offer  or may develop  products with functionalities that compete with our products  such as business objects  cognos  hyperion solutions  microstrategy and certain privately held companies 
we also compete against certain database and enterprise application vendors  which offer products that typically operate specifically with these competitors proprietary databases 
such potential competitors include ibm  microsoft  oracle  sap and siebel systems 
many of these competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  or greater name recognition than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell additional products and services on terms favorable to us 
our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive 
we believe we currently compete more on the basis of our products functionality than on the basis of price 
if our competitors develop products with similar or superior functionality  we may have difficulty competing on the basis of price 
our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions  consolidate their operations or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other solution providers  thereby increasing their ability to provide a broader suite of software products or solutions and more effectively address the needs of our prospective customers 
our current and potential competitors may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future strategic partners  thereby limiting our ability to sell products through these channels 
if any of this were to occur  our ability to market and sell our software products would be impaired 
in addition  competitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce our prices  either of which could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we may not successfully integrate striva s technology  employees or business operations with our own 
as a result  we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisition  which could adversely affect our operating results and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
in september  we acquired striva corporation  a provider of mainframe data integration solutions 
the successful integration of striva s technology  employees and business operations will place an additional burden on our management and infrastructure 
this acquisition  and any others we may make in the future  will subject us to a number of risks  including the failure to capture the value of the business we acquired  including the loss of any key personnel  customers and business relationships  an inability to generate revenue from the combined products that offsets the associated acquisition and maintenance costs  the assumption of any contracts or agreements from striva that contain terms or conditions that are unfavorable to us  the loss of key personnel due to the relocation of striva s european headquarters  and unsettled legal or tax liabilities incurred by striva prior to the acquisition 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with our striva acquisition or any future acquisitions 
to the extent that we are unable to successfully manage these risks  our business  operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected  and the price of our common stock could decline 
we rely on our relationships with our strategic partners 
if we do not maintain and strengthen these relationships  our ability to generate revenue and control expenses could be adversely affected  which could cause a decline in the price of our common stock 
we believe that our ability to increase the sales of our products depends in part upon maintaining and strengthening relationships with our strategic partners and any future strategic partners 
in addition to our direct sales force  we rely on established relationships with a variety of strategic partners  such as systems integrators  resellers and distributors  for marketing  licensing  implementing and supporting our products in the united states and internationally 
we also rely on relationships with strategic technology partners  such as enterprise application providers  database vendors  data quality vendors and enterprise integrator vendors  for the promotion and implementation of our products 
our strategic partners offer products from several different companies  including  in some cases  products that compete with our products 
we have limited control  if any  as to whether these strategic partners devote adequate resources to promoting  selling and implementing our products as compared to our competitors products 
we may not be able to maintain our strategic partnerships or attract sufficient additional strategic partners who have the ability to market our products effectively  are qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service or have the technical expertise and personnel resources necessary to implement our products for our customers 
in particular  if our strategic partners do not devote sufficient resources to implement our products  we may incur substantial additional costs associated with hiring and training additional qualified technical personnel to implement solutions for our customers in a timely manner 
furthermore  our relationships with our strategic partners may not generate enough revenue to offset the significant resources used to develop these relationships 
if we are unable to leverage the strength of our strategic partnerships to generate additional revenue  our revenues and the price of our common stock could decline 

table of contents if the current improvement in the us economy does not result in increased sales of our products and services  our operating results would be harmed  and the price of our common stock could decline 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in the domestic and global economy 
we experienced the adverse effect of the economic slowdown in and the first six months of  which resulted in a significant reduction in capital spending by our customers  as well as longer sales cycles  and the deferral or delay of purchases of our products 
in addition  terrorist actions and the military actions in afghanistan and iraq magnified and prolonged the adverse effects of the economic slowdown 
although the us economy improved beginning in the third quarter of  and we have experienced some improvement in our pipeline conversion rate  we may not experience any significant improvement in our pipeline conversion rate in the future 
in particular  our ability to forecast and rely on us federal government orders  especially potential orders from the us department of defense  is uncertain due to congressional budget constraints and changes in spending priorities 
if the current improvement in the us economy does not result in increased sales of our products and services  our results of operations could fail to meet the expectations of stock analysts and investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
moreover  if the current economic conditions in europe and asia do not improve or if there is an escalation in regional or global conflicts  we may fall short of our revenue expectations for although we have seen improvement in our european revenues  we may experience difficulties in our pipeline conversion rate or be negatively impacted by the effects of an economic slowdown in europe in the future  which may impact our ability to meet our revenue expectations for although we are investing in asia  there are significant risks with overseas investments and our growth prospects in asia are uncertain 
in addition  we could experience delays in the payment obligations of our world wide reseller customers if they experience weakness in the end user market  which would increase our credit risk exposure and harm our financial condition 
as a result of our products lengthy sales cycles  our expected revenues are susceptible to fluctuations  which could cause us to fail to meet stock analysts and investors expectations  resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock 
due to the expense  broad functionality and company wide deployment of our products  our customers decision to purchase our products typically requires the approval of their executive decision makers 
in addition  we frequently must educate our potential customers about the full benefits of our products  which also can require significant time 
further  our sales cycle may lengthen as we continue to focus our sales efforts on large corporations 
as a result of these factors  the length of time from our initial contact with a customer to the customer s decision to purchase our products typically ranges from three to nine months 
we are subject to a number of significant risks as a result of our lengthy sales cycle  including our customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance review procedures  the timing of our customers budget cycles  the seasonality of technology purchases  which historically has resulted in stronger sales of our products in the fourth quarter of the year  especially when compared to lighter sales in the first quarter of the year  our customers concerns about the introduction of our products or new products from our competitors  or potential downturns in general economic or political conditions that could occur during the sales cycle 
if our sales cycle lengthens unexpectedly  it could adversely affect the timing of our revenues or increase costs  which may independently cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations 
finally  if we are unsuccessful in closing sales of our products after spending significant funds and management resources  our operating margins and results of operations could be adversely impacted  and the price of our common stock could decline 

table of contents if the market in which we sell our products and services does not grow as we anticipate  we may not be able to increase our revenues at an acceptable rate of growth  and the price of our common stock could decline 
the market for software products that enable more effective business decision making by helping companies aggregate and utilize data stored throughout an organization  is relatively new and still emerging 
substantially all of our revenues are attributable to the sale of products and services in this market 
our potential customers may not fully value the benefits of using our products  not achieve favorable results using our products  experience technical difficulties in implementing our products  or use alternative methods to solve the problems addressed by our products 
if this market does not grow as we anticipate  we would not be able to sell as much of our software products and services as we currently expect  which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
we rely on the sale of a limited number of products  and if these products do not achieve broad market acceptance  our revenues would be adversely affected 
to date  substantially all of our revenues have been derived from our data integration products such as powercenter  powermart  powerconnect and related services  and to a lesser extent  our analytic application suites  data warehouse modules  business intelligence products and related services 
because we ceased direct sales of our analytic application suites and data warehouse modules in july  we expect sales of our data integration software and related services to comprise substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
if any of our products do not achieve market acceptance  our revenues and stock price could decrease 
in particular  with the completion of our striva acquisition  we began selling and marketing powerexchange as part of our complete product offering 
market acceptance for powerexchange  as well as our current products  could be affected if  among other things  competition substantially increases in the enterprise analytic software marketplace or transactional applications suppliers integrate their products to such a degree that the utility of the data integration functionality that our products provide is minimized or rendered unnecessary 
we may not be able to successfully manage the growth of our business if we are unable to improve our internal systems  processes and controls 
we need to continue to improve our internal systems  processes and controls to effectively manage our operations and growth 
we may not be able to successfully implement improvements to these systems  processes and controls in an efficient or timely manner  and we may discover deficiencies in existing systems  processes and controls 
we have licensed technology from third parties to help us accomplish this objective 
the support services available for such third party technology may be negatively affected by mergers and consolidation in the software industry  and support services for such technology may not be available to us in the future 
we may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems  processes and controls or in connection with third party software  which could disrupt existing customer relationships  causing us to lose customers  limit us to smaller deployments of our products or increase our technical support costs 

table of contents the price of our common stock fluctuates as a result of factors other than our operating results  such as the actions of our competitors and securities analysts  as well as developments in our industry and changes in accounting rules 
the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors other than our operating results  including the announcement of new products or product enhancements by our competitors  quarterly variations in our competitors results of operations  changes in earnings estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  developments in our industry  and changes in accounting rules 
after periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
we and certain of our former officers and our directors have been named as defendants in a purported class action complaint  which was filed on behalf of certain persons who purchased our common stock between april  and december  such actions could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate when we account for employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans using the fair value method  which could significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  which will require us to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value at the date of grant and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
sfas r is effective for first interim periods beginning after june  although we have not completed our evaluation of the impact of this accounting pronouncement  the adoption of sfas r is expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations  as we expect the adoption of sfas r will result in an increase in our operating expenses and a reduction in our net income and earnings per share  all of which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
if our products are unable to interoperate with hardware and software technologies that are developed and maintained by third parties that are not within our control  our ability to develop and sell our products to our customers could be adversely affected which would result in harm to our business and operating results 
our products are designed to interoperate with and provide access to a wide range of third party developed and maintained hardware and software technologies  which are used by our customers 
the future design and development plans of the third parties that maintain these technologies are not within our control and may not be in line with our future product development plans 
we may also rely on such third parties to provide us with access to these technologies so that we can properly test and develop our products to interoperate with the third party technologies 
these third parties may in the future refuse or otherwise be unable to provide us with the necessary access to their technologies 
in addition  these third parties may decide to design or develop their technologies in a manner that would not be interoperable with our own 
if either of these situations occur  we would not be able to continue to market our products as interoperable with such third party hardware and software  which could adversely affect our ability to successfully sell our products to our customers 

table of contents we rely on a number of different distribution channels to sell and market our products 
any conflicts that we may experience within these various distribution channels could result in confusion for our customers and a decrease in revenue and operating margins 
we have a number of relationships with resellers  systems integrators and distributors that assist us in obtaining broad market coverage for our products and services 
although our discount policies  sales commission structure and reseller licensing programs are intended to support each distribution channel with a minimum level of channel conflicts  we may not be able to minimize these channel conflicts in the future 
any channel conflicts that we may experience could result in confusion for our customers and a decrease in revenue and operating margins 
any significant defect in our products could cause us to lose revenue and expose us to product liability claims 
the software products we offer are inherently complex and  despite extensive testing and quality control  have in the past and may in the future contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced 
these defects and errors could cause damage to our reputation  loss of revenue  product returns  order cancellations or lack of market acceptance of our products 
we have in the past and may in the future need to issue corrective releases of our software products to fix these defects or errors 
for example  we issued corrective releases to fix problems with the version of our powermart released in the first quarter of as a result  we had to allocate significant customer support resources to address these problems 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future national  federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entails the risk of such claims  which could be substantial in light of the use of our products in enterprise wide environments 
in addition  our insurance against product liability may not be adequate to cover a potential claim 
if we are unable to successfully respond to technological advances and evolving industry standards  we could experience a reduction in our future product sales  which would cause our revenues to decline 
the market for our products is characterized by continuing technological development  evolving industry standards  changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the introduction of products by our direct competitors or others embodying new technologies  the emergence of new industry standards or changes in customer requirements could render our existing products obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive 
in particular  an industry wide adoption of uniform open standards across heterogeneous applications could minimize the importance of the integration functionality of our products and materially adversely affect the competitiveness and market acceptance of our products 
our success depends upon our ability to enhance existing products  to respond to changing customer requirements and to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that keep pace with technological and competitive developments and emerging industry standards 
we have in the past experienced delays in releasing new products and product enhancements and may experience similar delays in the future 
as a result  in the past  some of our customers deferred purchasing our products until the next upgrade was released 
future delays or problems in the installation or implementation of our new releases may cause customers to forego purchases of our products and purchase those of our competitors instead 
additionally  even if we are able to develop new products and product enhancements  we cannot ensure that they will achieve market acceptance 
we recognize revenue from specific customers at the time we receive payment for our products  and if these customers do not make timely payment  our revenues could decrease 
based on limited credit history  we recognize revenue from direct end users  resellers  distributors and oems  which have not been deemed credit worthy  at the time we receive payment for our products  rather 
table of contents than at the time of sale 
if these customers do not make timely payment for our products  our revenues could decrease 
if our revenues decrease  the price of our common stock may fall 
we have a limited operating history and a cumulative net loss  which makes it difficult to evaluate our operations  products and prospects for the future 
we were incorporated in and began selling our products in  therefore  we have a limited operating history upon which investors can evaluate our operations  products and prospects 
with the exception of  when we had net income of million  since our inception we have incurred significant annual net losses  resulting in an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we cannot ensure that we will be able to sustain profitability in the future 
if we are unable to sustain profitability  we may fail to meet the expectations of stock analysts and investors  and the price of our common stock may fall 
our international operations expose us to greater intellectual property  collections  exchange rate fluctuations  regulatory and other risks  which could limit our future growth 
we have significant operations outside the united states  including software development centers in india  the netherlands and the united kingdom  sales offices in belgium  canada  france  germany  the netherlands  switzerland and the united kingdom  and customer support centers in the netherlands  india and the united kingdom 
our international operations face numerous risks 
for example  in order to sell our products in certain foreign countries  our products must be localized  that is  customized to meet local user needs 
developing local versions of our products for foreign markets is difficult  requires us to incur additional expenses and can take longer than we anticipate 
we currently have limited experience in localizing products and in testing whether these localized products will be accepted in the targeted countries 
we cannot assure you that our localization efforts will be successful 
in addition  we have only a limited history of marketing  selling and supporting our products and services internationally 
as a result  we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations 
however  we have experienced difficulties in recruiting  training and managing an international staff  and we may continue to experience such difficulties in the future 
we must also be able to enter into strategic distributor relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence 
if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships  our future success in these international markets could be limited 
our software development centers in india  the netherlands and the united kingdom also subject our business to certain risks  including greater difficulty in protecting our ownership rights to intellectual property developed in foreign countries  which may have laws that materially differ from those in the united states  communication delays between our main development center in redwood shores  california and our development centers in india  the netherlands and the united kingdom as a result of time zone differences  which may delay the development  testing or release of new products  greater difficulty in relocating existing trained development personnel and recruiting local experienced personnel  and the costs and expenses associated with such activities  and increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for the development centers 
additionally  our international operations as a whole are subject to a number of risks  including the following greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles  greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices  tariffs  and tax laws and treaties  
table of contents greater risk of a failure of our for foreign employees to comply with both us and foreign laws  including antitrust regulations  the foreign corrupt practices act  and unfair trade regulations  business practices with european and other foreign governments and entities may differ from those in north america and may require us to include terms in our software license agreements  such as extended warranty terms  that will require us to defer license revenue and recognize it ratably over the warranty term or other performance obligation included within the agreement  potential conflicts with our established distributors in countries in which we elect to establish a direct sales presence  our limited experience in establishing a sales and marketing presence in asia  especially china and korea  fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business because we do not engage in any hedging activities  and general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets 
these factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenues and  consequently  materially impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our failure to manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business 
the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources 
if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights  third parties could develop and market products that are equivalent to our own  which would harm our sales efforts 
our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we believe that our product developments  product enhancements  name recognition and the technological and innovative skills of our personnel are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret rights  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
however  these legal rights and contractual agreements may provide only limited protection 
our pending patent applications may not be allowed or our competitors may successfully challenge the validity or scope of any of our nine issued patents or any future issued patents 
our patents alone may not provide us with any significant competitive advantage  and third parties may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around our patents 
third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
we cannot easily monitor any unauthorized use of our products  and  although we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy is a prevalent problem in our industry in general 
the risk of not adequately protecting our proprietary technology and our exposure to competitive pressures may be increased if a competitor should resort to unlawful means in competing against us 
for example  in july we settled a complaint against ascential software corporation in which a number of former informatica employees recruited and hired by ascential  misappropriated our trade secrets  including sensitive product and marketing information and detailed sales information regarding existing and potential customers and unlawfully used that information to benefit ascential in gaining a competitive advantage against us 
although we were ultimately successful in this lawsuit  there are no assurances that we will be successful in protecting our proprietary technology from competitors in the future 
we have entered into agreements with many of our customers and partners that require us to place the source code of our products into escrow 
such agreements generally provide that such parties will have a limited  non exclusive right to use such code if there is a bankruptcy proceeding by or against us  we cease to do business  or we fail to meet our support obligations 
although our agreements with these third parties limit the scope of rights to use of the source code  we may be unable to effectively control such third party s actions 

table of contents furthermore  effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in various foreign countries 
the protection of our proprietary rights may be inadequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any patents or other intellectual property rights we hold 
we may be forced to initiate litigation in order to protect our proprietary rights 
for example  on july   we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against acta technology  inc although this lawsuit is in the discovery stage  litigating claims related to the enforcement of proprietary rights can be very expensive and can be burdensome in terms of management time and resources  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 
as is common in the software industry  we have received and may continue from time to time to receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third party patent and other proprietary rights 
as the number of software products in our target markets increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  we may become increasingly subject to claims by a third party that our technology infringes such party s proprietary rights 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
although we do not believe that we are currently infringing any proprietary rights of others  legal action claiming patent infringement could be commenced against us  and we may not prevail in such litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in patent litigation 
the potential effects on our business that may result from a third party infringement claim include the following we may be forced to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all  we may be required to indemnify our customers or obtain replacement products or functionality for our customers  we may be forced to significantly increase our development efforts and resources to redesign our products as a result of these claims  and we may be forced to discontinue the sale of some or all of our products 
we may engage in future acquisitions or investments that could dilute our existing stockholders  or cause us to incur contingent liabilities  debt or significant expense 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of  or investments in  related businesses  products or technologies 
future acquisitions and investments like these could result in the issuance of dilutive equity securities  the incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities  or the payment of cash to purchase equity securities from third parties 
there can be no assurance that any strategic acquisition or investment will succeed 
delaware law  as well as our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  contains provisions that could deter potential acquisition bids  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  discourage merger offers and prevent changes in our management or board of directors 
our basic corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that might discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of informatica or a change in our management 
our bylaws provide that we have a classified board of directors  with each class of directors subject to re election every three years 
this classified board has the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to insert their representatives on our board of directors and gain control of informatica 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
the existence of 
table of contents these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in addition  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan 
under the plan  we issued a dividend of one right for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record as of november   and such rights will become exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events 
because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our board of directors  the plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock without first negotiating with our board of directors regarding such acquisition 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future  which may not be available on reasonable terms to us  if at all 
we may not generate sufficient revenue from operations to offset our operating or other expenses 
as a result  in the future  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
we may not be able to borrow money or sell more of our equity securities to meet our cash needs 
even if we are able to do so  it may not be on terms that are favorable or reasonable to us 
if we are not able to raise additional capital when we need it in the future  our business could be seriously harmed 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications or network failure and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan 
our facilities in the state of california are currently subject to electrical blackouts as a consequence of a shortage of available electrical power  which occurred during in the event these blackouts are reinstated  they could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities 
in connection with the shortage of available power  prices for electricity may continue to increase in the foreseeable future 
such price changes will increase our operating costs  which could negatively impact our profitability 
in addition  we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur  and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments consist primarily of commercial paper  us government notes and bonds  corporate bonds and municipal securities 
all investments are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
as of december   the average rate of return on our investments was 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of december   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by less than million 
declines in interest rates could  over time  reduce our interest income 
foreign currency risk we market and sell our software and services through our direct sales force and indirect channel partners in the united states as well as belgium  canada  france  germany  the netherlands  switzerland and the united kingdom and japan 
we also have relationships with indirect channel partners in other regions including europe  asia pacific  australia  japan and latin america 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign 
table of contents markets 
as an example  the strengthening of the us dollar compared to any of the local currencies in the markets in which we do business could make our products less competitive in these markets 
as our sales are primarily in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
because we translate foreign currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations  especially between the us dollar and the euro and great britain pound  may have an impact on our quarterly financial results 
to date  we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities
