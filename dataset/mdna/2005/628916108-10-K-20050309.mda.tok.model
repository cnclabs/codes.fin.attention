table of contents overview our products and facilities we are a domestic producer of seamless and welded tubular steel products serving the energy industry 
we conduct our business within a single reportable business segment  which we refer to as the energy products segment 
our tubular products  commonly referred to as oil country tubular goods octg  are used primarily in oil and natural gas drilling exploration and production operations 
we also manufacture line pipe  which is used as gathering lines for the transmission of petrochemicals and hydrocarbons 
our products are manufactured and sold under two brands 
our koppel brand is our seamless tubular product manufactured at our facility located near koppel  pennsylvania 
our newport brand is our welded tubular product manufactured at our tubular facilities located near newport  kentucky 
the primary geographic market for our products is the southwestern  western and appalachian regions of the united states  as well as western regions of canada 
we also operate tubular finishing facilities in the southwest united states  where we can provide further finishing processes to our product 
economic and industry wide factors that affect our business demand for our products over of our revenues are derived from the sale of octg 
therefore  our revenue is directly dependent on the demand for octg  which is highly cyclical in nature 
there are a number of factors that we monitor to assist us in estimating the future demand for our octg product 
demand for our octg products is dependent on the number and depth of oil and natural gas wells being drilled in the united states and globally 
the level of drilling activity is  among other things  dependent on the current and anticipated supply and demand for oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices are volatile and can have a substantial effect upon drilling levels and resulting demand for our energy related products 
shipments by domestic producers of octg products may also be positively or negatively affected by the amount of inventory held by producers  distributors and end users  as well as by imports of octg products 
pie chart 
table of contents the average number of oil and gas drilling rigs operating in the united states rig count  domestic shipments of octg products excluding exports  octg imports and inventories for  and were as follows average natural gas price per mcf average us rig count domestic octg shipments millions of tons octg imports millions of tons octg inventories millions of tons at year end inventory tons per rig at year end source baker hughes  preston pipe and tube report and company estimates the following charts provide graphic illustration of certain information in the above table

table of contents a weak economy and mild weather in the latter part of resulted in historically high levels of natural gas in storage at the beginning of  thereby depressing natural gas prices  particularly in the first half of natural gas prices rose steadily in the latter months of and into due to the low drilling levels during  which negatively impacted natural gas supply going into  while demand for natural gas improved  driven primarily by the winter weather of these factors  together with an improving us economy  particularly in the second half of  resulted in an increase in the rig count of over natural gas prices improved further in on improved demand  based in part on a us economy that experienced real gdp growth of 
as a result  rig count in rose over  thereby positively impacting shipments and pricing of our octg products 
based upon current settlement prices for natural gas futures  economists forecasts of real gdp growth in  as well as other factors  we estimate the rig count will average  in the rig count as of february  was  the amount of octg inventory in the marketplace also affects demand for our products 
us end users obtain octg from domestic and foreign tubular producers and from draw downs of inventory from the end user  distributor or tubular producers 
while the absolute levels of octg inventories at december  increased to million tons  or  over  the amount of inventory tons per rig increased only  to  which we believe represents a historically low level of inventory relative to active rigs 
therefore  we believe that current octg inventory levels in the marketplace will not have a detrimental effect on our shipments assuming our estimate of drilling levels 
imports imports command a significant portion of the domestic octg market 
we believe import levels are affected by  among other things currency exchange rates  overall world wide demand for octg  freight costs  the trade practices of foreign governments and producers  and the presence or absence of antidumping  countervailing duty or other us government orders that raise the cost or impose limits on imports 
according to published industry reports  imports of octg products in comprised an estimated of the total domestic market  compared to in and in since  the us government has been imposing duties on imports of various octg products from argentina  italy  japan  korea and mexico in response to antidumping and countervailing duty cases filed by several us companies 
in june  the itc voted to continue these duties for five more years 

table of contents under the us continued dumping and subsidy offset act cdsoa  tariffs collected on dumped imports are required to be directed to the industries harmed 
these payments are made to cover certain operating expenses and investment in manufacturing facilities 
in september  the world trade organization wto ruled that such payments violate international trade rules 
the us trade representative appealed this ruling  however  the wto upheld the ruling in january tariffs under the cdsoa had a negligible impact on us in we received million in cdsoa payments in we cannot predict the us government s future actions regarding duties and tariffs or any other future actions regarding import duties or other trade restrictions on imports of octg and line pipe products 
we expect to continue to experience high levels of competition from imports 
costs of our products as a manufacturer of tubular steel products  the costs of our products include steel raw material costs  direct and indirect labor  energy costs and other direct and indirect manufacturing costs 
we have followed a strategy of being a low cost  quality producer of energy tubular products by focusing on reducing fixed costs  lowering our variable conversion costs by applying continuous process improvement measures within our manufacturing and management processes  and inventory cost management 
the primary raw material used in our seamless operations is steel scrap  which in represented approximately of cost of goods sold for our seamless products 
at our welded facility  purchased steel coil is the primary raw material  which represented approximately of cost of goods sold for our welded products 
as a result  the steel industry  which is highly cyclical and volatile in nature  can affect our costs both positively and negatively 
various factors  most of which are beyond our control  affect the price of steel scrap and coils 
these factors include supply and demand factors  both domestic and global  freight costs and transportation availability  inventory levels of brokers and distributors  the level of imports and exports  and general economic conditions 
our quarterly average cost per net ton of purchased steel scrap over the past three years was as follows average cost per net ton of purchased steel scrap year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year 
table of contents a number of the above mentioned factors combined to result in significant increases in the cost of steel scrap and hot rolled coils beginning late in the fourth quarter of and continuing into strong us and international economic growth  led by china  significantly increased demand for steel scrap 
demand by foreign countries and the fall in the value of the us dollar have resulted in historically high levels of us exports of steel scrap 
in addition  export restrictions placed on steel scrap by certain foreign countries has affected worldwide supply 
based upon our view of the factors that impact the price of steel scrap  we believe our steel scrap costs will remain near the high levels of the increase in steel scrap costs in also contributed to an increase in hot rolled coil costs used in the manufacturing of our welded tubular products 
also  steel coils are in high demand as a result of strong global economic growth 
us supply has also been affected due to the relatively low level of imports  which has occurred for several reasons  including the low value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies  and the high cost of ocean freight 
in addition  there are steel industry specific factors that have contributed to increased steel coil costs such as rising costs of raw materials used by integrated steel companies 
these factors have contributed to the imposition of surcharges and base price increases from steel suppliers to all steel consuming industries  including the octg industry 
our average purchased hot rolled coil costs increased by per ton over our average purchased hot rolled coil costs increased by per ton over based upon our view of the factors that impact the price of hot rolled coils  we believe our hot rolled coil costs will remain near the high levels of late in addition to significantly higher steel prices  buyers of steel products  including the octg industry  have experienced instances of extended lead times on delivery of products and cancellation of steel purchase orders 
in order to ensure a portion of our expected steel coil needs for the second half of  we entered into a supply agreement at fixed volumes and base prices with our major supplier 
the base amount of this commitment was approximately million 
similarly  we entered into a fixed volume and base price contract with the same supplier for a portion of our estimated requirements for the base amount of the commitment is approximately million  excluding raw material surcharges and extras 
since january the octg industry has been passing the increase in steel costs through to its customers in the form of base price increases as well as surcharges 
we imposed surcharges on our shipments in january through april in the amounts of   and per ton  respectively 
effective with may shipments  our invoices for shipments have reflected one price 
while our customers are currently placing orders at higher prices  thus compensating us for increases in our raw material costs  there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to pay higher prices for our tubular products  and that raw material supply will be consistently available to meet our customer demand 
a decline in demand for our product may result in lower selling prices which could result in an inability to fully recover our investment in inventory 

table of contents the effects of inflation did not have a material effect on our results of operations in the past three years 
restructuring of operations in  we implemented restructuring initiatives involving certain operations of our business 
one initiative was to purchase hot rolled coils rather than manufacture them at our welded tubular operations 
as a result  we discontinued the production of hot rolled coils and closed our melt shop and hot strip mill operations at our welded tubular facilities in wilder  kentucky  and effective march  in addition  we decided to exit the special bar quality business by june   which was operated from our koppel  pennsylvania facility 
consequently  in the first quarter of  we recorded million of restructuring charges  including million resulting primarily from asset impairment losses related to machinery  equipment and related spare parts inventories to be sold 
the restructuring charges included a million write down of special bar quality finished goods inventories that was included in cost of products sold 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information in the first quarter of  we recorded million in additional restructuring charges primarily related to the settlement of an operating contract for million in april in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of additional restructuring charges resulting from an increase in the estimated cancellation costs of operating contracts 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of additional restructuring charges related to the restructuring 
the charges included a million impairment loss on assets held for sale and million primarily related to an increase in the estimate of post closure costs for our closed landfill  net of employee separation accrual reversals 
since our restructuring in  we have conducted our operations solely within one segment 

table of contents results of operations a summary of our results of operations  revenue per ton and tons shipped for the years ended december   and are included in the following table

see note restructuring charges to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations compared to summary net sales for were million compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
operating income for was million compared to an operating loss of million in  which included million and million of restructuring charges  respectively 
net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss for of million  or an loss per diluted share 
included in the results was million of cash receipts from a favorable claim settlement  which reduced the loss by per diluted share 
net sales the increase in net sales in of over was primarily attributable to significant increases in revenue per ton for both our welded and seamless tubular products and a increase in shipments  which included a change in product mix toward higher priced seamless product 
the increase in average revenue per ton was primarily due to price increases resulting from the increase in demand for tubular products as well as the pass through of increased steel costs in the form of surcharges and base price increases 
the increase in shipments was caused by higher consumption of octg products as a result of increased drilling activity during the year 
gross profit loss our gross profit for was million  as compared to a gross loss for of million  an increase of million 
our gross profit percent in was 
gross profit improved over as a result of significant increases in prices as well as higher production and shipment levels  which benefited gross profit and gross profit percent through higher absorption of fixed costs 
generally  we were able to achieve increased pricing during the year in advance of incurring  through cost of sales  the dramatic increases that we experienced throughout the year in raw material costs  particularly  hot rolled coil costs 
our overall gross profit percent began to moderate beginning in the fourth quarter of as peak purchased coil costs  used in manufacturing our welded tubular products  began to be recognized in cost of sales 

table of contents our gross profit percentage by quarter in  and was as follows gross profit loss year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year restructuring charges we recorded million of restructuring charges in related primarily to the settlement of an operating contract that was cancelled in connection with the restructuring of our operations in selling general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in were higher by million compared to  but decreased as a percentage of net sales to in from in decreases experienced in discretionary spending and product claims were more than offset by million of accruals for profit sharing and incentive plans  as well as increases in professional fees pertaining to sarbanes oxley requirements in results of operations compared to summary net sales for were million compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the operating loss for was million compared to an operating loss of million in  which included million of restructuring charges 
net loss for was million  or an loss per diluted share  compared to a net loss for of million  or a loss of per diluted share 
included in the results was million of cash receipts from a favorable claim settlement  which reduced the loss by per diluted share 
results for included million of restructuring charges  which increased the loss by per diluted share 

table of contents net sales our net sales in increased over primarily as a result of an increase in both our welded and seamless tubular product shipments 
the increase in shipments was caused by higher consumption of octg products in light of increased drilling activity in changes in our average revenue per ton were not significant and primarily price driven 
prices in were suppressed as us and foreign producers competed for the increase in energy tubular product demand 
gross loss our gross loss was reduced by million from due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  a higher absorption of fixed costs due to the significantly higher operating levels in  lower variable conversion costs per ton  lower fixed costs  and increased revenue per ton for welded products 
in  we implemented management process changes to reduce spending and improve prime yield and productivity measures throughout all of our major operations 
as a result of these efforts  we estimate that we reduced our variable conversion costs in our major operations by to  depending on the operation 
we also reduced our manufacturing fixed costs in due to lower wage and fringe costs associated with a reduction in salaried personnel as well as other cost reduction measures 
depreciation expense declined by million from as a result of the machinery and equipment placed in service in for the opening of our seamless operations becoming fully depreciated 
these factors were partially offset by higher purchased steel scrap and coil costs over selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in were lower by million compared to contributing factors included a reduction in wages and fringe costs associated with a reduction in salaried personnel and a decrease in discretionary spending  primarily pertaining to professional consulting fees for various project work 
investment income  interest expense  other  net our net investment income was million in  compared to a loss of million in and income of million in investment income increased in over as a result of an increase in average invested cash balances 
investment income before impairment losses decreased in compared to because of lower invested balances as we liquidated our investments to pay down our senior notes and fund operating losses 
investment income was also lower due to declining interest rates paid on investments 
impairment losses on long term investments were million and million in and  respectively 

table of contents during  and  we reduced our interest expense by paying down our revolving credit facility in and redeeming million and million in principal of our senior secured notes in july and in july  respectively 
the pay off of the revolving credit facility in was funded from operations 
the senior note retirements in were funded from existing cash and investment balances and borrowings under our credit facility 
other income  net for includes a million gain on the sale of land held as investment property and losses on the disposal of equipment 
other income  net for and includes million and million  respectively  of cash receipts from favorable claim settlements with electrode suppliers relating to purchases in prior years 
income taxes income tax expense for is computed at a combined federal and state effective tax rate of approximately as a result of the utilization of regular tax net operating loss carryforwards 
see liquidity and capital resources other for further discussion regarding our net operating loss carryforwards 
we exhausted our federal income tax refund capability in  and accordingly  tax benefits from operating losses are offset by valuation allowances  resulting in no net federal tax benefit being recorded for losses in and the million tax benefit recorded in resulted from reclassifying to income the deferred tax benefits related to our long term investments that were sold in the million tax benefit recorded in resulted primarily from refund claims filed in connection with the then newly enacted federal income tax law changes 
liquidity and capital resources overview our principal sources of liquidity have historically included cash flow from operating activities  our revolving credit facility and other sources of financing through the capital markets 
our business is highly cyclical in nature  and therefore our cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly 
for example  cash flows from operating activities provided million in  however  they used million and million in and  respectively 
we consider working capital items such as accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and accrued liabilities as critical components to managing our liquidity 
we currently depend on cash flows from operations and our credit facility to fund our working capital needs 
our capital expenditures have totaled million over the past three years and have not been a significant liquidity requirement in any one year 
we have limited our capital spending in the past three years primarily to non discretionary spending 
our capital spending will be adjusted as market conditions and financial results allow 

table of contents in october  we entered into a contract to sell a significant portion of our assets held for sale 
in accordance with the contract  payments of million were received in in the past three years  we have spent to retire the remaining principal portion of our senior secured notes 
we funded these retirements principally from existing cash and investment balances as well as borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
during we paid off our revolving credit facility and we received million in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
based upon our current market outlook  we believe income from operations will improve in due to increased revenues  resulting from both increased shipments and pricing  as well as further improvements in our conversion costs 
as such  we believe cash flows from operations  together with our credit facility and other sources  including the capital markets  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
working capital working capital at december  was million  an increase of million from the million at december   and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december  was to compared to to at december  increases in our cash and equivalents balances and the elimination of all credit facility loans accounted for million of the increase in working capital 
the remaining working capital increase of million was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventories in excess of increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  resulting from a significant increase in business activity  product pricing and higher steel raw material costs 
at december  we had cash and equivalents totaling million compared to cash and equivalents of million at december  there were no borrowings on our credit facility at december  as compared to borrowings of million at december  
table of contents operating cash flows cash provided by operating activities in was million 
we had operating income of million  which included depreciation and amortization charges of million 
operating cash flows supported a million net increase in our operating assets and liabilities 
major components of the changes in our operating assets and liabilities included a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventories  partially offset by increases of million  million and million in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue  respectively 
the increase in our accounts receivable balance was primarily the result of increased pricing  as well as an increase in shipment levels 
our investment in inventory increased because of higher quantities of our seamless products on hand to meet increased shipment levels as well as an overall increase in the steel raw material costs component of inventory  particularly in our welded operations 
higher steel raw material costs also contributed to the increase in our accounts payable 
accrued liabilities increased million as a result of accruals for hourly and salaried profit sharing and incentive plans at december  most of our profit sharing and incentive plans are based on annual results  and therefore will not be paid until the first quarter of the increase in deferred revenue resulted from significantly increased selling prices and a higher level of business activity 
restructuring liabilities decreased million primarily as a result of a contract settlement payment 
cash used by operating activities in was million 
this use of cash was primarily the result of an operating loss of million  which included depreciation and amortization charges of million 
in addition  changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in a use of cash of million in major components of these changes included a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventories  partially offset by increases of million and million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  respectively 
the increase in our accounts receivable balance was the result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of as compared to sales in the fourth quarter of the increase in inventories and accounts payable was the result of increased business levels and incremental investments made in anticipation of raw material cost increases 
accrued liabilities increased principally as the result of a million increase in deferred revenue resulting from the higher level of business activity 
we made million in interest payments in  or million less than we paid in  due to the payoff of our senior secured notes in operating cash flows in included cash receipts of million related to antitrust litigation against manufacturers of graphite electrodes used in the steel making process 
cash used by operating activities in was million 
this use of cash was primarily the result of an operating loss of million  which included depreciation and amortization charges of million 
changes in our operating assets and liabilities generated million in cash in major components of these changes in included a decrease in accounts receivable and accounts payable of million and million  respectively  resulting primarily from a decline in business activity in also  we made million in interest payments in 
table of contents investing cash flows cash flows from investing activities were million in  million in and million in proceeds from sales of assets held for sale and long term investments were used for general corporate purposes 
we made capital investments of million in  million in and million in these capital expenditures were primarily related to maintenance and improvements to our tubular manufacturing facilities 
we currently estimate that our capital spending in will be approximately million  the majority of which is estimated for maintenance and improvement projects 
our sources of funding for capital expenditures include available cash on hand  cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under our credit facility 
the amount ultimately spent will depend upon the availability of these resources 
financing cash flows we paid off all existing loans under our credit facility during and had no outstanding loans under the facility as of december  we also benefited from the increase in the value of our stock in as participants in our benefit plans exercised stock options which generated cash of million 
in the second quarter of we redeemed the remaining million of our outstanding senior secured notes that were due on july  the notes were redeemed at par plus accrued interest and were funded from existing cash balances and borrowings under our credit facility 
on july   we redeemed million in principal amount of our senior secured notes at par plus accrued interest using existing cash balances 
long term debt maturities for each of the next five years are less than million 
in july we filed a universal shelf registration statement for the issuance and sale from time to time to the public of up to million in securities  including debt  preferred stock  common stock and warrants 
the shelf registration was declared effective by the sec in september we have not sold any securities pursuant to the shelf registration 
we believe the shelf registration affords us the financial flexibility to react to future opportunities in the market 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for more information on the credit facility and shelf registration 

table of contents at december   we had regular tax net operating loss carryforwards which will fully eliminate the regular tax liability on approximately million of future regular taxable income 
while we may have alternative minimum tax amt liability  we also have amt net operating loss carryforwards which will eliminate of the amt liability on approximately million of future amt income 
while future tax provisions will depend in part on our ongoing assessment of our future ability to utilize our tax benefits  we expect that the tax provisions that we record on approximately the next million in pre tax income will be substantially less than the amounts at full statutory rates 
you should read note to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our federal tax status 
contractual obligations and other cash requirements the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from contractual obligations and our commercial commitments under our revolving credit facility 
except for the purchase obligations noted in footnote a below  we have not included information on our recurring purchases of materials for use in our manufacturing operations 
these amounts closely reflect our levels of production and are not long term in nature less than three months 
certain obligations are described more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period less than more than in thousands total year years years years long term debt restructuring liabilities employee benefit plans purchase obligations a operating leases total a the company has a purchase obligation for steel coils for of approximately million  excluding raw material surcharges and extras 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents we have a million revolving credit facility that expires in march as of december   we had no loans outstanding under the credit facility 
we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million  reducing the amount of funds available under the credit facility to approximately million as of december  the facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our inventories  accounts receivable and property  plant and equipment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we currently purchase electricity for our seamless facilities in pennsylvania pursuant to long term contracts 
amounts paid under these contracts are not included in the table because they can vary significantly based on the level of our operations 
we paid million  million and million to the electricity providers of these facilities in  and  respectively 
we are subject to various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business with respect to environmental matters  workers compensation  health care and product liability each of which is self insured to certain levels as well as commercial and other matters 
we accrue for the cost of such matters when the incurrence of such costs is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in we decreased our reserves for warranty claims by million as new claims and changes in estimates of existing claims of million were offset by million of settlements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of product warranty claims 
while the ultimate amount and timing of payment for loss contingencies can be difficult to determine  we do not believe that such amounts and the timing of payment will result in a material adverse affect on our cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of accrued liabilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer claims  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  long lived assets  assets held for sale  income taxes  product liability  workers compensation claims  restructuring liabilities  environmental contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition product revenues are recognized as sales when revenue is earned and is realized or realizable 
this includes satisfying the following criteria the arrangement with the customer is evident  usually through the receipt of a purchase order  the sales price is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  the risk of loss has been passed to the customer  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues are also recognized when  at the customer s request  the goods are set aside in storage at the company s facilities and paid for in full 
freight and shipping billed to customers is included in net sales  and the cost of freight and shipping is included in cost of products sold 
accounts receivable allowances we evaluate the collectibility of our receivables based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze our customer accounts and  when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
we also maintain a reserve for customer claims for returns of defective materials 
this reserve is recorded as a percentage of sales and estimated based upon historical experience 
the adequacy of reserve estimates is periodically reviewed by comparison to actual experience 
claims in any future period could differ from our estimates and impact the net sales we report 
inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market and regularly review the book value to determine if items are properly valued 
we record adjustments to the value of our inventory based on sales and production forecasts 
these adjustments are estimates  which can vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual amounts if future costs or levels of business activity differ from our expectations 
generally  we do not experience issues with slow moving or obsolete inventory due to the nature of our products 
if we are not able to achieve our expectations of the net realizable value of the inventory at its current value  we would have to adjust our reserves accordingly 

table of contents long lived asset impairment we evaluate our long lived assets used in operations  consisting of property  plant and equipment  when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic factors are present 
when such indicators of impairment exist  an evaluation is performed to determine whether the carrying value of an asset is impaired based on a comparison to the undiscounted estimated future cash flows from the asset 
the evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events 
assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when we approve the plan to sell  and thereafter while the asset is held for sale 
estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors  we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded 
employee benefits plans we record liabilities and expense for deferred compensation agreements  salary continuation agreements sca and postretirement health benefit costs based on actuarial valuations 
all benefits paid under the agreements are unfunded and benefits are paid from operating cash flows 
the net present value of the benefits provided under the deferred compensation agreements were accrued over the period of the employee s active employment from the time the contract was signed to the employee s retirement date using a discount rate of eleven percent  which approximated our incremental borrowing rate at that time 
inherent in the valuations for the sca and postretirement health benefits are key assumptions including assumptions about discount rates 
these assumptions are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
to develop our discount rate  we considered the available yields on high quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations 
we used discount rates of and to determine the sca and postretirement health benefit liability as of december  and  respectively 
the decline in the discount rate used to estimate the sca and postretirement health benefit liability is a result of declining interest rates in the united states 
changes in the related sca and postretirement health benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions  primarily changes in the discount rate 
restructuring reserves our restructuring reserves reflect many estimates  including those pertaining to settlements of contractual obligations and environmental remediation obligations 
we reassess the reserve requirements for completing the restructuring program at the end of each reporting period 
actual experience has been and may continue to be different from these estimates 
additional charges may be required in the future if the estimates of environmental remediation costs differ from our estimates 
refer to notes and to our consolidated financial statements for more information related to restructuring reserves and associated environmental reserves 

table of contents reserves for contingencies we have other potential exposures  such as workers compensation claims  environmental claims  product liability  litigation and recoverability of deferred income taxes 
establishing loss reserves or valuation allowances for these matters requires us to estimate and make judgments with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we establish accruals for these exposures  however  if our exposure exceeds our estimates  we could be required to record additional charges
