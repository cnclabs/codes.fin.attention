item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion together with the financial statements  including the related notes and the other financial information in this form k 
executive overview we are a leading developer  owner and operator of branded gaming facilities and related lodging and entertainment facilities in regional markets in the united states and internationally 
we continue to investigate developing new locations  purchasing existing operations and expanding our current properties 
these activities require capital intensive investments that have long term return potential 
we have intentionally sought geographic diversity to limit the risks caused by weather  regional economic difficulties  and local gaming authorities and regulations 
we currently operate casinos in mississippi  louisiana  missouri  iowa  colorado and freeport  grand bahamas island 
we operate a harness racing track in florida 
additionally  we have a controlling interest in casino investments in dudley  wolverhampton and walsall  england  each of which is operated by the minority owners 
the following table reflects our consolidated net revenues and operating income by state isle of capri casinos  inc 
consolidated statements of operations in thousands fiscal year ended april  april  variance variance net revenues mississippi louisiana missouri iowa colorado international corporate and other total net revenues operating income mississippi lousiana missouri iowa colorado international corporate and other operating income in mississippi  our four operations contributed million or of our net revenues during the fiscal year ended april  due primarily to construction disruption during our biloxi hotel construction and increasingly competitive environments in our vicksburg and lula markets  our mississippi net revenues declined million 
our decline in revenue coupled with increased marketing  employee benefits  maintenance  land rent and depreciation  resulted in a corresponding decline in operating income of million 
we expect to complete the biloxi hotel expansion by mid summer of  prior to the expected opening of an additional branded competitor in the market in the fall of additionally  we expect to close the existing biloxi casino barge for approximately two weeks during early december to install our new  larger casino barge  which will feature significantly expanded gaming space  new entertainment venues  new restaurants and other amenities 
we expect that our expansion and the addition of a new branded competitor will have a positive impact on the biloxi market 
in louisiana  our two properties contributed million or of our net revenues during the fiscal year ended april  net revenues increased million due to the positive results in lake charles related to the renovation and expansion of its grand palais casino partially offset by a decline in bossier city related to increasing competitive pressures in that market 
operating income in louisiana also increased million as labor and other cost reduction programs implemented in bossier city coupled with revenue increases at lake charles 
an additional competitor entered the lake charles market in late may we expect this entrant will cause the market to grow but at the same time to have a negative impact on existing market participants 
the bossier city market is highly competitive and is facing increased competition from expansion of native american gaming in oklahoma 
in missouri  our two properties contributed million or of our net revenues during the fiscal year ended april  net revenues increased million while operating income increased million as a result of kansas city s previous casino expansion and aggressive marketing as well as boonville s continuing efforts to maximize its full potential 
beginning in may  there were disruptions to traffic flow at the kansas city property as the paseo bridge on interstate will be closed for repairs for four to seven months and will likely result in reduction of gaming revenues during this period 
in iowa  our three casinos contributed million or of our net revenues during the fiscal year ended april  net revenues increased by million and operating income increased by million 
a decrease in depreciation from the davenport property  due to an extension of the hotel s useful life  was substantially offset by a charge to increase operating lease expense and a increase in the iowa gaming tax rates 
the charge was due to the change in the recognition of long term lease costs 
the tax rates became effective july  in fiscal the quad city properties have faced increasing competition from casinos in the chicagoland market as those operators refine their product and service offerings 
in colorado  our two black hawk properties contributed million or of our net revenues during the fiscal year ended april  during fiscal  construction at our black hawk properties  which significantly reduced parking for the colorado central station black hawk and restricted access to the street entrances to both black hawk casinos  adversely impacted net revenues and operating income by million and million  respectively 
in february we opened new parking spaces and the construction disruption began to decline 
by mid june  we completed the casino expansions at both casinos  a new restaurant  the skywalks connecting the casinos to the new garage and a total of new parking spaces thus ending the most disruptive phase of our black hawk expansion projects 
construction of the new room colorado central station hotel is currently ahead of schedule and the hotel is expected to open near the end of calendar construction on the extension of main street to colorado route  temporarily delayed by engineering problems  has now resumed 
completion is expected in the spring of in our international locations  we experienced an increase in net revenues due to comparison to a portion year blue chip opened is mid november and isle our lucaya opened in mid december and operating income due to the recording of million of business interruption proceeds at isle our lucaya  related to closings caused by hurricane frances in the second quarter of fiscal both our international locations continue to experience growing pains and are expected to generate negative operating income with an improving trend 
in corporate and other  our new development expenses increased to million for the fiscal year ended april   up from million for the same period in the previous fiscal year 
this is primarily due to our continuing development efforts in the uk  florida  waterloo and other initial investments to proposed future projects 
in november  voters in the state of florida voted to amend the state s constitution to allow the voters of miami dade and broward counties broward county is the location of the pompano park racetrack to decide whether to approve slot machines in racetracks and jai alai frontons in their respective counties 
broward county voters passed their local referendum and dade county voters rejected their referendum in march enabling gaming legislation was not passed in the current session of the florida legislature despite the constitutional requirement that such legislation be in effect by july  along with the other broward county pari mutuels  we filed a lawsuit seeking authority to proceed with the development of slot machine facilities despite the absence of enabling legislation 
on june   the circuit court judge issued a decision in favor of the pari mutuel facilities  which decision will be appealed 
accordingly  the regulation and timing of installation and operation of slot machines has not been finally determined 
we remain committed to our development project in the uk to build a casino in coventry  however  legislation enacted in april limits the number of regional casinos to one 
the number may be increased only through additional legislation 
we have obtained all necessary gaming licenses to open a casino at the ricoh arena coventry in the summer of under the gaming act of we believe we are well positioned to develop a regional casino in coventry should we be awarded a regional casino license 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles that require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management identifies critical accounting estimates as those that require the use of assumptions about matters that are inherently and highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  those estimates where  had we chosen different estimates or assumptions  the resulting differences would have had a material impact on our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations  and those estimates that  if they were to change from period to period  likely would result in a material impact on our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
based upon management s discussion of the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  we believe the following accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
goodwill and other intangible assets at april   we had goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives of million  representing of total assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the company s goodwill and intangible assets below its carrying value 
we completed our annual impairment test as required under sfas in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that  other than the goodwill associated with our colorado grande cripple creek casino  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets were not impaired 
a charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter for the impairment of colorado grande cripple creek s remaining goodwill 
for properties with goodwill and or other intangible assets with indefinite lives  this test requires the comparison of the implied fair value of each property to carrying value 
the implied fair value includes estimates of future cash flows that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and represent our best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
changes in estimates or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results 
property and equipment at april   we had property and equipment of  billion  representing of total assets 
we capitalize the cost of property and equipment 
maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred 
costs incurred in connection with the company s all properties other capital improvements  program  as detailed in the liquidity and capital resources section below  include individual capital expenditures related to the purchase of furniture and equipment and to the upgrade of hotel rooms  restaurants and other areas of our properties 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
future events such as property expansions  new competition and new regulations could result in a change in the manner in which we are using certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets 
we evaluate long lived assets for impairment using statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment loss for these assets 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 
self insurance liabilities we are self funded up to a maximum amount per claim for our employee related health care benefits program  workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance 
claims in excess of this maximum are fully insured through a stop loss insurance policy 
we accrue for these liabilities based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we rely on independent consultants to assist in the determination of estimated accruals 
while the total cost of claims incurred depends on future developments  such as increases in health care costs  in our opinion  recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments 
income tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires that we recognize a current tax asset or liability for the estimated taxes payable or refundable based upon application of the enacted tax rates to taxable income in the current year 
additionally  we are required to recognize a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences 
temporary differences occur when differences arise between a the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and b the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in financial statements 
sfas also requires that any deferred tax asset recognized must be reduced by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits that  in our judgment and based upon available evidence  may not be realizable 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the need for a valuation allowance  are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjusted if necessary 
we use forecasted future operating results and consider enacted tax laws and rates in determining if the valuation allowance is sufficient 
we operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions and are therefore subject to varying tax laws and potential audits  which could impact our assessments and estimates 
contingencies we are involved in various legal proceedings and have identified certain loss contingencies 
we record liabilities related to these contingencies when it is determined that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
these assessments are based on our knowledge and experience as well as the advice of legal counsel regarding current and past events 
any such estimates are also subject to future events  court rulings  negotiations between the parties and other uncertainties 
if an actual loss differs from our estimate  or the actual outcome of any of the legal proceedings differs from expectations  operating results could be impacted 
we routinely face challenges from federal and other tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we record tax accruals for probable exposures associated with the various filing positions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
slot club awards we reward our slot customers for their loyalty based on the dollar amount of play on slot machines 
we accrue for these slot club awards based on an estimate of the value of the outstanding awards utilizing the age and prior history of redemptions 
future events such as a change in our marketing strategy or new competition could result in a change in the value of the awards

we continued to operate the casino until september   when the purchaser s designated gaming operator received regulatory approval 
results also include the colorado central station black hawk subsequent to its acquisition on april  fiscal results have been reclassified to reflect the colorado grande cripple creek as discontinued operations 
we believe that our historical results of operations may not be indicative of our future results of operations because of the substantial present and expected future increase in competition for gaming customers in each of our markets  as new gaming facilities open and existing gaming facilities expand or enhance their facilities 
we believe that our operating results are materially affected by the economy and weather 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  gross revenues for the fiscal year ended april  were billion  which included billion of casino revenue  million of room revenue  million of pari mutuel commissions  million of food and beverage revenue and million of other revenue

likewise  casino revenues increased at the isle lake charles resulting from the expansion and renovation of the grand palais 
the addition of the isle our lucaya and the blue chip dudley also increased casino revenues as these properties opened in the third quarter of fiscal these increases were offset by the sale of the lady luck las vegas 
in colorado  casino revenues declined as the isle black hawk and the colorado central station black hawk have been affected by construction disruption 
we also faced decreases in casino revenues at the isle biloxi because of construction and the aftermath of hurricane ivan

these allowances increased by in fiscal year as we increased our direct mail efforts to promote play 
casino operating expenses increased over fiscal year these expenses are primarily comprised of salaries  wages and benefits and other operating expenses of the casinos 
the increase in casino operating expenses is attributable to the additions of the isle our lucaya and blue chip 
isle our lucaya incurred casino operating expenses during the time the property was closed in the aftermath of last year s hurricanes 
these increases are partially offset by the discontinuation of gaming operations at the lady luck las vegas  following the finalization of the property s sale  and a decrease in salaries  wages  taxes and benefits at the isle bossier city due to cost controls 
state and local gaming taxes increased by compared to fiscal year effective july   we were subject to an additional assessment of of gross gaming revenues in iowa due to a tax increase enacted in that state

food and beverage expenses increased over fiscal year food and beverage expenses as a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues increased from for the fiscal year ended april   to for the fiscal year ended april  these expenses consist primarily of the cost of goods sold  salaries  wages and benefits and other operating expenses of these departments

marine and facilities expenses increased compared to fiscal year these expenses include salaries  wages and benefits of the marine and facilities departments  operating expenses of the marine crews  insurance  maintenance of public areas  housekeeping and general maintenance of the riverboats and pavilions

administrative expenses have increased over fiscal year these expenses include administration and human resource department expenses  rent  new development activities  professional fees and property taxes

we also increased our development and investment activities domestically and in the uk 
in florida  we supported the successful campaign to pass a constitutional amendment that allows the voters of miami dade and broward counties to decide whether to approve slot machines in racetracks and jai alai facilities in their respective counties 
these increases were partially offset by finalization of the sale and discontinuation of all operations at the lady luck las vegas and savings from combining some administrative functions of our the isle bettendorf and the rhythm city davenport properties 
depreciation expense increased by compared to fiscal year depreciation has increased as a result of the company s capital expansion programs 
the increase was primarily due to a one time charge for additional depreciation expense of million related to a reclassification of certain land improvements that were improperly classified as land at the time of the conversion of the company s manual system to a computerized asset tracking system in fiscal  identified in the second fiscal quarter of  as well as the capital additions at the isle biloxi  isle bossier city  the isle lake charles and the isle kansas city

we also incurred a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million in fiscal related to the amendment of our million senior subordinated notes on march  these charges included early payment premiums as well as the write off of debt acquisition costs 
net interest expense decreased compared with fiscal year this is primarily attributable to the lower average balances outstanding 
net interest also excludes capitalized interest of million for the fiscal year ended april   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended april  the increase in capitalized interest results from the expansion projects at the isle biloxi and in black hawk 
the increase is partially offset by the completion of the expansion projects at the isle bossier city 
our effective tax rate from continuing operations was for the fiscal year ended april   compared to for fiscal year ended april   which  in each case  excludes an unrelated party s portion of the colorado central station black hawk income taxes 
the increase in the rate for fiscal is a result of the effect of non deductible permanent items on earnings  the impact of not benefiting from a portion of the current operating losses of the company s interests in the uk and state income taxes 
also in the second fiscal quarter ended  the internal revenue service concluded a federal tax examination covering four tax years without significant adjustments and provided administrative guidance on certain other tax matters for other open years 
as a result  we analyzed our tax accruals and reduced income tax expense by approximately million for previously accrued income tax liabilities 
this had the effect of reducing our effective tax rate to from continuing operations  excluding the minority interest s portion of the colorado central station black hawk income taxes 
excluding the impact of these adjustments  our fiscal year effective rate from continuing operations would have been  excluding the minority interest s portion of the colorado central station black hawk income taxes

in colorado  a full year contribution by the colorado central station black hawk and the colorado grande cripple creek added an additional million in casino revenue 
additionally  isle black hawk s casino revenue increased million 
we were pleased when a statewide referendum that would have allowed video lottery terminals in all of the state s horse racing tracks was defeated 
the gains in colorado were partially offset by the closing and subsequent sale of the isle s tunica and las vegas locations 
because of construction disruptions and increase in the number of competitors  the isle bossier city saw casino revenue decrease by 
room revenue decreased compared to prior year 
the decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease of  hotel rooms resulting from the sale of the isle tunica and the lady luck las vegas 
the decrease was partially offset by increased room revenue at the isle bossier city due to the completion of its room hotel expansion in january of pari mutuel revenue earned at pompano park in florida decreased by 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the general decrease of onsite wagering on horse races 
additionally  the park did not hold live races in july  august or september of to increase the purse pool for later races  thereby decreasing the number of live race days in fiscal year compared to fiscal year pompano park plans to hold live races in july  august and september of food and beverage revenue increased from year to year

the system being developed under the joint venture was substantially past due and we believed it was probable that we would not recover our investment

this includes not only the improvements at isle biloxi and isle bossier city but also the company wide project to update its slot product

remaining amounts were used for general corporate purposes 
our effective tax rate from continuing operations was for the fiscal year ended april  as compared to for the fiscal year ended april   which  in each case  excludes an unrelated party s portion of the colorado central station black hawk income taxes

liquidity and capital resources at april   we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million compared to million in cash and cash equivalents at april   the end of our last fiscal year 
of this million increase  is an increase in cash and cash equivalents and is the net result of million net cash provided by operating activities  million net cash used in investing activities  million net cash provided by financing activities and million increase in cash from the effect of foreign currency exchange rates

in may  the company signed a management agreement with resort developer eighth wonder to manage the casino included in eighth wonder s proposal for a new integrated resort complex in singapore 
in the first quarter fiscal  the company paid eighth wonder million pursuant to the terms of this agreement 
on march   we announced that we had been selected by the illinois gaming board as the successful bidder in a federal bankruptcy court auction for the th illinois gaming license conducted pursuant to an agreement approved by  among other parties  the illinois attorney general 
we bid million to acquire by merger the stock of a company in bankruptcy that owns the license 
our bid currently expires on august   which date has been extended monthly by us several times 
if this merger is completed  we expect to spend approximately million in addition to amounts already expended at the site in rosemont  illinois to construct a single level   square foot casino with  gaming positions  restaurants  an entertainment venue and retail space 
we plan to finance the rosemont  illinois project through equity contributions from us and from a limited number of individual investors  who in the aggregate will own as required by illinois law  in an amount sufficient to allow non recourse financing for the remainder of the cash needed to complete the project 
the federal bankruptcy court has confirmed the plan of reorganization pursuant to which the merger would be consummated 
the merger remains subject to certain conditions  including a finding of suitability and final approval by the illinois gaming board as well as certain other conditions 
in addition  the illinois attorney general has raised issues with regard to the appropriateness of the village of rosemont as a host community and the illinois gaming board s selection of our bid 
the illinois gaming board working with the illinois attorney general has also resumed an administrative proceeding seeking to revoke the gaming license from our proposed merger partner  which if successful may adversely impact our ability to operate a gaming facility in the village of rosemont 
the illinois attorney general has also filed a suit against the illinois gaming board seeking to enjoin the board from conducting a suitability investigation of us in connection with the merger provided for under the plan of reorganization which suitability review has been suspended by the illinois gaming board pending the completion of the aforementioned revocation proceeding 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the governor of illinois appointed a new gaming board 
one of the first acts by the new board was to authorize the reinstatement of the proceeding to rescind the license from the current owner 
for the reasons set forth above  among others  we believe that our ability to obtain the gaming license and open a gaming facility in rosemont has been subjected to added uncertainty 
the illinois supreme court has also agreed to review certain challenges to amendments to the illinois riverboat gambling act relating to the proposed relocation of the th license 
there can be no assurance that the foregoing conditions will be satisfied or that we will ultimately acquire the license 
additionally  because illinois limits the number of gaming licenses  each license has intrinsic value 
therefore  this license is considered an intangible asset 
as such  the full cost of the license and all associated costs were originally capitalized in the amount of million 
due to the continuing uncertainty with respect to this matter  we have recorded a valuation charge for the full amount expended at april  we do not anticipate any significant expenditures related to the monthly renewal 
on october   we loaned million to florida gaming corporation florida gaming 
interest accrues on the unpaid principal balance of the loan at an annual rate of and is paid in arrears on the first day of each fiscal quarter 
the loan is secured by a pledge of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of florida gaming centers  inc fgc  a wholly owned subsidiary of florida gaming 
the entire unpaid principal amount of the loan and unpaid interest thereon is payable on the earlier of the sale of all or any material portion of the assets of  or all or any substantial equity interest in fgc  or december  concurrently with the loan  florida gaming and fgc entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which florida gaming and fgc gave us exclusive negotiating rights with respect to the acquisition of all or substantially all of fgc s miami jai alai business for a period ending no later than december  in november  voters in the state of florida voted to amend the state s constitution to allow the voters of miami dade and broward counties broward county is the location of the pompano park racetrack to decide whether to approve slot machines in racetracks and jai alai frontons in their respective counties 
broward county voters passed their local referendum and dade county voters rejected their referendum in march enabling gaming legislation was not passed in the current session of the florida legislature despite the constitutional requirement that such legislation be in effect by july  along with the other broward county pari mutuels  we filed a lawsuit seeking authority to proceed with the development of slot machine facilities despite the absence of enabling legislation 
on june   the circuit court judge issued a decision in favor of the pari mutuel facilities  which decision will be appealed 
accordingly  the regulation and timing of installation and operation of slot machines has not been finally determined 
should we be successful  we plan to construct a new facility in two phases 
phase i will include an expansion of the existing facility to accommodate  to  additional slots  at a cost of approximately million to be completed in approximately nine to twelve months from project start 
phase ii  subject to timing and circumstances of phase i  will include an additional facility expansion and an additional  slots at a planned cost of approximately million 
in january  we announced plans to deploy the igt advantage casino system 
the total cost of the project is expected to be approximately million  of which million is included in the colorado central station black hawk property expansion project discussed above 
we have also spent million at the isle biloxi  the isle vicksburg  the isle lula  the isle natchez and another property to be determined  leaving a remaining budget of million 
this will allow our properties to experience product upgrades to operate more competitively within their markets 
our slot improvement initiative also includes an increased ticket in ticket out slot product offering 
we expense all developmental costs until we determine that ultimate licensure and operation is deemed probable 
at that time  we evaluate the applicable costs and capitalize if appropriate 
all of our development plans are subject to obtaining permits  licenses and approvals from appropriate regulatory and other agencies and  in certain circumstances  negotiating acceptable leases 
in addition  many of the plans are preliminary  subject to continuing refinement or otherwise subject to change 
financing activities during the twelve month period ended april   we had net sources of cash of million primarily in the following financing activities we received proceeds from the issuance of new debt of million 
we made net borrowings under the isle black hawk s credit facility of million 
we made borrowings under blue chip s credit facility of million 
we made principal payments on our senior secured credit facility and other debt of million 
we purchased  shares of our common stock at a total cost of million 
we made cash distributions to a minority partner totaling million 
we paid million in costs related to the refinancing of our senior secured credit facility 
on february   we refinanced our senior secured credit facility 
our new senior secured facility provides for a million revolving credit facility maturing on february  and a million term loan facility maturing on february  or at our option  february  if we elect to refinance our existing senior subordinated notes currently due march with an additional million delayed draw term loan available until august  at our mutual discretion with the lead arranger  we may increase the revolver and or term loan  in an aggregate amount up to million  subject to certain conditions 
the term loans are payable in quarterly installments beginning on march  and ending on february  unless extended as described above 
the revolving credit facility may bear interest at the higher of in excess of the federal funds effective rate or the rate that the bank group announces from time to time as its prime lending rate plus an applicable margin of up to or a rate tied to a libor rate plus an applicable margin of up to 
the term loan may bear interest at the higher of in excess of the federal funds effective rate or the rate that the bank group announces from time to time as its prime lending rate plus an applicable margin of up to or a rate tied to a libor rate plus an applicable margin of 
the proceeds from the refinancing were used to pay down the existing senior secured credit facility term loan  of which million in principal and million in accrued interest were outstanding as of february  the remainder of the undrawn facility will be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  permitted acquisitions  capital expenditures and investments 
pursuant to the refinancing  we recognized a loss before income taxes on early extinguishment of debt of million  due to the write off of previously deferred financing costs related to our existing senior secured credit facility 
the costs associated with the new senior secured credit facility have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the new facility 
our senior secured credit facility  among other things  limits our ability to borrow money  make capital expenditures  use assets as security in other transactions  make restricted payments or restricted investments  incur contingent obligations  sell assets and enter into leases and transactions with affiliates 
in addition  our credit facility requires us to meet certain financial ratios and tests  including a minimum consolidated ebitda test  a maximum consolidated total leverage test  a maximum consolidated senior leverage test  and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
as of april   we had million of capacity under lines of credit and available term debt consisting of million in unused credit capacity under the revolving loan commitment on our senior secured credit facility  million of unused credit capacity under the isle black hawk s senior secured credit facility limited to use by the isle black hawk and million of available credit under other lines of credit 
the revolving loan commitment is a variable rate instrument based on  at our option  libor or our lender s prime rate plus the applicable interest rate spread  and is effective through february our lines of credit are also at variable rates based on our lender s prime rate and are subject to annual renewal 
there is no assurance that these sources will in fact provide adequate funding for the expenditures described above or that planned capital investments will be sufficient to allow us to remain competitive in our existing markets 
during the year  we modified the covenants related to the isle black hawk senior credit facility to align the covenants with the financial impact of projected effects of construction on those facilities 
we are in compliance with all covenants contained in our senior and subordinated debt instruments as of april  if we do not maintain compliance with these covenants  the lenders under the black hawk senior secured credit facility have the option in some cases  after the expiration of contractual grace periods  but not the obligation  to demand immediate repayment of all or any portion of the obligations outstanding under the facility 
any significant deterioration of earnings could affect certain of our covenants 
adverse changes in our credit rating or stock price would not impact our borrowing costs or covenant compliance under existing debt instruments 
future events  such as a significant increase in interest rates can be expected to increase our costs of borrowing under our black hawk senior secured credit facility 
the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes and our senior subordinated notes limit  among other things  our ability to borrow money  create liens  make restricted payments and sell assets 
we anticipate being in compliance with our debt covenants during fiscal year we are highly leveraged and may be unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms 
as a result  limitations on our capital resources could delay or cause us to abandon certain plans for capital improvements at our existing properties and or development of new properties 
we will continue to evaluate our planned capital expenditures at each of our existing locations in light of the operating performance of the facilities at such locations

recently issued accounting standards on december   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows sfas 
generally  the accounting method required by sfas r is similar to the accounting method required by sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair market values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period of our first fiscal year that begins on or after june  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we are required to adopt sfas r on may   but are continuing to evaluate our option to early adopt 
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate for the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we are currently evaluating the two recognition methods available under sfas r to determine which method we will adopt 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method is expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the ongoing impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  including interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our senior secured credit facility and the isle black hawk senior secured credit facility 
isle black hawk senior secured credit facility the isle black hawk has entered into four interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of million or of its variable rate term debt outstanding under the isle black hawk s senior secured credit facility as of april  the swap agreements effectively convert portions of its variable rate debt to a fixed rate basis until the fourth fiscal quarter of  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense 
these interest rate swap agreements terminate as follows million in each of fiscal and we evaluate the effectiveness of these hedged transactions on a quarterly basis 
we found no portion of the hedging instruments to be ineffective during the quarter ended april  accordingly  no gains or losses have been recognized on these cash flow hedges 
the following table provides information at april  about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
interest rate sensitivity principal notional amount by expected maturity average interest swap rate fiscal year fair value dollars in millions thereafter total liabilities long term debt  including current portion fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate derivative financial instruments related to debt interest rate swaps pay fixed receive variable average pay rate average receive rate represents the annual average libor from the forward yield curve at april  plus the weighted average margin above libor on all consolidated variable rate debt 
fair value represents the amount we would have to pay the counter party if we had terminated the swap agreements at april  we are also exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates related to our ownership interests and development activities in the uk 
for the fiscal year ended april   we recorded a gain of million in foreign currency translation adjustments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
foreign currency translation adjustments show the cumulative effect  at the balance sheet date  of fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate on balances denominated in a foreign currency  which were recorded at a historical rate at the transaction date
