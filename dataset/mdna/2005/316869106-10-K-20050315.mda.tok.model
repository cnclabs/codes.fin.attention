overview we develop  market  sell and support a software platform and framework fo r enterprise content and business process management 
this platform  calle d filenet p  provides a flexible and scaleable framework for developing solution s that provide our customers with the ability to manage content throughout thei r organizations  and streamline their business processes 
enterprise conten t management  ecm  refers to the broad range of functions used b y organizations of all types  including businesses and governmental agencies  t o control and track the information  or content  that is important to th e organization s operations  whether that information is used internally  such a s sales contracts or product diagrams  or externally  such as content provided t o customers through a web site 
the content our software manages  commonly calle d unstructured content  includes  but is not limited to web pages  wor d processing documents  spreadsheets  html  xml  pdf  document images  emai l messages and other electronic content 
our software offers customers the abilit y to configure  design  build and deploy ecm solutions to meet the needs of thei r particular business or organization 
we generate revenue by selling software licenses  delivering implementatio n and education services  and by providing technical support to our customers software revenue consists of fees earned from the licensing of our softwar e products to our customers 
implementation and education services are sold on a fee for service basis  and technical support and software maintenance ar e provided pursuant to service contracts 
annual fees for software technica l support and software maintenance are received in advance and recognized a s revenue over the duration of the contract 
earnings results are highly sensitive to fluctuations in revenue 
th e nature of our cost structure is essentially fixed with employee compensatio n and benefits being the single largest expense 
these expenses represent mor e than of our cost structure 
costs associated with variable compensatio n expense and third party royalty expenses fluctuate with revenue 
futur e profitability is contingent upon revenue growth achieved through continue d investments in internally developed or acquired software technologies that gai n market acceptance 
software the filenet p architecture provides our customers with enterprise leve l software that is scalable and flexible to handle demanding content challenge s and manage complex business processes 
the filenet p architecture provides a framework for functional expansion to provide enhanced content and proces s management across an enterprise through product suites  each emphasizing a different aspect of the ecm solution set  with functions grouped in a logica l order that are designed to meet a customer s individual ecm needs 
each suit e can be implemented by a customer individually  but remains expandable to includ e all filenet content and process management capabilities 
solutions an d applications  built by third party partners or our customers on filenet p software  are designed to manage content  allowing organizations to capture create  use  and activate that content in order to make decisions faster an d bring control and consistency to business processes  to improve efficiency an d address compliance requirements 
we license our ecm software to companies in the insurance  financia l services  government  manufacturing  telecommunications and utilitie s industries  both directly to the end user and through partners 
the growth i n software license revenue is affected by the strength of general economic an d business conditions  as well as the competitive position of our softwar e products 
our enterprise software business is characterized by long sales cycle s and timing of a few large software license transactions that can substantiall y affect our operating results 
over the last three years  customers delayed o r limited their technology capital spending compared to spending levels in the ability to meet regulatory and compliance requirements has becom e increasingly critical for large public enterprises in order to maintain prope r documentation for all key transactions 
we believe we are well positioned t o grow our revenue through our software products that address our current an d prospective customers regulatory compliance and business process improvemen t requirements 
however  we believe software revenue will continue to be affecte d by future economic conditions 
customer support we offer product support on a global basis to provide post sales services to ensure successful implementation of our products and customer satisfaction our support offering also includes right to new versions 
our customer servic e and support organization provides comprehensive support capabilities includin g electronic and real time phone support and global call tracking for customer s and partners on support programs 
system engineers deliver support coverage o n multiple platforms with hour call handling 
our web site offers the abilit y to open cases  search our knowledge base and review related status reports 
our customers typically purchase support at the time they acquire ne w software licenses and renew their software license support contracts annuall y provided their systems are still in service 
the growth of support revenue i s influenced by the renewal rate of the existing base and the amount of ne w support contracts associated with the sale of new software licenses 
we believ e that our customer support revenue will continue to grow as we sell more ne w software licenses and our customers continue to renew their product suppor t contracts 
professional services and education our worldwide professional services organization provides consulting implementation  development and other technical services and training service s to our licensed customers and authorized valuenet partners 
these services ar e provided by our internal employees and through a network of qualified servic e providers hired on a fee for service basis 
our professional service s organization offers a comprehensive methodology to help our customers design install  integrate  customize and deploy our products 
these services range fro m the management of large scale implementations of our products billed on a tim e and material basis to short term fixed price services such as softwar e installation and implementation packages  but do not include modifications t o the standard software 
our educational curriculum includes training courses for end users application developers and system administrators through media based an d instructor led training 
the purpose of our education services is to allow ou r customers to further enhance the usability of our software products throughou t their enterprise 
research and development we have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments i n research and development  through internal and offshore development activities third party licensing agreements and through technology acquisitions 
ou r development efforts focus on our filenet p platform as we continue to develo p and enhance our enterprise content and process management capabilities additionally  we license and embed third party software that is designed t o expand the functionality of our products through a variety of agreements wit h the producers of this software 
we expect research and development to remain a significant portion of our cost structure in critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements of filenet are prepared in conformit y with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts o f our wholly owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity wit h accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of americ a requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reporte d amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements an d the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  including thos e related to revenue recognition  valuation of intangible assets  reserves for ba d debt and sales returns and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical an d projected results that we believe are reasonable 
these estimates form the basi s for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and b y their nature  are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual amount s could differ from our estimates and could have a significant adverse effect o n our operating results and financial position 
the significant accountin g policies we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding an d evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition 
the nature of our business commonly includes multipl e elements in our arrangements and requires us to make judgments for determinin g the timing and the amount of revenue to recognize 
these judgments include  bu t are not limited to determining the allocation of revenue in multiple elemen t arrangements based on vendor specific objective evidence and determining th e creditworthiness of a customer to assess the probability of collection of a transaction 
we derive revenue from the following sources software  which include s software licenses  customer support revenues  which include annua l maintenance agreements  and professional services  which include consulting implementation and training services 
the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenu e recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountant s governs the basis for our software revenue recognition 
accordingly  softwar e license revenue is recognized when we enter into a legally bindin g arrangement with a customer for the license of software  we deliver th e products  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free o f contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
w e must make judgments and estimates to determine whether or not the certainty o f these elements has been met 
our software license arrangements often include multiple elements tha t consist of software  post contract customer support agreements and professiona l services such as consulting  implementation and training 
we recognize revenu e in multiple element arrangements using the residual method of revenu e recognition in accordance with sop under the residual method  the fai r value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of th e arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized a s revenue  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
i f evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does no t exist  all revenue from the arrangement is recognized when evidence of fai r value is determined or when all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for custome r support is determined by reference to the price our customers pay for suc h support when sold separately  that is  the renewal rates paid by our customers revenue from customer support contracts is recognized ratably over the term o f the arrangement  which is typically months 
vsoe of fair value fo r professional services is based upon the established pricing and discountin g practices for those services when sold separately 
historically  we have bee n able to establish vsoe for customer support and professional services  but w e may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in change s in  or the inability to support  vsoe of fair value for these undelivere d elements 
if this occurs  our future revenue recognition for multi elemen t arrangements could differ significantly from our historical results 
a majorit y of our professional service revenue is derived from time and materials base d contracts that typically range from three months to one year in duration revenue is recognized on such contracts as time is incurred and approved by th e customer 
we also provide fixed price pre packaged services that are one mont h or less in duration 
revenue from such short term fixed price contracts i s recognized upon completion of the work and customer acceptance 
short ter m fixed price contracts of a repetitive nature are more readily estimable tha n long term contracts 
our ability to make judgments about revenue and cost fo r these types of contracts has in the past been accurate 
we have little exposur e to cost overruns in professional service engagements as any additional service s are pre approved by our customers in time and material contracts and our fixe d price contracts are normally very short term in nature and highly estimable 
we use judgment in assessing whether fees are fixed and determinable an d probable of collection at the time of sale 
since customers who have previousl y deployed our products somewhere within their enterprise comprise approximatel y of software sales  our ability to assess the credit worthiness of a transaction is supported by the collection history we have with that customer in the past our ability to judge the probability of collection has been highl y accurate and we expect that this will continue 
our standard payment terms rang e from net to net days 
payments that are due within days are deemed t o be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on suc h arrangements 
to the extent we elect to provide extended payment terms beyond days for competitive or other reasons  revenue is recognized when the amount s become due 
historically  sales returns and bad debt write offs have bee n insignificant and within management s expectations 
however  any adverse change s in these trends could impact the timing of revenue recognition in the future 
in addition to direct customer sales  we sell through third party channe l partners 
our channel partners do not inventory our software products  rather shipments are made only when the partner places an order for a specific en d user 
we require our channel partners to provide us with the name and address o f all end users at the time an order is placed and  in many cases  we ship ou r products directly to the end user 
software license revenue from channe l partners is recognized when an end user is identified  product is delivere d either to a channel partner or to their designated end user and all othe r revenue recognition criteria are met 
as our channel partners only purchase ou r product for specific end users  we are not subject to channel inventory return s or price protection issues 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
we make judgments as t o our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for th e portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
we perform an initia l evaluation of the creditworthiness of our customers prior to order fulfillment and we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers to adjust credi t limits based on payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
w e monitor collections from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimate d credit losses that is based on historical experience and on specific custome r collection issues 
while credit losses have historically been within ou r expectations and the provisions established in our financial statements  w e cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rate s that we have in the past 
our accounts receivable are derived from sales to a wide variety of customers 
we do not believe a change in liquidity of any on e customer or our inability to collect from any one customer would have a materia l adverse impact on our consolidated financial position 
even though we have larg e transactions  these tend to be with large  well capitalized and credit worth y customers 
we also maintain a sales returns allowance based on historical retur n rates 
while we are not legally required to accept sales returns  we have don e so on certain occasions for our customers 
product returns have historicall y been minimal and within our expectations 
if we elect to accept a higher leve l of returns in the future for customer relations or other reasons  our results o f operations could be materially affected 
if the historical data we use t o calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts or if estimates do not properl y reflect future returns  then a change in the allowances would be made in th e period in which such a determination is made and results of operations in tha t period could be materially affected 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
our business acquisitions hav e resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded at cos t and is not amortized  but is tested for impairment at least annually and woul d be written down if impairment were determined 
effective the first day of jul y of each year  goodwill is tested for impairment by determining if the carryin g value of each reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
our reporting units ar e consistent with the reportable segments identified in note we als o periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred in betwee n annual testing dates that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not b e recoverable 
we performed an impairment analysis as of july  i n accordance with sfas the results indicated there was no impairment o f goodwill in any of the three reporting units 
as of december   ther e have been no indicators of impairment  therefore no interim impairment test s have been performed 
identified intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulate d amortization 
these assets are amortized using the straight line method ove r estimated useful lives of three to five years 
the determination of useful live s and whether or not these assets are impaired involves judgment 
long live d assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicat e that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we evaluat e these assets for impairment based on estimated undiscounted future cash flow s from these assets 
if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimate d future undiscounted cash flows  a loss would be recorded for the excess of th e asset s carrying value over the fair value 
while we have not experience d impairment of intangible assets in prior periods  we cannot guarantee that ther e will not be impairment in the future 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature an d involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates an d assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculat e projected future cash flows  future economic and market conditions  an d determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair valu e estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictabl e and uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
i n addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared asset s and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reportin g units 
future events  such as a significant decrease in our revenue profitability or market capitalization  or a change in technology could cause u s to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or othe r intangible assets associated with our acquisitions are impaired 
any resultin g impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
income taxes 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our incom e tax provision due to transactions  credits and calculations where the ultimat e tax determination is uncertain 
uncertainties arise as a consequence of th e actual source of taxable income between domestic and foreign locations  th e outcome of tax audits and the ultimate utilization of tax credits 
although w e believe our estimates are reasonable  the final tax determination could diffe r from our recorded income tax provision and accruals 
in such case  we woul d adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give ris e to the revision become known 
these adjustments could have a material impact o n our income tax provision and our net income for that period 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon th e differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax base s of assets and liabilities 
such deferred income taxes primarily relate to th e timing of the recognition of certain revenue items and the timing of th e deductibility of certain reserves and accruals for income tax purposes 
w e regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all o f the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in the current year we conclude d that the valuation allowance associated with domestic nol s and other temporar y differences should be fully reversed as a result of the current year an d cumulative domestic profits in recent years and future domestic projections however  we could be required to record additional valuation allowance agains t the deferred tax assets if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxabl e income  fail to benefit from our tax planning strategies or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time periods within whic h the underlying timing differences become taxable or deductible 
increases in th e valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income ta x provision and our net income 
conversely  if we continue to generate profits and ultimately determine that it is more likely than not that all or a portio n of the deferred tax assets will be utilized to offset future taxable income ne t of any current year stock option deductions  the remaining valuation allowanc e of million related to stock option deductions will result in an increas e to additional paid in capital

revenue generated in the united states has consistently represente d approximately of total revenue for the past three years 
international sale s volumes remained consistant for all three years in local currency 
the dolla r increase was due to favorable foreign currency rates against the dollar  th e europe  middle east  africa emea region is our largest international marke t contributing approximately of our international revenue 
asia pacific is a much smaller market for filenet  but produced revenue growth of during th e three year period from to we made significant investments in the asi a pacific region to support the revenue growth that we believe will continue t o increase in countries such as china and india 
we expect international revenue to continue to represent a significan t percentage of total revenue in the range of 
however  international revenue s will be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens against certain majo r international currencies  especially the euro  or if international economi c conditions remain relatively weak

the residual operating activity of the previously reported hardware reporting segment has been incorporated into the customer support reporting segmen t 
this reclassification is predicated on the reduced scale and change in the nature of on going hardware o perations 
the only activity in the hardware reporting segment is related to supporting legacy customers wi th spare parts and supplies  and management no longer reviews the hardware reporting segment on a stand alon e basis 
software 
software revenue consists of fees earned from the licensing o f our software products to our customers 
software revenue increased by i n compared to  and by in compared to our p platfor m and associated products were announced early in we attribute the growth i n software revenue in both and to market acceptance for these ne w products 
sales to customers who have previously deployed our products somewher e within their enterprise comprised approximately of software revenue in and drove the demand in our key vertical industries of financial services insurance  telecommunications  manufacturing  government and utilities 
we sa w these customers increase usage of our products to expand existing application s and to create new applications throughout their enterprise with our software 
w e believe the it spending environment has improved during the past two fisca l years as we have experienced the return of larger software deployments by som e of our customers 
we believe these trends will continue in with a moderate but steady improvement in it spending on enterprise content management an d business process management software as large enterprises look for software tha t supports key business applications and solves regulatory and complianc e requirements related to managing content 
customer support 
customer support revenue consists of revenue fro m software maintenance contracts  fee for service billings and the sale o f hardware spare parts and supplies 
support contracts entitle our customers t o receive technical support  bug fixes and upgrades to new versions of softwar e releases when and if available 
customer support revenue increased by i n compared to and by in compared to these increases i n customer support revenue reflect an increase in our overall customer installe d base combined with a high rate of renewal in the existing customer base customer support revenue is directly related to the sale of software licenses i n prior periods 
customer support revenue grew more slowly in both and compared to the growth rate in previous years as a result of reduced softwar e sales growth in and and software support pricing pressure 
a prolonge d economic slowdown negatively affects the growth rate of customer support revenu e as this revenue stream is directly related to software revenue growth over time however  we believe we will continue to experience a high rate of renewal o n support contracts  as our customers tend to deploy mission critical application s using our software to manage content 
professional services and education 
professional services and educatio n revenue is earned by providing consulting services to customers for the design implementation  deployment  upgrade and migration of our software products technical consulting services provided to our resellers  and training services no modifications are made to our standard base product code once the softwar e has been sold 
professional services are usually performed on a time an d material basis and are also generated from short term fixed price offerings professional services revenue and education revenue is dependent on the leve l and the nature of software sales in prior periods particularly new custome r sales 
professional services revenue decreased in compared to and the n recovered in to the levels 
we experienced fewer and smalle r consulting engagements and increased pricing pressures in the past two years competitive pricing pressures have led to higher discounts and an increased us e of partners for professional services 
the decrease in professional services an d education revenue is also affected by software revenue that has bee n characterized by repeat purchases for additional software licenses that do no t require large scale professional services engagements but rather smalle r engagements and a lesser need for customer training classes 
we believe we wil l experience a moderate  but steady improvement in professional services an d education revenue in based on the software revenue trends we experience d during the last half of  with strong dependency on new system sales t o generate the professional services and education demand from our customers

the only activity in the hardware reporting segment is related to supporting legacy customers wi th spare parts and supplies  and management no longer reviews the hardware reporting segment on a stand alon e basis 
software 
cost of software revenue includes royalties paid to third partie s for technology embedded in our products to enhance features and functionality referral fees  amortization of acquired technology  media costs  and the cost t o manufacture and distribute software 
the cost of software revenue as a percentage of software revenue grew percentage points from in t o in  resulting from higher costs not being offset by a correspondin g growth in revenue 
the increase in software cost over the period from t o resulted from increased third party fees and royalties of approximatel y million in each of and and a  increase in amortizatio n expense in related to the amortization of acquired technology resultin g from the egrail acquisition in april and the shana acquisition in apri l going forward we anticipate cost of software revenue to range betwee n of revenue 
future acquisitions resulting in additional acquire d technology and future integration of additional third party technology with ou r products would result in increased software cost  but we would expect suc h increase to be offset by increased revenue 
customer support 
the cost of customer support revenue includes the cost o f customer support personnel  facility and technology infrastructure expenses i n our call centers  and costs of supplies and hardware spare parts 
as disclose d previously  the residual operating activity of the previously reported hardwar e business segment has been combined with the customer support reporting segment we do not sell hardware to new customers 
we provide spare parts and supplies a s an accommodation to our customers who purchased filenet hardware in prior years we view this as a service to our customers 
the cost of customer support revenue as a percentage of customer suppor t revenue has decreased from in to in the combination o f increased customer support revenue along with relatively flat customer suppor t cost in all three years resulted in a lowered percent of cost in relation t o revenue 
the decrease in cost as a percent of revenue was improved by ou r reduction in hardware revenues each year  which were a high cost  low margi n segment 
customer support headcount  excluding the hardware function  has range d from employees in to in we expect the cost of custome r support revenue to range between of customer support revenue for th e near future as long as customer support revenue continues to grow at a highe r rate than costs 
we believe the current cost structure and number of personne l in the customer support organization will be sufficient to support projecte d revenue growth 
professional services and education 
cost of professional services an d education revenue consists of the costs of professional services personnel training personnel  and third party contractors 
the increase in compare d to is due to increased third party contractor expense of million partially offset by decreased facility and depreciation expense of millio n along with continued cost control in a number of expense areas 
the decrease i n cost from to resulted from the reduced usage of third part y contractors of million and lower personnel costs of million 
thes e decreases were predicated on the decreased revenue level during this period 
professional services and education revenue increased when comparin g to  while costs increased at a lower rate of due to improve d utilization of internal resources 
professional services and education revenu e and cost both decreased at the same level in compared to maintainin g cost at approximately of revenue for both years 
we believe our headcount i n the professional services and education segment allows for revenue growt h without adding additional resources 
we expect professional services an d education costs as a percentage of professional services and education revenu e to range between in the near term assuming professional services an d education revenue continues to grow

our research and development efforts focus on ou r filenet p architecture as we continue to develop and expand our ecm and bp m capabilities 
the focus of these efforts is to create functionality i n enterprise content management and business process management technology tha t provide a richer competitive product offering to our customers 
we seek to achieve our development objectives through both internal an d external resources  and by obtaining third party technology to enhance produc t capabilities through licensing agreements and acquisitions 
during w e initiated a program involving contracted offshore development in lower labo r cost countries 
during we expanded this offshore development effort t o include both product sustainment and product development activities 
we hav e also historically acquired companies to obtain their technology 
during w e acquired shana to integrate their electronic forms capabilities into ou r products 
during we acquired egrail to integrate their web conten t management capabilities into our products 
our research and development expense consists of personnel costs fo r software developers  third party contracted development efforts and relate d facilities costs 
research and development expense increased by in compared to and by in compared to the number of researc h and development personnel was in  in and in we ha d an average of contract workers in india throughout compared to a n average of contract workers in india in research and development expense increased million from to and increased million from to the million increase in is attributable to our expanded offshore development program with contractors i n india  which represented a million expense increase that was partiall y offset by reduced compensation expense of million in north america 
th e million increase from to is attributable to additiona l internal employees in north america resulting in higher compensation  benefit s and relocation costs of million  increased facility related expenses o f million associated with the integration of the egrail and shan a acquisitions in april of and  respectively  and increased consultin g expense of million associated with offshore development through contractor s in india 
we intend to continue to complement internal development with offshor e development as well as with third party software through oem agreements and ma y execute additional technology acquisitions 
over time  we believe we will b e able to lower our per developer cost through the use of offshore resources however  in the near term we do not plan on expanding our use of offshor e contract labor 
we believe that research and development expenditures  includin g compensation of technical personnel  are essential to maintaining ou r competitive position 
we expect research and development expense to rang e between of revenue assuming revenue growth in the near term  and wil l gradually decrease on a percentage basis as revenue increases 
selling and marketing 
we sell our products through a direct sales forc e and our indirect channel sales partners 
our selling and marketing expens e consists of salaries  benefits  sales commissions and other expenses related t o the direct and indirect sales force and personnel cost for marketing and marke t development programs 
selling and marketing expense increased in compared to an d increased in compared to the number of sales and marketin g employees in was compared to in and in during thi s two year period  marketing personnel increased by employees while sale s personnel decreased by employees 
this shift in sales and marketing capacit y resulted in a smaller direct sales force  with increased channel partne r business and increased marketing personnel with deep vertical industry knowledg e and demand generation capabilities 
the increase in sales and marketing expense was million from t o personnel related expenses including salaries and benefits increased million year over year due to a higher salary mix despite a reduction i n headcount 
higher total revenue in resulted in incremental commissio n expense of million in compared to additionally  travel expens e increased million in compared to due to a new sales coverag e model where resources were deployed by account rather than geography and due t o generally higher business activity 
this resulted in increased travel both i n volume and distances 
the increase in sales and marketing expense of million from t o reflects a higher salary mix as well as higher variable compensatio n associated with higher revenue in compared to personnel relate d expenses including salaries and benefits increased million year over year higher software revenue in resulted in higher commission expense of million in compared to in travel  training  and marketin g programs increased million from related to the filenet p produc t release that was announced in the first quarter of we expect selling and marketing expense to range between of revenu e in the near term  depending on revenue growth 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expense consist s of salaries  benefits  and other expenses related to personnel costs fo r finance  information technology  legal  human resources and general management and the cost of outside professional services 
general and administrative expense increased by in compared t o and increased by in compared to the number of general an d administrative employees in was compared to in and i n the million increase in absolute dollars in compared to wa s attributable to increased personnel expense of million that included meri t increases  increased bonuses and the addition of restricted stock expense increased consulting expense and accounting fees of million associated wit h our efforts to achieve compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act b y december  also contributed to the increase in essentially all o f the million increase in compared to was attributable to increase d consulting expense and legal fees associated with compliance with other section s of the sarbanes oxley act 
we expect general and administrative expense to range between o f total revenue in the near term  depending on revenue growth 
purchased in process research and development 
there were no acquisition s during and there was no in process research and development expens e associated with our april acquisition of shana 
our egrail acquisition i n april of certain assets and certain liabilities of egrail resulted in a n allocation of  to in process research and development 
the allocatio n was determined by management through established valuation techniques in th e high technology industry with the assistance of an independent third part y appraiser 
in process research and development was expensed upon acquisitio n because technological feasibility had not been established and no futur e alternative uses existed 
other income  net 
other income  net consists of interest income earned o n our cash  cash equivalents and investments  and other items including foreig n exchange gains and losses 
other income  net of other expenses  was millio n in  million in and million in the increase in compared to was due almost entirely to an increase in interest income o f million based on increased cash  cash equivalents and investment amount s and a higher weighted average interest rate 
the weighted average interest rat e earned on cash  cash equivalents and investments was in  i n and in the overall decrease in from of millio n was primarily attributable to a lower net foreign exchange gain of approximatel y  due to a continued weakening of the dollar against the euro in and reduced interest income of approximately  due to a lowe r weighted average interest rate in compared to provision for income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes was millio n in  compared to a provision for income taxes of million in and o f million in the effective tax rate was   and for th e years ended december   and  respectively 
the decreased ta x rate in was due to the benefit of million from the reversal of th e valuation allowance associated with domestic net operating loss carryforward s and other temporary differences 
subsequent to the reversal of the valuatio n allowance  we expect our on going effective tax rate to range between these rates  however  can fluctuate outside our expectations depending upon th e mix of our profits between domestic and lower taxed foreign locations 
quarterly results of operations quarterly revenues and expenses have historically been affected by a variety of factors  including the timing of large enterprise transactions seasonality of economic activity in europe  and to some degree the timing o f budget approvals in the government sector 
historically  the fourth quarter i s our highest quarter and we expect these trends to continue in the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly information fo r our last eight fiscal quarters 
this information has been prepared on the sam e basis as the consolidated financial statements and all necessary adjustment s which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments have been included in th e amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read i n conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related note s included elsewhere herein

cash and cas h equivalents consist of high quality and highly liquid investments in short ter m money market funds  united states government agency discount notes  an d corporate notes 
cash equivalent investments include instruments with origina l maturities of days or less 
short term investments include auction rat e securities and instruments with maturities of greater than days and less tha n days 
long term investments consist of high grade corporate and governmen t securities with maturities greater than months and less than three years 
our two major sources of cash  as more fully discussed below  have bee n cash generated from operations and cash generated from financing activities cash flows from operations was million in  million in an d million in cash provided by financing activities was millio n in  million in and million in net income is a primary source of cash from operating activities 
ne t income was million  million and million in  and respectively 
depreciation and amortization added to net income to provide cas h from operating activities although the amount has declined each year due t o tight budgetary control over capital spending 
depreciation and amortization wa s million in  million in and million in our cas h from operations is also impacted by changes in working capital accounts 
change s in accounts receivable and unearned revenue have typically had the larges t impact on our cash flows 
the days sales outstanding metric  which is calculate d by dividing quarter end accounts receivable by average daily sales for th e quarter  was days  days and days as of december   and respectively 
we believe that we will continue to generate cash fro m unearned revenues but expect increases in cash due to declines in account s receivable to lessen 
we attempt to structure our sales contracts to require a majority of payments in days or less  and all payments in days or less 
t o the extent that competitive pressures require us to extend our terms  it woul d result in a decrease to our operating cash flows 
our annual customer suppor t agreements are typically prepaid at the beginning of the support period resulting in a large cash inflow and a corresponding increase in deferre d revenue 
this has historically resulted in significant cash inflows in the firs t quarter  when the largest portion of our support agreements renews 
we expec t this trend to continue in the future 
net cash used for investing activities was million in  million in and million in capital spending has been fairl y consistent and under tight budgetary control and accounted for net cash used o f million in  million in and million in we do no t expect capital expenditure levels in to differ significantly from the leve l of the past few years 
significant changes in cash from investing activitie s have resulted from the purchase and sale of investments and  to a lesser extent cash paid for acquisitions 
excess cash from operations is invested in hig h quality debt instruments and securities  and the timing of purchases an d maturities of investments could result in significant short term fluctuations i n net cash used or generated from investing activities 
as long as we continue t o generate excess cash  we expect to invest such amounts and thus continue to sho w a net use of cash related to investing activities 
however  based on the natur e of our investment policy  all such investments are available in the short ter m if needed for any reason 
net cash provided by financing activities results from the proceeds o f common stock related to employee stock option plans and employee stock purchas e plans 
as previously noted  the cash generated from this activity increased t o million from million in and million in stock price s favorably influenced this activity 
as long as our stock price is greater tha n the exercise price of outstanding stock options  we expect to continue t o generate cash from option exercises 
the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents held i n foreign currency resulted in net cash inflows in all three years as the euro an d other currencies progressively strengthened against the dollar 
we have no borrowing arrangements as of december  on june  our million multi currency revolving line of credit expired in accordanc e with its terms and was not renewed because the cost of carrying the line did no t justify the level of usage 
we have been able to meet escrow needs throug h existing bank relationships in the united states and internationally 
we believe that our present cash balances  together with internall y generated funds  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capita l expenditures throughout see risk factors 
commitments 
we lease certain of our facilities under noncancelabl e operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through we hav e certain royalty commitments associated with licensing of third party product s that require minimum payments or contractual prepayments

the cost will be recognized over the period during which a n employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  usually th e vesting period 
the accounting provisions of fas r will be effective as o f the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins afte r june  we will adopt the provisions of fas r on july  using a modified prospective application 
under the modified prospective application fas r  will apply to new awards  unvested awards that are outstanding on th e effective date and any awards that are subsequently modified or cancelled compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the requisite service ha d not been rendered as of the effective date will be recognized over the remainin g service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosur e purposes under fas note stock based compensation 
we are in the proces s of determining how the new method of valuing stock based compensation a s prescribed in fas r will be applied to valuing stock based awards grante d after the effective date and the impact the recognition of compensation expens e related to such awards will have on our financial statements

we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact o n the price of our products  the cost of our materials  or our operating result s for any of the three years ended december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates t o our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments i n our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuer s and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
w e protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market an d reinvestment risk 
our investments in marketable securities consist o f high grade corporate and government securities with maturities of less tha n three years 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months o r less are considered to be cash equivalents 
we classify all of our investment s as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separate componen t of stockholders equity 
average maturity of our investment portfolio i s approximately months  therefore  the movement of interest rates should no t have a material impact on our balance sheet or income statement 
at any time  a significant increase decrease in interest rates will have a n impact on the fair market value and interest earnings of our investmen t portfolio 
we do not currently hedge this interest rate exposure 
we hav e performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical basis points and basis points adverse movement in the level s of interest rates across the entire yield curve  which are representative o f historical movements in the federal funds rate with all other variables hel d constant 
the analysis covers our investment and is based on th e weighted average maturity of our investments as of december  and the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical basis points advers e movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of ou r investment instruments of approximately  at december  an d approximately  at december  similarly a hypothetical basi s points adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fai r values of our investments of approximately  at december  an d approximately  at december  the following table provides information about our investment portfolio a t december  in thousands estimated debt securities cost fair value due in one year or less short term munis taxable   corporate   governments agencies   total due in one year   due in one to three years government agencies   total due in one to three years   grand total   actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issue r of the securities may have the right to repurchase such securities 
we classif y short term investments in current assets  as all such investments are availabl e for current operations 
foreign currency fluctuations our performance can be affected by changes in foreign currency value s relative to the us dollar in relation to our revenue and operating expenses we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts in an effort to hedg e against the effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates on monetary asset s and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency o f the relevant entity mainly in europe and asia pacific 
we have not entere d into forward foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
ou r accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of th e contracts as hedging transactions 
gains and losses on foreign exchang e contracts are recognized in income in the same period as gains and losses occur our forward contracts have an original maturity of three months 
these contract s were opened on the last business day of the quarter and thus had a nominal fai r value as of december  cumulative other comprehensive income increased from a gain of millio n during  to a gain of million during  due to unrealized foreig n currency translation gains of million resulting from the strengthening o f the euro against the us dollar during
