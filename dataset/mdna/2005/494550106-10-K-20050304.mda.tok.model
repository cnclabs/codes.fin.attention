item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations provides you with a narrative on our financial results 
it contains a discussion and analysis of the results of operations for each segment of our business  followed by a discussion and analysis of our financial condition 
the following discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this report and were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 
additional sections in this report which should be helpful to your reading of our discussion and analysis include the following o a description of our business strategy and management philosophy  found in items and business and properties business strategy  o a description of developments during  found in items and business and properties recent developments  and o a description of risk factors affecting us and our business  found in items and business and properties risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures  we must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  the fair values used to determine possible asset impairment charges  provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable  exposures under contractual indemnifications and various other recorded or disclosed amounts 
however  we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our financial statement preparation process than others  which policies are discussed following 
environmental matters with respect to our environmental exposure  we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts 
often  as the remediation evaluation and effort progresses  additional information is obtained  requiring revisions to estimated costs 
these revisions are reflected in our income in the period in which they are reasonably determinable 
we routinely conduct reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations 
in december  we recognized a million increase in environmental expenses and an associated million increase in deferred income tax expense resulting from changes to previous estimates 
the adjustment included an million increase in our estimated environmental receivables and reimbursables and a million increase in our overall accrued environmental and related claim liabilities 
we included the additional million environmental expense within other  net in our accompanying consolidated statement of income for the million expense item  including taxes  is the net impact of a increase in expense in our products pipelines business segment  a million decrease in expense in our natural gas pipelines segment  a million decrease in expense in our co segment  and an million decrease in expense in our terminals business segment 
in december  we recognized a million reduction in environmental expense and in our overall accrued environmental liability  and we included this amount within other  net in our accompanying consolidated statement of income for the million reduction in environmental expense resulted from a million increase in expense in our products pipelines business segment and a million decrease in expense in our terminals business segment 
for more information on our environmental disclosures  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
legal matters we are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as the result of our business operations and transactions 
we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders  judgments or settlements 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates  our earnings will be affected 
we expense legal costs as incurred and all recorded legal liabilities are revised as better information becomes available 
sfpp  lp is the subsidiary limited partnership that owns our pacific operations  excluding calnev pipe line llc and related terminals acquired from gatx corporation 
tariffs charged by sfpp are subject to certain proceedings at the federal energy regulatory commission involving shippers complaints regarding the interstate rates  as well as practices and the jurisdictional nature of certain facilities and services  on our pacific operations pipeline systems 
generally  the interstate rates on our pacific operations pipeline systems are grandfathered under the energy policy act of unless substantially changed circumstances are found to exist 
to the extent substantially changed circumstances are found to exist  our pacific operations may be subject to substantial exposure under these ferc complaints 
we estimated  as of december   that shippers claims for reparations totaled approximately million and that prospective rate reductions would have an aggregate average annual impact of approximately million 
as the timing for implementation of rate reductions and the payment of reparations is extended  total estimated reparations and the interest accruing on the reparations increase 
for each calendar quarter of delay in the implementation of rate reductions sought  we estimate that reparations and accrued interest accumulates by approximately million 
we now assume that any potential rate reductions will be implemented no earlier than the third quarter of and that reparations and accrued interest thereon will be paid no earlier than the third quarter of  however  the timing  and nature  of any rate reductions and reparations that may be ordered will likely be affected by the ferc s income tax allowance inquiry in docket no 
pl and the ferc s disposition of issues remanded by the dc circuit in the bp west coast decision 
if the phase two initial decision were to be largely adopted by the ferc  the estimated reparations and rate reductions would be larger than noted above  however  we continue to estimate the combined annual impact of the rate reductions and the capital costs associated with financing the payment of reparations sought by shippers and accrued interest thereon to be approximately cents of distributable cash flow per unit 
we believe  however  that the ultimate resolution of these complaints will be for amounts substantially less than the amounts sought

intangible assets effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these accounting pronouncements introduced the concept of indefinite life intangible assets and required us to prospectively cease amortizing all of our intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives  including goodwill 
such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite 
these rules also impact future period net income by an amount equal to the discontinued goodwill amortization offset by goodwill impairment charges  if any  and adjusted for any differences between the old and new rules for defining intangible assets on future business combinations 
additionally  a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value 
we completed this initial transition impairment test in june and determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of january  we have selected an impairment measurement test date of january of each year and we have determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of january  as of january   our goodwill was million 
estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and gas we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities 
the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved reserves  both developed and undeveloped 
the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect  among other things  whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed  the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities 
the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing for impairment of such properties also rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 
our estimation of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas is a highly technical process performed primarily by in house reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals 
independent oil and gas consultants have reviewed the estimates of proved reserves of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that we have attributed to our net interest in oil and gas properties as of december  proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
estimates of proved reserves may change  either positively and negatively  as additional information becomes available and as a contractual  economic and political conditions change

in  we earned net income of million per diluted unit on revenues of  million  compared to net income of million per diluted unit on revenues of  million in  and net income of million per diluted unit on revenues of  million in we benefited from a growing demand for energy products  overall higher energy prices and our management s continued commitment to its business strategy  designed to increase financial performance through a combination of internal asset expansions and external acquisitions 
in  we benefited from a cumulative effect adjustment of million related to a change in accounting for asset retirement obligations pursuant to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations on january  our income before the cumulative effect adjustment totaled million per diluted unit

because our partnership agreement requires us to distribute of our available cash to our partners on a quarterly basis available cash consists primarily of all our cash receipts  less cash disbursements and changes in reserves  we consider each period s earnings before all non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses  including amortization of excess cost of equity investments  to be an important measure of our success in maximizing returns to our partners 
in each of the years and  all four of our reportable business segments reported year over year increases in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization  with the strongest growth coming from our co carbon dioxide and natural gas pipelines business segments 
the year over year increases in our segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in and were attributable both to internal growth and to contributions from acquired assets  more specifically o higher earnings from our co segment  where we benifited from higher oil and gas prices  acquisitions of additional oil reserve interests and related assets  and internal capital spending that both increased and expanded asset infrastructure in order to accommodate growing customer demand within the permian basin area of west texas  o higher earnings from our natural gas pipelines segment  largely due to improved margins on natural gas sales activities  higher natural gas operational sales  and the further optimization of the large natural gas sourcing and transportation operations we conduct within the state of texas  o higher earnings from our products pipelines segment  mainly due to higher revenues from refined product terminal operations  higher deliveries of refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids resulting from increased military and industrial demand  and the acquisition of our southeast terminal operations  which consist of refined petroleum products terminals that were acquired since december  and o higher earnings from our terminals segment  primarily due to higher revenues earned by transporting and storing petroleum and petrochemical related liquids  transloading higher volumes of dry bulk material products  completed expansion projects at existing liquids and bulk terminal facilities  and the terminal acquisitions we have made since the end of we declared a record cash distribution of per unit for the fourth quarter of an annualized rate of 
this distribution was higher than the per unit distribution we made for the fourth quarter of  and higher than the per unit distribution we made for the fourth quarter of we expect to declare cash distributions of at least per unit for  however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve this level of distribution 
our general partner and our common and class b unitholders receive quarterly distributions in cash  while kmr  the sole owner of our i units  receives quarterly distributions in additional i units 
the value of the quarterly per share distribution of i units is based on the value of the quarterly per share cash distribution made to our common and class b unitholders

b includes expense of  and  in and  respectively  associated with environmental expense adjustments 
c includes pacific  plantation  north system  calnev  central florida  cypress and heartland pipeline volumes 
our products pipelines segment s primary businesses include transporting refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids through pipelines and operating high quality liquid petroleum products terminals and transmix processing facilities 
the segment reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in this compared to earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in and earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in as noted in the table above  the segment s and earnings included charges of million and million  respectively  from the adjustment of our environmental liabilities referred to in critical accounting policies and estimates environmental matters 
excluding these environmental charges  segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization totaled million in and million in the million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to excluding the environmental charge was driven primarily by higher earnings from our southeast terminals  our pacific operations  earnings from our proportionate ownership interest in the cochin pipeline system  and to a lesser extent by higher earnings from our west coast terminal operations  our central florida and cypress pipelines  and our transmix operations 
our southeast terminals  which include the operations of refined products terminals located in the southeastern united states that we acquired in december  march  and november  reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million in our pacific operations reported a million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in  compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to incremental fees earned from ethanol related services  higher refined product delivery revenues  and incremental revenues related to the refined products terminal operations we acquired from shell oil products in october effective october   we acquired an additional undivided interest in the cochin pipeline system for approximately million and we now own approximately of cochin  an approximate  mile pipeline that transports natural gas liquids to the midwestern united states and eastern canada petrochemical and fuel markets 
cochin s earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million in compared to the increase was primarily driven by higher revenues from pipeline throughput deliveries as well as our additional ownership interest 
earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from our west coast terminals increased million in compared to the increase was largely attributable to higher fees from ethanol blending services  primarily driven by revenue increases across all service activities performed at our carson  california and our connected los angeles harbor product terminals 
the increases in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to were partly offset by lower earnings from our calnev pipeline and north system natural gas liquids pipeline 
calnev and the north system reported decreases of million and million  respectively  in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in versus for calnev  the decrease was driven by higher fuel and power expenses  higher operating expenses  and lower miscellaneous revenues 
for our north system  the decrease was primarily due to higher leased storage expenses  due to higher fees  and lower transport revenues  related to a decrease in throughput delivery volumes 
the decline in north system delivery volumes was primarily due to a lack of propane supplies in february through april of  caused by shippers reducing line fill and storage volume to lower levels than last year 
in april  we filed a plan with the federal energy regulatory commission to provide a line fill service  which we expect will mitigate the supply problems we experienced on our north system in the first half of pursuant to this plan  we purchased million of line fill during the million increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to excluding the environmental charge resulted from higher earnings from our pacific operations  north system  calnev pipeline  transmix operations  central florida pipeline  our approximate ownership interest in plantation pipe line company and our west coast terminal operations 
earnings in were positively impacted by higher revenues  mainly from fees for ethanol blending services at our pacific operations and west coast terminals  and from higher product delivery revenues related to overall strong demand for diesel fuel 
the overall increase was partially offset by lower earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from both our proportionate interest in the cochin pipeline system and our cypress pipeline  mainly due to lower operating revenues 
in addition  due to the continued process of converting from methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe to ethanol in the state of california  we realized a small reduction in california gasoline volumes 
since the end of  mtbe blended gasoline is being replaced by an ethanol blend  and ethanol is not shipped in our pipelines  however  fees that we earn from ethanol related services at our terminals positively contribute to our earnings 
as of december   we had ethanol blending facilities in place at all of our california terminals necessary to serve all of our customers 
the million increase in segment revenues in compared to was driven by million of incremental revenues attributable to the acquisition of our southeast terminals 
in addition  revenues from our pacific operations increased million and revenues from our proportionate share of cochin increased million 
our pacific operations year over year increase was due to both the higher terminal revenues  discussed above  and higher transport revenues  due largely to an almost increase in mainline delivery volumes 
cochin s increase in revenues was mainly due to a increase in delivery volumes and to higher average tariff rates 
the increase in delivery volumes in versus was partly related to lower product inventory levels in western canada in the first half of  caused by a drop in propane production 
the drop in propane production was a reaction to lower profit margins from the extraction and sale of natural gas liquids caused by a rise in natural gas prices since the end of revenues from our central florida pipeline increased million in compared to the increase was due to an almost increase in product delivery volumes 
combined  the segment benefited from a increase in the volume of refined products delivered during compared to combining all of the segment s operations  total throughput delivery of refined petroleum products  consisting of gasoline  diesel fuel and jet fuel  increased in compared to jet fuel delivery volumes  boosted by strong military and solid commercial demand  were up nearly in compared to  and gasoline delivery volumes increased 
deliveries of diesel fuel were essentially flat across both and  but both gasoline and diesel volumes were impacted in the fourth quarter of by the shut down of a refinery connected to the plantation pipeline following hurricane ivan 
the million increase in segment revenues in compared to was driven by a million increase in combined revenues from our pacific operations and west coast terminals  largely due to increased terminal services 
revenues from our north system increased million in versus although throughput deliveries on our north system dropped by in  we benefited from a increase in average tariff rates as a result of an increased cost of service tariff agreement filed with the federal energy regulatory commission in may revenues from our calnev pipeline increased million in versus  due to higher revenues from both refined product deliveries and fees associated with ethanol blending operations 
calnev benefited from a increase in the average tariff per barrel transported  due mostly to an increase in transportation of longer haul  higher margin barrels 
revenues from our combined transmix operations increased million in compared to  primarily due to higher processing volumes at our transmix facilities located in richmond  virginia and indianola  pennsylvania 
revenues from our central florida pipeline operations also increased by million in versus  due to higher storage revenues at our liquids terminal located in tampa  florida and to higher refined product delivery revenues associated with a increase in delivery volumes 
the overall increase in segment revenues in compared to was offset by a million decrease in revenues from our investment in the cochin pipeline system and a million decrease in revenues earned from our cypress pipeline 
in addition to the impact of lower propane production described above  cochin s earnings and revenues were negatively impacted by a pipeline rupture and fire in july that led to the shut down of the system for days during the third quarter 
the year to year drop in cypress revenues was due to lower throughput volumes and to customers catching up on liquids volumes earned but not delivered in prior periods 
for the segment as a whole  total throughput delivery of refined petroleum products decreased in compared to the decrease resulted from the transition from mtbe blended gasoline to ethanol blended gasoline  and the fact that ethanol cannot be transported via pipeline but must instead be blended at terminals 
our combined diesel and jet fuel deliveries  however  increased in versus  mainly due to a increase in diesel delivery volumes and to improvement in jet fuel delivery volumes in the fourth quarter of the segment s operating expenses increased million in compared to the increase was mainly due to incremental expenses of million from our southeast terminals and to a million increase in expenses from our pacific operations  largely the result of higher fuel and power expenses associated with higher utility rates and higher delivery volumes 
the segment also reported million year over year increases in expenses in from each of the cochin pipeline  north system  calnev pipeline and plantation pipeline 
cochin s increase was related to higher expenses associated with the increased delivery volumes and our additional ownership interest 
the north system s increase was primarily due to higher natural gas liquids storage expenses 
calnev s increase was mostly due to higher fuel and power expenses due to favorable credit adjustments to electricity access and surcharge reserves taken in the first nine months of plantation s increase was primarily related to higher labor  testing and maintenance expenses 
the segment s operating expenses remained relatively flat in  compared to earnings from our products pipelines equity investments were million in  million in and million in earnings from equity investments consist primarily of earnings from our approximate ownership interest in plantation pipe line company and our ownership interest in heartland pipeline company  both accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the million decrease in equity earnings in compared to was mainly due to a million decrease in equity earnings from plantation  mainly due to a million expense recorded in the first quarter of for our share of an environmental litigation settlement reached between plantation and various plaintiffs 
in  we expect to recover the cost of the settlement under various insurance policies 
the million increase in equity earnings in versus was primarily due to a million increase in equity earnings related to our ownership interest in plantation 
the increase resulted primarily from higher litigation settlement costs recognized during the fourth quarter of  partially offset by lower earnings from product deliveries in excluding the and environmental charges  interest and other income items decreased million in versus  and increased million in versus both changes were largely due to higher gains realized from sales of property  plant and equipment by our pacific operations during non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization charges  including amortization of excess cost of investments  were million  million and million in each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase in versus was primarily due to incremental depreciation charges from our southeast terminals and to higher depreciation expenses from our pacific operations 
the million increase in versus was driven by higher property and plant depreciation expenses from our pacific operations  calnev pipeline and west coast terminals 
excluding the incremental depreciation expenses related to the acquisition of our southeast terminals  the year over year increases in depreciation expenses in both and related to the capital spending we have made since the end of in order to strengthen and enhance our business operations on the west coast 
for  we currently expect that our products pipelines segment will report earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of approximately million  a increase over excluding the environmental charge 
the earnings increase is expected to be driven by continued improvement in gasoline and jet fuel delivery volumes  planned capital improvements and expansions including our pacific operations north line expansion completed in december  and a full year of operations from products terminals acquired in march and november natural gas pipelines year ended december  in thousands  except operating statistics revenues    operating expenses a    earnings from equity investments    other  net income b   income taxes   earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and amortization of excess cost of equity investments    depreciation  depletion and amortization expense    amortization of excess cost of equity investments segment earnings    natural gas transport volumes trillion btus c    natural gas sales volumes trillion btus d a includes natural gas purchases and other costs of sales  operations and maintenance expenses  fuel and power expenses and taxes  other than income taxes

transcolorado annual volumes are included for all three years acquisition date november  
d represents texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group 
kinder morgan tejas sales volumes are included for all three years acquisition date january  our natural gas pipelines segment s primary businesses involve marketing  transporting and storing natural gas through both intrastate and interstate pipeline systems 
in  the segment reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of  million 
this compared to earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of  million in and earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of  million in as noted in the table above  the segment s earnings include a million increase from the adjustment of our environmental liabilities referred to in critical accounting policies and estimates environmental matters 
excluding this environmental adjustment  segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million in compared to this increase  along with the million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in versus  was primarily attributable to higher earnings from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group  which includes the operations of the following four natural gas pipeline systems kinder morgan tejas  kinder morgan texas pipeline  north texas pipeline and mier monterrey mexico pipeline 
the year over year increases in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group were mainly due to improved margins and higher volumes from natural gas sales activities  strong returns from capital investments made since the end of  and incremental earnings from value added services  including storage  blending and other services 
since our acquisition of kinder morgan tejas on january   we have increased the interconnection capability between its system and kinder morgan texas pipeline  improved system processes and controls and further refined the management of risk associated with the sale and transmission of natural gas 
kinder morgan tejas operations include a  mile intrastate natural gas pipeline system that has access to a number of natural gas supply basins in the state of texas  kinder morgan texas pipeline s operations include approximately  miles of pipelines  supply and gathering lines  laterals and related facilities principally located in the texas gulf coast area 
these two systems comprise the major components of our texas intrastate group and together reported a million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to in  the two systems combined reported a million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization compared to furthermore  we have continued to grow internally and have developed and built new natural gas pipeline systems to transport gas from expanding production areas and to serve new market areas 
contributions from the two remaining texas intrastate systems  our north texas pipeline  completed in august  and our mier monterrey pipeline  completed in march  accounted for million of the segment s total increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to  and million of the segment s total increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to the increases were driven by higher transportation revenues linked to growing demand for natural gas in both texas and the monterrey  mexico region 
our rocky mountain interstate natural gas pipeline operations consist of the following three natural gas pipeline systems kinder morgan interstate gas transmission  trailblazer pipeline and transcolorado pipeline 
we acquired transcolorado gas transmission company from kmi effective november  the transcolorado system includes a mile interstate natural gas pipeline that originates in the piceance basin of western colorado and runs to the blanco hub in northwest new mexico 
all three pipelines charge a transportation fee for gas transmission service and have the authority to initiate natural gas sales primarily for operational purposes  but none engage in significant gas purchases for resale 
operational natural gas sales are primarily made possible by collection of fuel in kind pursuant to each pipeline s natural gas transportation tariff 
together  our rocky mountain pipelines reported a million decrease in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to the decrease was due to lower earnings from our trailblazer pipeline  mainly due to lower revenues as a result of timing on imbalance cashouts and lower transportation revenues 
the decreases in transportation revenues were due to lower tariff rates that became effective january   pursuant to a rate case settlement 
in  kmigt and trailblazer accounted for million of the segment s total increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization compared to the increase in over was mainly due to the benefits resulting from an expansion of our trailblazer pipeline system 
in may  we completed a fully subscribed  million expansion project on the trailblazer system that expanded its transportation capacity by  dekatherms of natural gas per day 
the expansion increased capacity on the pipeline by approximately and provided new firm long term transportation service 
as a result  trailblazer realized a increase in natural gas transportation volumes in compared to in each of the years and  the segment reported significant increases in both revenues and operating expenses when compared to the year earlier period 
revenues earned by our natural gas pipelines segment increased million in versus  and  million in versus operating expenses  including natural gas purchase costs  increased million in compared to  and  million in compared to the year over year increases in revenues and operating expenses were primarily attributable to the internal growth and integration of our kinder morgan tejas and kinder morgan texas pipeline systems since the end of both pipeline systems buy and sell significant volumes of natural gas  which is also transported on their pipelines  and our objective is to match purchases and sales  thus locking in the equivalent of a transportation fee 
we manage remaining price risk by the use of energy financial instruments 
combined  the two systems reported increases in natural gas sales revenues of million in compared to  and  million in compared to both increases were due to higher average sale prices and higher sales volumes  the increase in compared to resulted from an almost increase in average gas prices from per dekatherm in to per dekatherm in and an almost increase in gas sales volumes 
revenues from our recently acquired transcolorado pipeline totaled million in kinder morgan tejas and kinder morgan texas pipeline together reported combined increases in costs of sales of million in compared to  and  million in compared to both increases were due to higher average costs of natural gas sold and higher volumes of gas purchased for sale  the increase in compared to resulted from an increase in the average price of purchased gas from per dekatherm in to per dekatherm in and a increase in gas purchase volumes 
due to the offsetting nature of gas sales and cost of gas sold  we believe that earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization or a similar measure of margin  defined as revenues less cost of gas sold  is a better comparative performance indicator than revenues because the mix of utility volumes between sales and transportation service affects revenues but not margin 
we account for the segment s investments in red cedar gas gathering company  coyote gas treating  llc and thunder creek gas services  llc under the equity method of accounting 
in  equity earnings from these three investees decreased million compared to the decrease was chiefly due to lower earnings from our investment in red cedar  mainly due to higher operational sales of natural gas by red cedar in earnings from equity investments were relatively flat across and  higher earnings in from our investment in thunder creek were largely offset by lower earnings from our investment in red cedar 
the segment s non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization charges  including amortization of excess cost of investments decreased a slight million in compared to  primarily due to lower year to year depreciation expense on our trailblazer pipeline 
the decrease was due to the rate case settlement which became effective january  the million increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization charges in over was primarily due to incremental depreciation charges related to the completed north texas and mier monterrey pipeline systems 
for  we currently expect that our natural gas pipelines segment will report earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of approximately million  a increase over excluding the environmental expense adjustment 
the earnings increase is expected to be driven by additional earnings realized from the sale of natural gas at higher margins  increases in storage and transportation services  the benefits of reaching new markets and customers by planned capital spending  and a full year of operations from our transcolorado pipeline

the segment s primary businesses involve the production  transportation and marketing of carbon dioxide  commonly called co  and the production and marketing of crude oil and natural gas 
in  our co segment reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million 
this compared to earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in and earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in as noted in the table above  the segment s earnings include a million increase from the adjustment of our environmental liabilities referred to in critical accounting policies and estimates environmental matters 
excluding the increase from this environmental adjustment  segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million in compared to this increase  along with the million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in over  was driven by higher earnings from oil and gas producing activities and gas processing activities  higher deliveries of carbon dioxide  and strategic acquisitions of additional working interests in the sacroc and yates oil field units since the end of excluding earnings attributable to the environmental liability adjustment  our co segment s oil and gas producing activities and gas processing activities reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million in  million in and million in these increases of million and million from to and from to  respectively  were primarily attributable to increased oil production volumes  increases in the realized weighted average price of oil per barrel  and acquisitions of additional ownership interests in oil producing properties 
these acquisitions included the following o effective june   we acquired mkm partners  lp s ownership interest in the sacroc oil field unit for million in cash and the assumption of million of liabilities 
this transaction increased our ownership interest in the sacroc unit to approximately  and o effective november   we acquired certain assets in the permian basin of west texas from a subsidiary of marathon oil corporation for million in cash and the assumption of million of liabilities 
the assets acquired included marathon s approximate interest in the yates oil field unit  the crude oil gathering system surrounding the yates field unit and marathon s ownership interest in the pecos carbon dioxide pipeline company 
this transaction increased our ownership interest in the yates oil field unit to nearly and allowed us to become operator of the field 
excluding earnings attributable to the environmental liability adjustment  our co segment s carbon dioxide sales and carbon dioxide and crude oil transportation activities reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million in  million in and million in the increase of million in compared to was driven by higher revenues from carbon dioxide sales and deliveries  mainly due to higher average carbon dioxide sale prices and higher transportation volumes related to infrastructure expansions at the sacroc and yates oil field units 
the increase of million in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to was chiefly due to higher revenues from carbon dioxide pipeline delivery volumes  including the operations of our centerline carbon dioxide pipeline  which was completed and began operations in may capacity and deliverability of carbon dioxide in and around the permian basin has expanded since the end of in order to accommodate growing customer demand 
in  capital expenditures for our co business segment totaled million  higher than the million of capital expenditures made during  and higher than the million of expenditures in the year over year increases largely represented incremental spending for new well and injection compression facilities at the sacroc and  to a much lesser extent  yates oil field units in order to enhance oil recovery from carbon dioxide injection 
in  we also benefited from the acquisition of the kinder morgan wink pipeline  a mile crude oil pipeline located in west texas 
effective august   we acquired all of the partnership interests in kinder morgan wink pipeline  lp for million in cash and the assumption of million in liabilities 
the acquisition of the pipeline and associated storage facilities allows us to better manage crude oil deliveries from our oil field interests in west texas 
the wink pipeline contributed million in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization during the last four months of revenues earned by our co business segment increased million in compared to  and million in compared to the increases were mainly due to higher crude oil and gasoline plant product sales revenues  driven by higher oil production volumes  higher average crude oil and gasoline product prices  and the additional working interest in the yates oil field that we acquired in november combined  the assets we acquired on november  contributed incremental revenues of approximately million in daily oil production at the sacroc and yates field units  both located in the permian basin of west texas  increased and  respectively  in compared to  and and  respectively  in compared to we also benefited from increases of and  respectively  in our realized weighted average price of oil and natural gas liquids per barrel in compared to  and a increase in our realized weighted average price of oil per barrel in compared to as a result of our carbon dioxide and oil reserve ownership interests  we are exposed to commodity price risk associated with physical crude oil and carbon dioxide sales that have pricing tied to crude oil prices  but the risk is mitigated by our long term hedging strategy that is intended to generate more stable realized prices 
for more information on our hedging activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
additionally  in both and  we realized higher revenues from carbon dioxide transportation services 
the year over year increases were mainly due to higher transportation volumes  due to continued strong demand for carbon dioxide throughout the permian basin 
combined deliveries of carbon dioxide on our central basin pipeline  our majority owned canyon reef carriers and pecos pipelines  our centerline pipeline  and our owned cortez pipeline  which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting  increased in and in in  we also realized higher revenues from carbon dioxide sales  due to higher average prices  however  revenues from the sales of carbon dioxide were lower in compared to due to a larger elimination of intercompany profit  in  related to an increase in the volumes of our carbon dioxide utilized in our own operations 
we do not recognize profits on carbon dioxide sales to ourselves 
incremental revenues earned by our kinder morgan wink pipeline totaled million in as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  the cost of carbon dioxide that is associated with enhanced recovery is capitalized as part of our development costs when it is injected 
the carbon dioxide costs incurred and capitalized as development costs for our co segment were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we estimate that such costs will be approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
it is expected that  due to the nature of this enhanced recovery process and the characteristics of the underlying reservoir  the capitalized cost for carbon dioxide in will represent a peak and is expected to decline thereafter 
in addition  as of december   our projected expenditures for developing our proved undeveloped reserves will be approximately million in  million in  and million in both the million increase in operating expenses in versus  and the million increase in operating expenses in versus  were primarily related to higher operating and maintenance expenses  higher fuel and power costs  and higher production taxes  all as a result of higher oil production volumes  higher carbon dioxide delivery volumes  and increases in oil reserve ownership interests and segment assets 
earnings from equity investments decreased million in compared to the decrease resulted from the absence of equity earnings  in  from our previous ownership interest in mkm partners  lp following our june  acquisition of its interest in the sacroc unit  mkm partners was dissolved effective june   and the lack of equity earnings in more than offset a million increase in equity earnings from our investment in the cortez pipeline company 
the increase in equity earnings from cortez was mainly due to higher carbon dioxide delivery volumes in versus the million increase in earnings from equity investments in compared to reflects the net of a million increase in equity earnings from our investment in cortez pipeline company  partially offset by a million decrease in equity earnings from our previous interest in mkm partners  lp the increase in earnings from our equity interest in cortez was mainly due to higher carbon dioxide delivery volumes  lower average debt balances and slightly lower borrowing rates 
non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization charges  including amortization of excess cost of equity investments  were up million in compared to and million in compared to the increases were primarily due to year over year increases in production volumes  capital investments  and acquisitions of property interests 
in addition  the capital additions we have made since the end of have increased the unit of production depletion rates 
for  we currently expect that our co segment will report earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of approximately million  a increase over excluding the environmental expense adjustment 
the earnings increase is expected to be driven by the continuing development of the sacroc and yates oil field units

excluding these environmental adjustments  segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million in compared to  and increased million in compared to the million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in over was driven by higher revenues from both our bulk and liquids terminal businesses  due to i higher transfer volumes of bulk products  ii higher demand for storage and distribution services offered for petroleum and liquid chemical products  and iii additional storage and throughput capacity due to both terminal acquisitions and the completion of capital projects since the end of combined  our bulk terminal facilities reported an almost increase in total bulk tonnage volumes transloaded during  as compared to in turn  completed capital expansions and betterments at our liquids facilities since the end of  which included the construction of additional petroleum products storage tanks  have increased our liquids storage capacity by approximately  barrels  and at the same time  we have increased our liquids utilization capacity 
for terminal operations owned during both and  growth in both segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization charges and segment revenues were primarily attributable to record throughput at our gulf coast liquids terminals  and to higher coal  bulk and synfuel volumes from certain of our mid atlantic terminals  which include our chesapeake bay  maryland bulk terminal and our pier ix bulk terminal located in newport news  virginia 
our two gulf coast liquids terminals  located on the houston  texas ship channel  reported a combined million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to the increase was driven by a million increase in revenues resulting from higher throughput volumes  contract price escalations  additional service contracts and new pipeline connections 
our chesapeake bay facility reported a million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to the increase was driven by a million increase in revenues  earned by providing additional stevedoring services and storage and transportation for products such as coal  petroleum coke  pig iron and steel slag 
our pier ix terminal  which transloads both coal and cement and operates a synfuel plant on site  reported a million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to the increase was driven by a million increase in revenues resulting from higher synfuel revenues and coal activity 
in february  pier ix began to operate a second synfuel plant on site 
approximately half of the million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in over was attributable to expansion projects at existing liquids terminals  and the remainder was attributable to contributions from the bulk and liquid terminal businesses we acquired since september  terminal acquisitions completed since the fourth quarter of helped increase both segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization and segment revenues in versus these acquisitions primarily consisted of the following o the kinder morgan tampaplex marine terminal and inland bulk storage warehouse facility  both located in tampa  florida and acquired in december o the terminals owned and operated by kinder morgan river terminals llc and its consolidated subsidiaries  acquired effective october   and o the kinder morgan fairless hills bulk terminal facility  acquired effective december  combined  these businesses  in  contributed incremental earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million and incremental revenues of million 
excluding earnings attributable to the environmental adjustments  million of the segment s million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization  and million of the total million increase in revenues in versus was attributable to internal growth  largely resulting from the expansion projects undertaken to increase leaseable liquids capacity at our liquids terminal facility located in carteret  new jersey on the new york harbor  and at our two gulf coast liquids terminals 
we completed the construction of five  barrel petroleum products storage tanks at our carteret facility since the end of the third quarter of combined  these expansion projects contributed to an almost increase in our overall liquids terminals leaseable capacity in compared to  more than offsetting the slight drop in our overall utilization percentage in over half of the decline in utilization during was associated with tank maintenance 
in addition to the contributions to earnings and revenues that were attributable to capital expansions  we benefited from additional liquids storage contracts  escalations in annual contract provisions at many of our liquids facilities  and higher returns from our ownership interest in the international marine terminals partnership 
imt  which operates a bulk commodity transfer terminal facility located in port sulphur  louisiana  reported increases of million in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization  and million in revenues in versus the increases were driven by an almost increase in bulk tonnage transfer volume  primarily coal and iron ore  and by higher dockage revenues 
the remaining million of the segment s year to year increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization and million of the year to year increase in revenues in versus was attributable to strategic acquisitions of new terminal businesses acquired since september   including the following o the owensboro gateway terminal  acquired effective september   o the st 
gabriel terminal  acquired effective september   o the purchase of four floating cranes at our bulk terminal facility in port sulphur  louisiana in december  o the bulk terminal businesses acquired from mj rudolph corporation  effective january   and o the two bulk terminal businesses in tampa  florida  acquired in december the segment s overall increases in both earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization and revenues in compared to included decreases of million and million  respectively  from our cora coal terminal facility located near cora  illinois 
the decrease in coal revenues and earnings was primarily related to an expected decrease in coal tonnage handled under contract for the tennessee valley authority 
the tva has diverted some of its business to new competing coal terminals that have come on line since the end of both the million increase in operating expenses in compared to and the million increase in operating expenses in compared to  were due to the year over year increases in bulk tonnage transfer volumes  liquids throughput and storage capacity  and the terminal acquisitions described above 
the increases were primarily reflected as higher operating  maintenance  fuel and electricity expenses  including payroll  trucking  equipment rental and docking expenses  all related to increased dry bulk and liquids product transfers and ship conveyance activities 
income tax expenses totaled million in excluding the million tax expense on earnings attributable to adjustments to the environmental liabilities recorded by taxable entities  million in and million in the million increase in income tax expense in compared to was primarily due to incremental expense related to the taxable income of certain subsidiaries of kinder morgan river terminals llc 
the million decrease in income tax expense in compared to was primarily due to favorable tax adjustments related to the taxable income and tax paying obligations of kinder morgan bulk terminals  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization charges were million  million and million in each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
both the million increase in versus and the million increase in versus were primarily due to property acquisitions and capital spending  and to adjustments made to the estimated remaining useful lives of depreciable property since the end of for  we currently expect that our terminals segment will report earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of approximately million  a increase over excluding the environmental expense adjustment  net of taxes 
the earnings increase is expected to be driven by on going capital expansion projects  by expected increases in bulk tonnage transfer volumes  and by incremental earnings from the inclusion of a full year of operations from kinder morgan river terminals llc and the kinder morgan fairless hills terminal

we also included both the million loss from our early extinguishment of debt in and the million benefit from the cumulative effect adjustment of a change in accounting for asset retirement obligations as of january  discussed above  as items not attributable to any business segment 
the loss from the early extinguishment of debt represented the excess of the price we paid to repurchase and retire the principal amount of million of tax exempt industrial revenue bonds over the bonds carrying value 
we assumed these industrial revenue bonds as part of our january acquisition of kinder morgan liquids terminals llc 
pursuant to certain provisions that gave us the right to call and retire the bonds prior to maturity  we took advantage of the opportunity to refinance at lower rates 
for more information on our early extinguishment of debt  see note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
our general and administrative expenses include such items as salaries and employee related expenses  payroll taxes  legal fees  insurance and office supplies and rentals 
overall general and administrative expenses totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was principally due to higher employee bonus and benefit expenses  higher corporate and employee related insurance expenses  and higher corporate service expenses  including legal  internal audit and human resources 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to higher legal expenses  higher employee benefit and pension costs and higher overall corporate and employee related insurance expenses 
we continue to aggressively manage our infrastructure expense and to focus on our productivity and expense controls 
interest expense  net of interest income  totaled million in  million in and million in although our average borrowing rates were essentially flat across both and  we incurred a million increase in net interest charges in as a result of higher average borrowings 
the increase in average borrowings was primarily due to higher capital spending related to internal expansions and improvements  and to incremental borrowings made in connection with acquisition expenditures 
for more information on our capital expansion and acquisition expenditures  see liquidity and capital resources investing activities 
the million increase in net interest items in compared to reflects higher average borrowings since the end of  partially offset by decreases in average borrowing rates 
minority interest  which includes the general partner interest in our five operating limited partnerships  totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase in versus resulted mainly from higher overall partnership income  partly offset by our november acquisition of the remaining approximate ownership interest in midtex gas storage company  llp that we did not already own  thereby eliminating the associated minority interest 
the million decrease in compared to resulted primarily from our may acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in trailblazer pipeline company that we did not already own  thereby eliminating the associated minority interest 
liquidity and capital resources we attempt to maintain a conservative overall capital structure  with a long term target mix of approximately equity and debt

our centralized cash management program provides that funds in excess of the daily needs of our operating partnerships and their subsidiaries are concentrated  consolidated  or otherwise made available for use by other entities within our consolidated group 
we place no restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities  payment of inter company balances or the ability to upstream dividends to parent companies 
in addition  certain of our operating subsidiaries are subject to federal energy regulatory commission enacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs 
ferc regulated entities subject to these rules must  among other things  place their cash management agreements in writing  maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements  and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc 
our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses  are debt service  sustaining capital expenditures  expansion capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to our common unitholders  class b unitholders and general partner 
in addition to utilizing cash generated from operations  we could meet our cash requirements other than distributions to our common unitholders  class b unitholders and general partner through borrowings under our credit facility  issuing short term commercial paper  long term notes or additional common units or issuing additional i units to kmr 
in general  we expect to fund o cash distributions and sustaining capital expenditures with existing cash and cash flows from operating activities  o expansion capital expenditures and working capital deficits with retained cash resulting from including i units in the determination of cash distributions per unit but paying quarterly distributions on i units in additional i units rather than cash  additional borrowings  the issuance of additional common units or the issuance of additional i units to kmr  o interest payments with cash flows from operating activities  and o debt principal payments with additional borrowings  as such debt principal payments become due  or by the issuance of additional common units or the issuance of additional i units to kmr 
as a publicly traded limited partnership  our common units are attractive primarily to individual investors  although such investors represent a small segment of the total equity capital market 
we believe that some institutional investors prefer shares of kmr over our common units due to tax and other regulatory considerations 
we are able to access this segment of the capital market through kmr s purchases of i units issued by us with the proceeds from the sale of kmr shares to institutional investors 
short term liquidity our principal sources of short term liquidity are our revolving bank credit facility  our billion short term commercial paper program which is supported by our revolving bank credit facility  with the amount available for borrowing under our credit facility being reduced by our outstanding commercial paper borrowings and cash provided by operations 
in august  we replaced our previous day and three year credit facilities  which had a combined borrowing capacity of billion  with a five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility that has a borrowing capacity of billion 
our five year bank facility is due august   and can be used for general corporate purposes and as a backup for our commercial paper program 
there were no borrowings under our credit facility as of december  after inclusion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings and letters of credit  the remaining available borrowing capacity under our bank facility was million as of december  for the year ended december   we continued to generate strong cash flow from operations  and we provided for additional liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity related to our commercial paper program and long term revolving credit facility 
as of december   our outstanding short term debt was million

capital requirements for recent transactions during  our cash outlays for the acquisitions of assets and equity investments totaled million 
with the exception of our acquisition of transcolorado  which was partially acquired by the issuance of additional common units to kmi  we utilized our commercial paper program to fund these acquisitions and then reduced our short term borrowings with the proceeds from our february and november issuances of common units  our march and november issuances of i units  and our november issuance of long term senior notes 
we intend to refinance the remainder of our current short term debt and any additional short term debt incurred during through a combination of long term debt  equity and the issuance of additional commercial paper to replace maturing commercial paper borrowings

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  million in  versus million in the million period to period increase in compared to includes the following cash flow increases o a million increase in cash from overall higher partnership income in  net of non cash items including depreciation  depletion and amortization charges and undistributed earnings from equity investments  o a million increase in cash inflows relative to net changes in working capital items  and o a million increase related to transportation rate reparation and refund payments made in the higher partnership income reflects the increased level of segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization reported in and discussed in results of operations 
the favorable inflows from working capital in were mainly related to timing differences in the payments made on our trade and related party account payables 
in addition to timing differences  we made higher payments to settle related party payables at the beginning of  primarily for reimbursements to kmi for costs related to the construction of our mier monterrey natural gas pipeline and for general and administrative services 
the reparation and refund payments made in were mandated under an order from the federal energy regulatory commission pursuant to a consolidated proceeding in ferc docket or concerning rates charged by our pacific operations on certain interstate portions of their products pipelines 
offsetting the overall increase in cash provided by operating activities was a million decrease in distributions received from equity investments and an million decrease related to higher payments made in on non current accounts  most notably  higher capitalizable project costs and higher cash settlements on long term reserves and other deferred credits 
the decrease in distributions from our equity investments was primarily due to lower distributions from our previous investment in mkm partners  lp and our current investment in the red cedar gas gathering company 
mkm partners  lp was dissolved on june   thereby eliminating our equity ownership interest  and the decrease in distributions from our equity ownership interest in red cedar related to its lower earnings in versus investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
the million increase in funds utilized in investing activities was mainly attributable to higher payments made for capital expenditures  strategic acquisitions  and incremental purchases of natural gas liquids related to the initiation of our north system s line fill program 
partially offsetting the overall increase in cash used in investing activities was a million decrease in contributions to equity investments  mainly due to lower contributions made to plantation pipe line company 
including expansion and maintenance projects  our capital expenditures were million in versus million in the million increase was mainly driven by higher capital investment in our products pipelines and co business segments  as we continued to expand and grow our existing asset infrastructure by adding both throughput capacity to our products pipelines and production and delivery capacity to our oil field and carbon dioxide flooding operations 
our sustaining capital expenditures were million for  compared to million for additionally  we continue to make significant investments in strategic acquisitions to fuel future growth and increase unitholder value 
during  our acquisition outlays for assets and investments totaled million  a million increase over the million spent for acquisitions in both our and acquistion expenditures are discussed more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we also spent million in pursuant to the implementation of our north system s natural gas liquids line fill program  as discussed in results of operations 
the line fill program calls for us to purchase natural gas liquids to be used as pipeline line fill and pass the carrying costs on to our shippers through a cost of service filing with the ferc 
as of december   we had purchased approximately  barrels of propane  normal butane and natural gasoline  which we believe will help mitigate the operational constraints that resulted from a lack of product supplies caused by shippers reducing their inventory levels at the close of the winter season 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million in the million period to period decrease in cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from lower cash inflows from overall debt financing activities and from higher partnership distributions 
these overall decreases in cash provided by financing activities were partially offset by an increase in cash inflows from overall partnership equity issuances and an increase in temporary cash book overdrafts 
during each of the years and  we used our commercial paper borrowings to fund our asset acquisitions  capital expansion projects and other partnership activities  and we subsequently raised funds to refinance a portion of those borrowings by completing public offerings of senior notes and by issuing additional common units and i units 
we used the proceeds from these debt and equity issuances to reduce our borrowings under our commercial paper program 
in  we received million from overall debt financing activities  which included both issuances and payments of debt  loans to related parties and debt issuance costs 
in  our debt financing activities provided us with million in cash 
the million period to period net decrease was primarily due to the following o a million decrease in net incremental commercial paper borrowings in versus  o an million decrease related to payments  in  to redeem and retire the principal amount of five series of tax exempt bonds related to certain liquids terminal facilities 
pursuant to certain provisions that gave us the right to call and retire the bonds prior to maturity  we took advantage of the opportunity to refinance at lower rates  o a million decrease related to a long term loan we made to plantation pipe line company in  which corresponded to our ownership interest and allowed plantation to pay all of its outstanding credit facility and commercial paper borrowings 
in exchange  we received a seven year note receivable bearing interest at the rate of per annum  o a million decrease related to payments made to retire a significant portion of the million of outstanding debt assumed as part of our october acquisition of kinder morgan river terminals  llc  o a million decrease related to payments made to retire all of the outstanding debt assumed as part of our august acquisition of kinder morgan wink pipeline  lp  and o a million increase related to payments made in december to retire the outstanding balance under sfpp  lp s series f notes 
in addition  in each of november and  we closed public offerings of million in principal amount of senior notes 
the offerings resulted in cash inflows  net of discounts and issuing costs  of million and million  respectively 
cash distributions to all partners  consisting of our common and class b unitholders including kmi  our general partner  and minority interests  increased to million in compared to million in the million increase in distributions was due to increases in the per unit cash distributions paid  the number of outstanding units and the resulting increase in our general partner incentive distributions 
the million period to period increase in cash inflows from additional partnership equity issuances was related to the excess of cash received from our issuances of both common and i units over cash received from our june issuance of common units 
in  we received proceeds of million from additional partnership equity issuances  primarily consisting of the following amounts are net of all commissions and underwriting expenses o million received from our issuance of  common units in a february public offering  o million received from our issuance of  i units in march to kmr  o million received from our issuance of  common units in a november public offering  and o million received from our issuance of  i units in november to kmr 
by comparison  in  we received net proceeds of million from additional partnership equity issuances  mainly the result of million received from the issuance of  of our common units in a june public offering 
in both and  we used the proceeds from each of these issuances to reduce the borrowings under our commercial paper program 
the million period to period increase in cash inflows from cash book overdrafts resulted from temporary increases in outstanding checks due to timing differences in the payments of year end accruals and outstanding vendor invoices in versus we paid distributions of per unit in compared to per unit in the increase in distributions paid per unit principally resulted from favorable operating results in we also distributed  and  i units in quarterly distributions during and  respectively  to kmr  our sole i unitholder 
the amount of i units distributed in each quarter was based upon the amount of cash we distributed to the owners of our common and class b units during that quarter of and for each outstanding i unit that kmr held  a fraction of an i unit was issued 
the fraction was determined by dividing the cash amount distributed per common unit by the average of kmr s shares closing market prices for the ten consecutive trading days preceding the date on which the shares began to trade ex dividend under the rules of the new york stock exchange 
partnership distributions our partnership agreement requires that we distribute of available cash  as defined in our partnership agreement  to our partners within days following the end of each calendar quarter in accordance with their respective percentage interests 
available cash consists generally of all of our cash receipts  including cash received by our operating partnerships and net reductions in reserves  less cash disbursements and net additions to reserves and amounts payable to the former general partner of sfpp  lp in respect of its remaining interest in sfpp 
our general partner is granted discretion by our partnership agreement  which discretion has been delegated to kmr  subject to the approval of our general partner in certain cases  to establish  maintain and adjust reserves for future operating expenses  debt service  maintenance capital expenditures  rate refunds and distributions for the next four quarters 
these reserves are not restricted by magnitude  but only by type of future cash requirements with which they can be associated 
when kmr determines our quarterly distributions  it considers current and expected reserve needs along with current and expected cash flows to identify the appropriate sustainable distribution level 
for  and  we distributed  and  of the total of cash receipts less cash disbursements  respectively calculations assume that kmr unitholders received cash 
the difference between these numbers and of distributable cash flow reflects net changes in reserves 
our general partner and owners of our common units and class b units receive distributions in cash  while kmr  the sole owner of our i units  receives distributions in additional i units 
we do not distribute cash to i unit owners but retain the cash for use in our business 
however  the cash equivalent of distributions of i units is treated as if it had actually been distributed for purposes of determining the distributions to our general partner 
available cash is initially distributed to our limited partners and to our general partner 
these distribution percentages are modified to provide for incentive distributions to be paid to our general partner in the event that quarterly distributions to unitholders exceed certain specified targets 
available cash for each quarter is distributed o first  to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  o second  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  o third  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  and o fourth  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata  to owners of common units and class b units in cash and to owners of i units in the equivalent number of i units  and to our general partner 
incentive distributions are generally defined as all cash distributions paid to our general partner that are in excess of of the aggregate value of cash and i units being distributed 
our general partner s incentive distribution that we declared for was million  while the incentive distribution paid to our general partner during was million 
the difference between declared and paid distributions is due to the fact that our distributions for the fourth quarter of each year are declared and paid in the first quarter of the following year 
on february   we paid a quarterly distribution of per unit for the fourth quarter of this distribution was greater than the distribution per unit we paid for the fourth quarter of and greater than the distribution per unit we paid for the first quarter of we paid this distribution in cash to our common unitholders and to our class b unitholders 
kmr  our sole i unitholder  received additional i units based on the cash distribution per common unit 
we believe that future operating results will continue to support similar levels of quarterly cash and i unit distributions  however  no assurance can be given that future distributions will continue at such levels 
litigation and environmental as of december   we have recorded a total reserve for environmental claims  without discounting and without regard to anticipated insurance recoveries  in the amount of million 
the reserve is primarily established to address and clean up soil and ground water impacts from former releases to the environment at facilities we have acquired 
reserves for each project are generally established by reviewing existing documents  conducting interviews and performing site inspections to determine the overall size and impact to the environment 
reviews are made on a quarterly basis to determine the status of the cleanup and the costs associated with the effort and to identify if the reserve allocation is appropriately valued 
in assessing environmental risks in conjunction with proposed acquisitions  we review records relating to environmental issues  conduct site inspections  interview employees  and  if appropriate  collect soil and groundwater samples 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information on our pending environmental and litigation matters  respectively 
we believe we have established adequate environmental and legal reserves such that the resolution of pending environmental matters and litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business  cash flows  financial position or results of operations 
however  changing circumstances could cause these matters to have a material adverse impact 
regulation the pipeline safety improvement act of requires pipeline companies to perform integrity tests on natural gas transmission pipelines that exist in high population density areas that are designated as high consequence areas 
pipeline companies are required to perform the integrity tests within ten years of december   the date of enactment  and must perform subsequent integrity tests on a seven year cycle 
at least of the highest risk segments must be tested within five years of the enactment date 
the risk ratings are based on numerous factors  including the population density in the geographic regions served by a particular pipeline  as well as the age and condition of the pipeline and its protective coating 
testing will consist of hydrostatic testing  internal electronic testing  or direct assessment of the piping 
a similar integrity management rule for refined petroleum products pipelines became effective may  all baseline assessments for products pipelines must be completed by march   and at least half of the line pipe affecting high consequence areas was required to be assessed by september  we have included all incremental expenditures estimated to occur during associated with the pipeline safety improvement act of and the integrity management of our products pipelines in our budget and capital expenditure plan

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk generally  our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be other than trading 
our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates or commodity prices 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based on actual fluctuations in interest rates or commodity prices and the timing of transactions 
energy financial instruments we are exposed to commodity market risk and other external risks  such as weather related risk  in the ordinary course of business 
we take steps to limit our exposure to these risks in order to maintain a more stable and predictable earnings stream 
accordingly  we use energy financial instruments to reduce our risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas  natural gas liquids  crude oil and carbon dioxide 
to minimize the risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas  natural gas liquids  crude oil and carbon dioxide  we use certain financial instruments for hedging purposes 
these instruments include energy products traded on the new york mercantile exchange and over the counter markets  including  but not limited to  futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps and basis swaps 
while we enter into derivative transactions only with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings  it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 
the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we purchase energy financial instruments are as follows credit rating morgan stanley a j 
aron company goldman sachs a bnp paribas aa we account for our risk management derivative instruments under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities after amendment by sfas no 
and sfas no 

as discussed above  our principal use of derivative financial instruments is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas  natural gas liquids  crude oil and carbon dioxide 
sfas no 
allows these transactions to be treated as hedges for accounting purposes  although the changes in the market value of these instruments will affect comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and any ineffectiveness in the risk mitigation performance of the hedge will affect net income currently 
the change in the market value of these instruments representing effective hedge operation will continue to affect net income in the period in which the associated physical transactions are consummated 
our application of sfas no 
has resulted in deferred net loss amounts of million and million being reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss in our accompanying balance sheets as of december  and december   respectively 
we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas  natural gas liquids  crude oil and carbon dioxide markets utilizing a value at risk model 
value at risk is a statistical measure of how much the mark to market value of a portfolio could change during a period of time  within a certain level of statistical confidence 
we utilize a closed form model to evaluate risk on a daily basis 
the value at risk computations utilize a confidence level of for the resultant price movement and a holding period of one day chosen for the calculation 
the confidence level used means that there is a probability that the mark to market losses for a single day will not exceed the value at risk number presented 
financial instruments evaluated by the model include commodity futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps  basis swaps and over the counter options 
for each of the years ended december  and  value at risk reached a high of million and million  respectively  and a low of million and million  respectively 
value at risk as of december   was million and averaged million for value at risk as of december   was million and averaged million for our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivatives assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 
in addition  as discussed above  we enter into these derivatives solely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities and  therefore  the change in the market value of our portfolio of derivatives  with the exception of a minor amount of hedging inefficiency  is offset by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions 
for more information on our risk management activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
interest rate risk the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 
we utilize both variable rate and fixed rate debt in our financing strategy 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information related to our debt instruments 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows 
we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
as of december  and  the carrying values of our long term fixed rate debt were approximately  million and  million  respectively  compared to fair values of  million and  million  respectively 
fair values were determined using quoted market prices  where applicable  or future cash flow discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
a hypothetical change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt for and  respectively  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair values of these instruments 
the carrying value and fair value of our variable rate debt  including associated accrued interest and excluding market value of interest rate swaps  was million as of december  and million as of december  fair value was determined using future cash flows discounted based on market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
a hypothetical change in the average interest rate applicable to our variable rate debt  including adjustments for notional swap amounts as of december  and  would result in changes of approximately million and million in our and annualized pre tax earnings  respectively 
as of december  and  we were a party to interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts of billion and billion  respectively 
we entered into these agreements for the purpose of hedging the interest rate risk associated with our fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
a hypothetical change in the average interest rates related to these swaps would not have a material effect on our annual pre tax earnings in or we monitor our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under our variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swaps or other interest rate hedging agreements 
in general  we attempt to maintain an overall target mix of approximately fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
as of december   our cash and investment portfolio did not include fixed income securities 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
since we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio
