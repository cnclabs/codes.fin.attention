item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the fiscal years ended october   october  and september   should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements 
our discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  opinions  expectations  anticipations and intentions and beliefs 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under the risk factors  special note about forward looking statements and business sections and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in the following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition  certain financial measures may be considered non gaap financial measures under securities and exchange commission rules 
these rules require supplemental explanation and reconciliation  which is provided in exhibit to this annual report on form k  and is incorporated by reference herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
as described in such notes  the company recognizes sales in the period in which services are provided pursuant to the terms of our contractual relationships with our clients 
in preparing our financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are most significant where they involve levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or matters susceptible to change  and where they can have a material impact on our financial condition and operating performance 
we discuss below the more significant estimates and related assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
asset impairment determinations as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized 
under this accounting standard  goodwill is subject to an impairment test that we conduct at least annually  using a discounted cash flow technique 
with respect to our other long lived assets  we are required to test for asset impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in order to determine whether or not an asset was impaired 
this standard requires an impairment analysis when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the standard indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows from the asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
in making future cash flow analyses of various assets  the company makes assumptions relating to the following the intended use of assets and the expected future cash flows resulting directly from such use 
comparable market valuations of businesses similar to aramark s business segments 
industry specific economic conditions 
competitor activities and regulatory initiatives 
client and customer preferences and behavior patterns 
we believe that an accounting estimate relating to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to change from time to time and the recognition of an impairment could have a significant impact on our income statement 
environmental loss contingencies accruals for environmental loss contingencies ie  environmental reserves are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can reasonably be estimated 
management views the measurement of environmental reserves as a critical accounting estimate because of the considerable uncertainty surrounding estimation  including the need to forecast well into the future 
we are involved in legal proceedings under state  federal and local environmental laws in connection with operations of our uniform rental segment or businesses conducted by our predecessors or companies that we have acquired 
the calculation of environmental reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information  prior experience in the remediation of contaminated sites and assumptions with respect to government regulations and enforcement activity  changes in remediation technology and practices  and financial obligations and credit worthiness of other responsible parties and insurers 
litigation and claims the company is a party to various legal actions and investigations including  among others  employment matters  compliance with government regulations  including import and export controls and customs laws  federal and state employment laws  including wage and hour laws  dram shop laws  environmental laws  contractual disputes and other matters  including matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
these claims may be brought by  among others  the government  clients  customers  employees and third parties 
management considers the measurement of litigation reserves as a critical accounting estimate because of the significant uncertainty in some cases relating to the outcome of potential claims or litigation and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of potential liability involved  coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from litigation or other claims 
in determining legal reserves  management considers  among other issues interpretation of contractual rights and obligations 
the status of government regulatory initiatives  interpretations and investigations 
the status of settlement negotiations 
prior experience with similar types of claims 
whether there is available insurance 
advice of counsel 
allowance for doubtful accounts we encounter risks associated with sales and the collection of the associated accounts receivable 
we record a provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate provision  management analyzes the creditworthiness of specific customers and the aging of customer balances 
management also considers general and specific industry economic conditions  industry concentrations  such as exposure to the non profit healthcare sector and the airline industry  and contractual rights and obligations 
management believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from time to time and uncollectible accounts could potentially have a material impact on our results of operations 
inventory obsolescence we record an inventory obsolescence reserve for obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory  principally in the uniform and career apparel segments 
in calculating our inventory obsolescence reserve  management analyzes historical data regarding customer demand within specific product categories and makes assumptions regarding economic conditions within customer specific industries  as well as style and product changes 
management believes that its accounting estimate related to inventory obsolescence is a critical accounting estimate because customer demand in certain of our businesses can be variable and changes in our reserve for inventory obsolescence could materially affect our financial results 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the amount of deferred income taxes take in to account estimates of the amount of future taxable income  and actual operating results in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates 
critical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions warrant  and changes to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed conditions require revision 
results of continuing operations on may   the company completed the sale of its educational resources segment see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the fiscal operating results for this business are reported as discontinued operations 
the following tables present our sales and operating income from continuing operations  and the related percentages attributable to each operating segment for fiscal years  and fiscal was a week year  and fiscal and were week years

the comparison was affected by the cancellation of the national hockey league season 
the national hockey league collective bargaining agreement expired in september and on september  the owners of the nhl teams locked out the nhl players 
sales from nhl venues were approximately million in the period 
in july  the nhl and the nhl players association announced they had reached an agreement for the hockey season and the hockey season has commenced 
for fiscal  sales growth in the business services sector was in the mid single digits  driven primarily by base business growth in corrections and refreshment services 
sales growth in the education sector was in the high single digits  also reflecting base business growth 
the healthcare sector reported high single digits sales growth due to base business growth and net new business 
sports entertainment sector sales declined approximately as improved performance at convention centers  parks and resorts and existing stadiums and arenas was more than offset by the nhl lockout  the loss of two major league baseball clients and a weaker concert schedule in our amphitheaters 
segment operating income increased compared to the prior year 
the period includes approximately million representing our share of the gain from a real estate sale by a owned equity affiliate 
excluding the million  operating income increased 
fiscal operating income increased despite the negative effect of the nhl lockout  due primarily to strong performances in the education sector and the healthcare sector  where prior year results were lowered by start up costs at new accounts and high labor and material costs in the clinical equipment services business 
fiscal was also positively affected by improved sports entertainment results at convention centers  existing stadiums and arenas and our parks and resorts 
operating income margin improved slightly in fiscal food and support services international segment sales in the food and support services international segment increased compared to the prior year due to foreign currency translation approximately  acquisitions approximately  net new accounts approximately  and increased volume approximately 
strong sales growth in canada  germany  and chile was partially offset by sales declines in the uk due to challenging trading conditions and lost business 
segment operating income increased  compared to the prior year  of which approximately represented currency translation 
the period includes a charge of million representing the estimated cost of exiting the west african oil services business and a management separation charge in the uk 
during the second quarter  the decision was made to cease operations in west africa 
this business has been operating at a loss and efforts to renegotiate a client contract have proved unsuccessful 
we are working towards an orderly withdrawal and expect to exit the region shortly 
provision has been made for the losses  principally asset write offs  expected to be incurred during the withdrawal 
fiscal results were negatively affected by losses from the offshore oil service operations and several fourth quarter accounting adjustments in the uk 
the fiscal period also includes currency transaction gains of approximately million 
broadly affecting year over year comparisons  improved results in canada and germany were partially offset by lower operating income in the uk due to the challenging trading environment and lost business 
uniform and career apparel rental segment uniform and career apparel rental segment sales increased compared to the prior year 
organic sales growth  which excludes the effects of acquisitions and divestitures  was 
growth in the sales of apparel and ancillary products to rental customers contributed to this performance 
operating income increased due to increased sales  lower garment costs and a gain on the sale of a dormant property  partially offset by higher energy costs and labor related expenses  new systems implementation costs and increased selling expense 
operating income margin improved slightly for the year 
uniform and career apparel direct marketing segment uniform and career apparel direct marketing segment sales decreased from the prior year period 
wearguard crest continued to experience lower demand in the quick service restaurant channel and sales of safety products remained soft 
segment operating income was million compared to million in fiscal operating income has decreased due to lower sales volume  gross margin erosion at wearguard crest and costs related to the opening of a new distribution center 
margins have been negatively affected by the roll out of a new program in the quick service restaurant channel 
corporate corporate expenses  those administrative expenses not allocated to the business segments  were million for fiscal  compared to million in the prior year 
fiscal includes the million charge related to the resignation of the company s former chief executive officer announced in september fiscal includes increases related to the cost of sarbanes oxley compliance and restricted stock units 
outlook looking forward to fiscal  we anticipate a steady economic environment and stable employment levels 
although we expect some lingering impact from the hurricanes  particularly in the education and sports entertainment businesses  the resumption of nhl hockey should have a positive effect on operating results 
if energy costs remain at historically high levels  margins in our uniform rental segment will continue to be pressured  and we expect the direct marketing segment will continue to be affected by lower than historical sales growth and margin pressures 
we expect higher interest expense in due principally to recent rate increases  and fiscal results will reflect the effect of expensing stock options  as required by the revised statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated overview sales for fiscal were billion  an increase of over fiscal sales increased in our worldwide food and support business while sales in the combined uniform and career apparel segments were about even with the prior year

excluding these three items for comparison purposes  operating income increased in further  excluding the impact of acquisitions  foreign currency translation  the estimated effect of the rd week in and the effect of the calendar shift on the education sector  operating income increased over the prior year  as higher income in the us food and support and uniform rental segments was largely offset by reduced income from the international and direct marketing segments 
consolidated operating income margin  excluding the above three items was in and in while the margin in the us food and support segment was even with last year and the uniform rental margin increased slightly  reduced operating income in the international and direct marketing segments resulted in a decrease in consolidated margin 
interest and other financing costs  net  decreased compared to the prior year  due primarily to the debt extinguishment loss recorded in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements and the impact of lower average borrowing levels and lower interest rates in fiscal the effective income tax rate was in fiscal and in in  a favorable adjustment  resulting from the closing of certain open tax years  reduced the effective rate by

fiscal was a week year which included one additional week of operations and resulted in fiscal starting one week later than normal  causing a lack of service day comparability in the education sector 
adjusting for the rd week and the effect of the fiscal calendar shift  sales increased approximately  due to acquisitions approximately  increased volume approximately and net new accounts approximately 
sales increased in all of our business sectors on a comparable week week basis 
business services sector sales growth was in the mid single digits driven by a balance of base business growth and net new business 
base business growth resulted in high single digit sales growth in the education sector 
the facilities sector reported low double digit sales growth resulting from both net new accounts and base business growth 
the healthcare corrections sector reported low double digit sales growth due to base business growth and net new accounts 
sales in the sports entertainment sector grew in the high single digits attributable to acquisitions  base business growth and net new accounts 
segment operating income decreased compared to the prior year  which included results of the extra fiscal week and approximately million of insurance proceeds from the september th claim 
excluding these two items from fiscal  operating income increased approximately of which approximately was contributed by acquisitions 
fiscal segment operating income was influenced by a number of factors 
the positive effect of base business and new account sales growth was constrained as a result of start up transition costs at new healthcare accounts  increased healthcare clinical service labor and material costs  higher labor related expenses including workers compensation  state unemployment insurance and healthcare costs  and somewhat higher food costs  particularly at education accounts 
broadly affecting year over year comparisons  improved operating performance in the sports entertainment sector was substantially offset by lower operating income in the facilities sector 
the fourth quarter settlement of the school support services civil litigation resulted in a favorable accrual adjustment of approximately million 
food and support services international segment sales in the food and support services international segment increased compared to the prior year

fiscal segment operating income increased 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the estimated rd week impact  operating income decreased compared to the prior year 
further  excluding acquisitions  operating income decreased approximately in increased operating income in germany and spain was more than offset by the decrease in uk operating results 
uk results were negatively affected by a number of factors  including losses from certain offshore oil services operations approximately million and several fourth quarter accounting adjustments approximately million 
the accounting adjustments included write offs of amounts previously recorded as due from vendor programs  and a reserve for possible obligations under client contracts 
management has begun improvement initiatives in these areas  which will continue into fiscal fiscal includes currency transaction gains of approximately million 
uniform and career apparel rental segment uniform and career apparel rental segment fiscal sales increased compared to the prior year 
adjusting for the estimated effect of the rd week in fiscal  sales growth was approximately  with acquisitions contributing about 
the expanded sales force and slight improvement in employment levels resulted in increased net new sales and a slowing of the volume reduction at existing accounts 
price increases also contributed approximately to the growth 
fiscal segment operating income increased compared to the prior year 
net new sales growth  price increases  and lower garment costs resulting from expanded self manufacturing activity drove the income increase 
improvement was constrained by the continuing high cost of fuel  increases in labor related expenses and the cost of expanding the sales force 
uniform and career apparel direct marketing segment uniform and career apparel direct marketing segment sales in decreased compared to the prior year 
adjusting for the effect of the rd week in  sales were about even to the prior year 
comparable week sales in the fourth quarter of decreased approximately from the prior year quarter  as sales of safety products were negatively affected by the ongoing department of commerce investigation involving certain export sales at galls 
while export sales are not significant  the investigation has had a dampening effect on demand from government agencies see legal proceedings 
segment operating income decreased approximately compared to the prior year 
reduced margin attributable to the decrease in sales of safety products and costs associated with the investigation were the principal causes of the decrease 
wearguard crest results were also negatively affected as a result of a customer mix shift to lower margin products and the effects of starting up a new national account program 
we expect the difficult conditions encountered in this segment to continue into fiscal corporate corporate expenses  those administrative expenses not allocated to the business segments  were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was due principally to the million pre tax charge in related to the resignation of the company s former chief executive officer announced in september results of discontinued operations as discussed above  on may   the company closed the sale of its educational resources business to knowledge universe corporation for million in cash 
the proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings and the sale resulted in a net gain of million 
the fiscal results of this business are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
sales  operating income and income from discontinued operations for fiscal excluding the net gain through the transaction closing date are as follows fiscal in millions sales income before income taxes income from discontinued operations financial condition and liquidity reference to the consolidated statements of cash flows will facilitate understanding of the discussion that follows 
fiscal cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the principal components in millions of the net increase were increase in net income and noncash charges increase in accounts receivable sale proceeds  due principally to increasing the size of the sale facility reduced working capital requirements although net income increased  net noncash charges depreciation and deferred income taxes decreased approximately million for fiscal compared to the prior year period  due to the lower deferred tax provision 
a recent change in the tax depreciation rules is expected to reduce the annual tax depreciation deduction resulting in the lower deferred tax provision 
the accounts receivable sale facility see note was increased by million in december the lower working capital requirement was due principally to higher current liabilities in  both accounts payable and accrued expenses  reflecting normal payment timing differences including payment of client commissions and income taxes

under the receivables facility  certain subsidiaries of the company transfer without recourse all of their accounts receivable to aramark receivables  llc 
aramark receivables  llc  in turn  has sold and  subject to certain conditions  may from time to time sell an undivided interest in these receivables up to million 
the company amended the receivables facility during the first quarter of fiscal and increased the maximum sale amount from million to million 
the company has retained collection and administrative responsibility for the participating interest sold  and has retained an undivided interest in the transferred receivables of approximately million and million at october  and september   respectively  which is subject to a security interest

aramark may be exposed to liability resulting from the non performance of certain indemnification obligations by an entity currently in bankruptcy from which aramark acquired a business in fiscal the amount of such exposure cannot be quantified at the present time due to uncertainty with respect to the number and amount of claims  if any  originating from or relating to the pre acquisition period

the company believes that it has adequate insurance and other resources to address this matter 
based on the information currently available  and acknowledging the uncertainty of litigation  the september  consolidated balance sheet reflects the amount awarded and the related expected recovery should such liability be confirmed 
such amounts are included in other noncurrent liabilities and other assets  respectively
