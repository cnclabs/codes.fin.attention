item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations  liquidity  capital resources and contractual obligations  as well as discusses our critical accounting policies and estimates 
you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  which are included in this report on form k 
certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below and elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
see risk factors that may affect future results in item in this form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements in this report 
our md a is composed of four major sections  executive summary  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates 
executive summary we are a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focusing primarily on helping patients attain a healthy and youthful appearance and self image through the development and marketing of products in the united states for the treatment of dermatological  aesthetic and podiatric conditions 
we also market products in canada for the treatment of dermatological and aesthetic conditions 
we offer a broad range of products addressing various conditions or aesthetics improvements  including dermal fillers  acne  fungal infections  rosacea  hyperpigmentation  photoaging  psoriasis  eczema  skin and skin structure infections  seborrheic dermatitis and cosmesis improvement in the texture and appearance of skin 
our current product lines are divided between the dermatological and non dermatological fields 
the dermatological field represents products for the treatment of acne and acne related dermatological conditions and non acne dermatological conditions 
the non dermatological field represents products for the treatment of asthma until may  urea cycle disorder and contract revenue 
the acne and acne related dermatological product lines include core brands dynacin  plexion and triaz 
the non acne dermatological product lines include core brands loprox  omnicef  restylane and vanos tm 
the non dermatological product lines include ammonul  buphenyl and orapred 
orapred was one of the company s core brands until it was licensed to biomarin in may the non dermatological field also includes contract revenues associated with licensing and authorized generic agreements 
key aspects of our business we derive a majority of our prescription volume from our core prescription products 
we believe that sales of our core prescription products and sales of our dermal aesthetic product  restylane  which we began selling in the united states on january   will continue to constitute a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future 
we have built our business by executing a four part growth strategy 
this strategy consists of promoting existing core brands  developing new products and important product line extensions  entering into strategic collaborations and acquiring complementary products  technologies and businesses 
as a result of customer buying patterns  a substantial portion of our product revenues has been recognized in the last month of each quarter 
we schedule our inventory purchases to meet anticipated customer demand 
as a result  relatively small delays in the receipt of manufactured products by us could result in revenues being deferred or lost 
our operating expenses are based upon anticipated sales levels  and a high percentage of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
consequently  variations in the timing of revenue recognition could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated periodic earnings shortfalls or losses 

table of contents we estimate customer demand for our prescription products primarily through use of third party syndicated data sources which track prescriptions written by health care providers and dispensed by licensed pharmacies 
the data represents extrapolations from information provided only by certain pharmacies and are estimates of historical demand levels 
we observe trends from these data  and  coupled with certain proprietary information  prepare demand forecasts that are the basis for purchase orders for finished and component inventory from our third party manufacturers and suppliers 
our forecasts may fail to accurately anticipate ultimate customer demand for products 
overestimates of demand may result in excessive inventory production  underestimates may result in inadequate supply of our products in channels of distribution 
we sell our products primarily to major wholesalers and retail pharmacy chains 
consistent with pharmaceutical industry patterns  approximately of our revenues are derived from four major drug wholesale concerns 
while we attempt to estimate inventory levels of our products at our major wholesale customers  using historical prescription information and historical purchase patterns  this process is inherently imprecise 
rarely do wholesale customers provide us complete inventory levels at regional distribution centers  or within their national distribution systems 
we rely wholly upon our wholesale and drug chain customers to effect the distribution allocation of our products 
based upon historically consistent purchasing patterns of our major wholesale customers  we believe our estimates of trade inventory levels of our products are reasonable 
we further believe that inventories of our products among wholesale customers  taken as a whole  are similar to those of other specialty pharmaceutical companies  and that our trade practices  which periodically involve volume discounts and early payment discounts  are typical of the industry 
we periodically offer promotions to wholesale and chain drugstore customers to encourage dispensing of our products  consistent with prescriptions written by licensed health care providers 
because many of our products compete in multi source markets  it is important for us to ensure the licensed health care providers dispensing instructions are fulfilled with our branded products and are not substituted with a generic product or another therapeutic alternative product which may be contrary to the licensed health care providers recommended and prescribed medicis brand 
we believe that a critical component of our brand protection program is maintenance of full product availability at drugstore and wholesale customers 
we believe such availability reduces the probability of local and regional product substitutions  shortages and backorders  which could result in lost sales 
we expect to continue providing favorable terms to wholesale and retail drug chain customers as may be necessary to ensure the fullest possible distribution of our branded products within the pharmaceutical chain of commerce 
we cannot control or significantly influence the purchasing patterns of our wholesale and retail drug chain customers 
they are highly sophisticated customers that purchase products in a manner consistent with their industry practices and  presumably  based upon their projected demand levels 
purchases by any given customer  during any given period  may be above or below actual prescription volumes of any of our products during the same period  resulting in fluctuations of product inventory in the distribution channel 
as described in more detail below  the following significant events and transactions occurred during the fiscal year ended june   and affected our results of operations  our cash flows and our financial condition definitive merger agreement with inamed  fda approval of vanos tm and ammonul  amendment of strategic alliance with aaipharma  amendments of agreements with biomarin  license of proprietary peptide technology from ansata  repurchases of million of class a common stock  license of product rights to taro  license of subq tm from q med  and increase in amount of declared cash dividends

as of september   biomarin has not requested any monies to be advanced under the convertible note  and no amounts are outstanding 
repurchases of common stock in may  our board of directors approved a new repurchase program that authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
this program provided for the repurchase of class a common stock at such times as management determined 
as of june   we had not repurchased any shares of our class a common stock under this program 
in august  our board of directors approved a new program that replaced the may program  which authorized the repurchase of up to million of our class a common stock 
during the first two quarters of fiscal  we purchased a total of  shares of our class a common stock in the open market at an average price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
as the purchase limit had been reached  the plan was terminated during the second quarter of fiscal dividends since the beginning of fiscal  we have paid quarterly cash dividends aggregating approximately million on our common stock 
in addition  on june   we declared a cash dividend of per issued and outstanding share of common stock payable on july  to our stockholders of record at the close of business on july  prior to these dividends  we had not paid a cash dividend on our common stock  and we have not adopted a dividend policy 
any future determinations to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition  operating results  capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 
line of credit we have a revolving line of credit facility of up to million from wells fargo bank  na the facility may be drawn upon by us  at our discretion  and is collateralized by certain short term investments 
any outstanding balance of the credit facility bears interest at a floating rate of basis points in excess of the day london interbank offered rate and expires in november the agreement requires us to comply with certain covenants  including covenants relating to our financial condition and results of operations  we are in compliance with such covenants 
we have not drawn on this credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements as of june   we are not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at june   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at june  or certain other purchase obligations as discussed below in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases other purchase obligations and commitments total contractual obligations interest on long term debt includes interest payable on our old notes and new notes  assuming the old notes and new notes will not have any redemptions or conversions into shares of our class a common stock until their respective maturities in and  but does not include any contingent interest 
the amount of interest ultimately paid in future years could change if any of the old notes or new notes are converted or redeemed and or if contingent interest becomes payable if certain future criteria are met 
other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under research and development and consulting contracts 
we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of certain product development and license agreements 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement and timing of these milestones are not fixed or reasonably determinable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and are not included in the above table 
the total amount of potential future milestone payments related to development and license agreements is approximately million 
purchase orders for raw materials  finished goods and other goods and services are not included in the above table 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purpose of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with relatively short timetables 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or finished goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our short term expected requirements 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principals 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates related to sales allowances  chargebacks  rebates  returns and other pricing adjustments  depreciation and amortization and other contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors related to each circumstance 
actual results could differ from those estimates based upon future events  which could include  among other risks  changes in the regulations governing the manner in which we sell our products  changes in the health care environment and managed care consumption patterns 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are important in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized primarily when the merchandise is shipped to an unrelated third party pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products has occurred  iii the selling price is both fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical wholesalers who sell directly into the retail channel 
we do not provide any forms of price protection to our wholesale customers and permit product returns if the product is damaged  or if it is returned within six months prior to expiration or up to months after expiration 
our customers consist principally of financially viable wholesalers  so  revenue is recorded upon sale to the wholesaler  net of estimated provisions 
we enter into licensing arrangements with other parties whereby we receive contract revenue based on the terms of the agreement 
the timing of revenue recognition is dependent on the level of our continuing involvement in the manufacture and delivery of licensed products 
if we have continuing involvement  the revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of continuing involvement 
in addition  if our licensing arrangements require no continuing involvement and payments are merely based on the passage of time  we will assess such payments for revenue recognition under the collectibility criteria of sab items deducted from gross revenue provisions for estimates for product returns and exchanges  sales discounts  chargebacks  managed care and medicaid rebates and other adjustments are established as a reduction of product sales revenues at the time such revenues are recognized 
these deductions from gross revenue are established by us as our best estimate at the time of sale based on historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
these deductions from gross revenue are generally reflected either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable through an allowance  or as an addition to accrued expenses if the payment is due to a party other than the wholesale or retail customer 
our accounting policies for revenue recognition have a significant impact on our reported results and rely on certain estimates that require complex and subjective judgment on the part of our management 
if the levels of product returns and exchanges  cash discounts  chargebacks  managed care and medicaid rebates and other adjustments fluctuate significantly and or if our estimates do not adequately reserve for these reductions of gross product revenues  our reported net product revenues could be negatively affected 

table of contents product returns and exchanges we account for returns and exchanges of product in accordance with sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists  whereby an allowance is established based on our estimate of revenues recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned in the future 
we determine our estimate of product returns and exchanges based on historical experience and other qualitative factors that could impact the level of future product returns and exchanges 
these factors include estimated shelf life  competitive developments including introductions of generic products  product discontinuations and our introduction of new formulations of our products 
typically  these other factors that influence our allowance for product returns and exchanges do not change significantly from quarter to quarter 
historical experience and the other qualitative factors are assessed on a product specific basis as part of our compilation of our estimate of future product returns and exchanges 
estimates for returns and exchanges of new products are based on historical experience of new products at various stages of their life cycle 
our actual experience and the qualitative factors that we use to determine the necessary allowance for future product returns and exchanges are susceptible to change based on unforeseen events and uncertainties 
we review our allowance for product returns and exchanges quarterly to assess the trends being considered to estimate the allowance  and make changes to the allowance if necessary 
sales discounts we offer cash discounts to our customers as an incentive for prompt payment  generally approximately of the sales price 
we account for cash discounts by establishing an allowance reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts expected to be taken by the customers 
contract chargebacks we have agreements for contract pricing with several entities  whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price 
these parties purchase products through wholesalers at the lower contract price  and the wholesalers charge the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contract price back to us 
we account for chargebacks by establishing an allowance reducing accounts receivable based on our estimate of chargeback claims attributable to a sale 
we determine our estimate of chargebacks based on historical experience and changes to current contract prices 
we also consider our claim processing lag time  and adjust the allowance periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience 
total allowances accounts receivable are presented net of allowances related to the above provisions of approximately million and million at june  and june   respectively 
managed care and medicaid rebates we establish and maintain reserves for amounts payable by us to managed care organizations and state medicaid programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs 
the amounts estimated to be paid relating to products sold are recognized as deductions from gross revenue and as additions to accrued expenses at the time of sale based on our best estimate of the expected prescription fill rate to these managed care and state medicaid patients  using historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves  including changes in formulary status and contractual pricing 
accrued liabilities include reserves of approximately million and million at june  and june   respectively  for estimated managed care and medicaid rebates 
the decrease in the reserves from june  to june  is primarily due to the timing of payments 

table of contents in addition to the significant items deducted from gross revenue described above  we deduct other items from gross revenue 
for example  we offer consumer rebates on many of our products and a consumer loyalty program for our restylane dermal filler product 
we generally account for these other items deducted from gross revenue by establishing an accrual based on our estimate of the adjustments attributable to a sale 
we generally base our estimates for the accrual of these items deducted from gross sales on historical experience and other relevant factors 
we adjust our accruals periodically throughout each quarter based on actual experience and changes in other factors  if any 
we believe that our allowances and accruals for items that are deducted from gross revenue are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
however  it is possible that other parties applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different allowance and accrual amounts for items that are deducted from gross revenue 
additionally  changes in actual experience or changes in other qualitative factors could cause our allowances and accruals to fluctuate 
a five percent change in the expenses related to the allowances and accruals described above would lead to an approximate million annual effect on our income before income tax expense  based on the amount of expense we recognized during fiscal related to the allowances and accruals described above 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets we have in the past made acquisitions of products and businesses that include goodwill  license agreements  product rights  and other identifiable intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following i significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and iii significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we first will perform an assessment of the asset s recoverability based on expected undiscounted future net cash flow and  if the amount is less than the asset s value  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
we are required to perform an annual impairment review  and more frequently under certain circumstances 
goodwill is subjected to this test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
the impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if we determine through the impairment process that goodwill has been impaired  we will record the impairment charge in the statement of income 
as of june   there was no impairment charge related to goodwill 
there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
as a result of our acquisitions  we included approximately million and million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets as of june  and june   respectively 
as a result of our acquisitions of product rights and other identifiable intangible assets  we have included approximately million and million as net intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets as of june  and june   respectively 
estimated amortization expense for other identifiable intangible assets as of june  is approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   approximately million for the fiscal years ended june  and june   approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   and approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  income taxes income taxes are determined using an annual effective tax rate  which is generally less than the us federal statutory rate  primarily because of tax exempt interest  charitable contribution deductions and research and experimentation tax credits available in the united states 
our effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuations during the fiscal year as new information is obtained which may affect the assumptions we use to estimate our annual 
table of contents effective tax rate  including factors such as our mix of pre tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  reserves for tax audit issues and settlements  utilization of research and experimentation tax credits and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct operations 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying value to an amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
based on the company s historical pre tax earnings  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefit of the existing net deferred tax assets at june  management believes the existing net deductible temporary differences will reverse during periods in which the company generates net taxable income  however  there can be no assurance that the company will generate any earnings or any specific level of continuing earnings in future years 
certain tax planning or other strategies could be implemented  if necessary  to supplement income from operations to fully realize recorded tax benefits 
deferred income taxes are presented net of a valuation allowance of approximately million as of june  and june  the valuation allowance relates to attributes acquired in the merger with ascent that will not be realized based on the statutory limitations under the change in control provisions of the internal revenue code 
research and development costs and accounting for strategic collaborations all research and development costs  including payments related to products under development and research consulting agreements  are expensed as incurred 
we may continue to make up front  non refundable payments to third parties for new technologies and for research and development work that has been completed 
these up front payments may be expensed at the time of payment depending on the nature of the payment made 
our policy on accounting for costs of strategic collaborations determines the timing of our recognition of certain development costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classified as development expense or capitalized as an asset 
we are required to form judgments with respect to the commercial status of such products in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
for example  when we acquire certain products for which there is already an anda or nda available  and there is net realizable value based on projected sales for these products  we capitalize the amount paid as an intangible asset 
in addition  if we acquire product rights that are in the development phase and as to which we have no assurance that the third party is required to perform additional research efforts  we expense such payments 
during fiscal years  and  we incurred and expensed approximately million  million and million  respectively  of up front or development milestone payments related to research and development collaborations 
of the million expensed during fiscal  approximately million were professional fees incurred related to the completion of the collaboration agreements  and were included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
effects of recently issued accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb approved the consensus reached on the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
the issue s objective is to provide guidance for identifying other than temporarily impaired investments 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position eitf that delays the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance in eitf until further notice 
the disclosure requirements of eitf are effective with this annual report for fiscal once the fasb reaches a final decision on the measurement and recognition provisions  we will evaluate the impact of the adoption of the accounting provisions of eitf at its meeting on september   the eitf reached a final consensus  eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share eitf no 
 that the dilutive effect of contingently convertible instruments coco s must be included in dilutive earnings per share regardless 
table of contents of whether the triggering contingency based on the market price of the issuer s shares has been satisfied 
this change in accounting principle was applied on a retroactive basis and required restatement of prior period dilutive earnings per share 
this eitf issue is effective for all periods ending after december  the eitf issue resulted in an additional approximately million shares of dilution to the company s diluted earnings per share calculation due to the company s and senior convertible debentures  which are coco s 
during december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
stock based payments include stock option grants 
we grant options to purchase common stock to some of our employees and directors under various plans at prices equal to the market value of the stock on the dates the options were granted 
we currently account for stock options using the method prescribed in accounting principals board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb opinion no 
whereby stock options are granted at market price and no compensation cost is recognized  and disclose the pro forma effect on net earnings assuming compensation cost had been recognized in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
r  which is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using prescribed fair value based methods 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a a modified prospective method in which compensation costs are recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date  and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date or b a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits companies to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either for all periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we have decided to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method and expect such adoption will have an unfavorable impact on our consolidated results of operations and net income per common share 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
in october  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on issue  accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination  eitf no 
requires that a business combination between two parties that have a preexisting relationship be evaluated to determine if a settlement of a preexisting relationship exists 
eitf no 
also requires that certain reacquired rights including the rights to the acquirer s trade name under a franchise agreement be recognized as intangible assets apart from goodwill 
however  if a contract giving rise to the reacquired rights includes terms that are favorable or unfavorable when compared to pricing for current market transactions for the same or similar items  eitf no 
requires that a settlement gain or loss should be measured as the lesser of a the amount by which the contract is favorable or unfavorable under market terms from the perspective of the acquirer or b the stated settlement provisions of the contract available to the counterparty to which the contract is unfavorable 
eitf no 
is effective prospectively for business combinations consummated in reporting periods beginning after october  eitf no 
will apply to the merger with inamed 
the amount and timing of any such gains or losses the company might record is dependent upon what the company acquires and when the merger is consummated 
the company currently expects to record a charge of million related to the settlement of certain litigation with inamed 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our investment portfolio  consisting of fixed income securities that we hold on an available for sale basis  was approximately million as of june   and million as of june  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates increase

we have not entered into derivative financial instruments 
we have minimal operations outside of the united states and  accordingly  we have not been susceptible to significant risk from changes in foreign currencies 
during the normal course of business we could be subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations  as we discussed above  and collectibility of accounts receivable 
we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future
