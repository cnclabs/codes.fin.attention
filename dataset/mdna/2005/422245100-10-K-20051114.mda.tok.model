as of august   we had contracts with health plans to provide disease management and care enhancement program services to their eligible members and also had contracts to provide our services at hospitals 
in december  we were selected by cms to participate in two medicare health support mhs pilots awarded under the chronic care improvement program authorized by the medicare modernization act of we began operating one pilot in august to serve  medicare fee for service beneficiaries in maryland and the district of columbia 
in addition  in september we began serving  beneficiaries in georgia in collaboration with cigna healthcare  inc both of the pilots are for complex diabetes and congestive heart failure disease management services and are operationally similar to our programs for commercial and medicare advantage health plan populations 
on june  we acquired certain assets from health iq diagnostics  llc health iq  a health support company that uses a proprietary model to provide enrollees of employer sponsored health plans and their dependents with a personal health risk score as well as the information they need to maintain or improve their health status 
we have seen increasing demand for our health and care support services from health plans administrative services only aso customers 
aso customers are typically self insured employers for which our health plan customers do not assume medical cost risk but provide primarily administrative claim and health network access services 
signed contracts between these self insured employers and our health plan customers are incorporated in our contracts with our health plan customers  and these program eligible members are included in actual lives under management or annualized revenue in backlog  as appropriate 
highlights of fiscal performance revenues increased over fiscal net income increased over fiscal actual lives under management increased from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal  which included a increase in self insured employer actual lives under management to  at the end of fiscal from  at the end of fiscal management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contains forward looking statements  which are based upon current expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties

in order for us to use the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we caution you that the following important factors  among others  may affect these forward looking statements

the important factors include  but are not limited to  our ability to sign and implement new contracts for health and care support services  our ability to accurately forecast performance and the timing of revenue recognition under the terms of our health plan contracts and or our cooperative agreement with cms ahead of data collection and reconciliation in order to provide forward looking guidance  the timing and costs of implementation  and the effect  of regulations and interpretations relating to the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  our ability to anticipate the rate of market acceptance of health and care support solutions and the individual market dynamics in potential international markets and our ability to accurately forecast the costs necessary to implement our strategy of establishing a presence in these markets  our ability to effectively manage any growth that we might experience  our ability to retain existing customers if they are acquired by other health plans which already have or are not interested in health and care support programs  the risks associated with a significant concentration of our revenues with a limited number of customers  our ability to effect cost savings and clinical outcomes improvements under health and care support contracts and reach mutual agreement with customers and or cms with respect to cost savings  or to effect such savings and improvements within the time frames contemplated by us  our ability to collect contractually earned performance incentive bonuses  the ability of our customers and or cms to provide timely and accurate data that is essential to the operation and measurement of our performance under the terms of our health plan contracts  our ability to favorably resolve contract billing and interpretation issues with our customers  our ability to integrate the operations of health iq and other acquired businesses or technologies into our business  our ability to develop new products and deliver outcomes on those products  our ability to effectively integrate new technologies and approaches  such as those encompassed in our health and care support initiatives or otherwise licensed or acquired by us  into our health and care support platform  our ability to renew and or maintain contracts with our customers under existing terms or restructure these contracts on terms that would not have a material negative impact on our results of operations  our ability to implement our health and care support strategy within expected cost estimates  our ability to obtain adequate financing to provide the capital that may be necessary to support the growth of our operations and to support or guarantee our performance under new contracts  unusual and unforeseen patterns of health care utilization by individuals with diabetes  cardiac  respiratory and or other diseases or conditions for which we provide services  in the health plans with which we have executed a health and care support contract  the ability of the health plans to maintain the number of covered lives enrolled in the plans during the terms of our agreements with the health plans  our ability to attract and or retain and effectively manage the employees required to implement our agreements  the impact of litigation involving us and or our subsidiaries  the impact of future state and federal health care and other applicable legislation and regulations on our ability to deliver our services and on the financial health of our customers and their willingness to purchase our services  current geopolitical turmoil and the continuing threat of domestic or international terrorism  general worldwide and domestic economic conditions and stock market volatility  and other risks detailed in this annual report on form k 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise any such forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies we describe our accounting policies in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition we generally determine our contract fees by multiplying a contractually negotiated rate per health plan member per month pmpm by the number of health plan members covered by our services during the month 
we set the pmpm rates during contract negotiations with customers based on the value we expect our programs to create and a sharing of that value between the customer and the company 
in some contracts  the pmpm rates may differ between the health plan s lines of business eg  ppo  hmo  medicare advantage  aso 
contracts with health plans generally range from three to seven years with provisions for subsequent renewal  contracts between our health plan customers and their aso customers typically have one year terms 
some contracts provide that a portion up to of our fees may be refundable to the customer performance based if our programs do not achieve  when compared to a baseline year  a targeted percentage reduction in the customer s health care costs and selected clinical and or other criteria that focus on improving the health of the members 
approximately of revenues recorded during the year ended august  were performance based and remain subject to final reconciliation 
we anticipate that this percentage will fluctuate due to the level of performance based fees in new contracts  revenue recognition associated with performance based fees  and the timing of data reconciliation  which varies according to contract terms 
a limited number of contracts also provide opportunities for us to receive incentive bonuses in excess of the contractual pmpm rate if we exceed contractual performance targets 
we bill our customers each month for the entire amount of the fees contractually due for the prior month s enrollment  which typically includes the amount  if any  that is performance based and may be subject to refund should we not meet performance targets 
contractually  we cannot bill for any incentive bonus until after contract settlement 
we recognize revenue as follows we recognize the fixed portion of the monthly fees as revenue during the period we perform our services  we recognize the performance based portion of the monthly fees based on our performance to date in the contract year  and we recognize additional incentive bonuses based on our performance to date in the contract year  to the extent we consider such amounts collectible 
we assess our level of performance based on medical claims and other data that the health plan customer is contractually required to supply each month 
a minimum of four to six months data is typically required for us to measure performance 
in assessing our performance  we may include estimates such as medical claims incurred but not reported and a health plan s medical cost trend compared to a baseline year 
in addition  we may also provide contractual reserves  when appropriate  for billing adjustments at contract reconciliation 
if data from the health plan is insufficient or incomplete to measure performance  or interim performance measures indicate that we are not meeting performance targets  we do not recognize performance based fees as revenues but instead record them in a current liability account contract billings in excess of earned revenue 
only in the event we do not meet performance levels by the end of the contract year are we contractually obligated to refund some or all of the performance based fees 
we would only reverse revenues that we had already recognized if performance to date in the contract year  previously above targeted levels  dropped below targeted levels due to subsequent adverse performance and or adjustments in contractual reserves 
historically  any such adjustments have been immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations 
during the settlement process under a contract  which generally occurs six to eight months after the end of a contract year  we settle any performance based fees and reconcile health care claims and clinical data 
as of august   performance based fees that have not yet been settled with our customers but that have been recognized as revenue in the current and prior years totaled approximately million 
of this amount  million was based entirely on actual data received from our customers  while million was based on calculations which include estimates such as medical claims incurred but not reported and a health plan s medical cost trend compared to a baseline year 
data reconciliation differences  for which we provide contractual allowances until we reach agreement with respect to identified issues  can arise between the customer and us due to health plan data deficiencies  omissions  and or data discrepancies 
performance related adjustments including any amounts recorded as revenue that were ultimately refunded  changes in estimates  data reconciliation differences  or adjustments to incentive bonuses may cause us to recognize or reverse revenue in a current fiscal year that pertains to services provided during the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal  we recognized a net increase in revenue of million that related to services provided prior to fiscal impairment of intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill is impaired based upon an impairment review  we calculate any impairment using a fair value based goodwill impairment test as required by sfas no 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between two willing parties 
we estimate fair value using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
we amortize other identifiable intangible assets  such as acquired technologies and customer contracts  on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  except for trade names  which have an indefinite life and are not subject to amortization 
we review intangible assets not subject to amortization on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
we assess the potential impairment of intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
if we determine that the carrying value of other identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable  we calculate any impairment using an estimate of the asset s fair value based on the projected net cash flows expected to result from that asset  including eventual disposition 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
business strategy our primary strategy is to develop new and to expand existing relationships with health plans and cms to provide health and care support programs and services  including creating value for large self insured employers 
we plan to use our scaleable state of the art care enhancement centers and medical information content and proprietary technologies to gain a competitive advantage in delivering our health and care support services 
we expect to continue adding services to our product mix that extend our programs beyond a chronic disease focus and provide services to individuals who currently have  or face the risk of developing  one or more additional medical conditions 
we believe that we can achieve improvements in care  and therefore significant cost savings  by addressing care and treatment requirements for these additional selected diseases and conditions  which will enable us to address a larger percentage of a health plan s population and total health care costs 
in addition  we expect to continue developing proprietary  proactive health support for whole populations across the continuum of care  including next generation wellness solutions 
we anticipate that we will incur significant costs during fiscal to enhance and expand our clinical programs and data and financial reporting systems  pursue opportunities in international markets  enhance our information technology support  and open additional or expand current care enhancement centers as needed 
we may add some of these new capabilities and technologies through strategic alliances with other entities  one or more of which we may make minority investments in or acquire for stock and or cash 
results of operations the following table shows the components of the statements of operations for the years ended august   and expressed as a percentage of revenues 
year ended august  revenues cost of services gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income revenues revenues for fiscal and fiscal increased and  respectively  over the prior fiscal years 
fiscal revenues increased over fiscal revenues primarily due to the following an increase in self insured employer actual lives under management from  at august  to  at august   existing health plan customers adding or expanding programs since august   and the commencement of new health plan contracts since august  increased membership in customers existing programs 
excluding statusone health systems  llc statusone revenues of million in fiscal  revenues would have increased in fiscal compared to fiscal excluding the acquisition of statusone  fiscal revenues increased over fiscal primarily due to the following an increase in self insured employer actual lives under management from  at august  to  at august   existing health plan customers adding or expanding programs since august   the commencement of new health plan contracts since august   and increased membership in customers existing programs 
in addition  the increase in revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was also partially attributable to the renegotiation of one contract at the beginning of fiscal for which we did not recognize any revenue in fiscal because we were unable to measure performance due to contracting terms and outcomes measurement provisions unique to this contract 
we anticipate that fiscal revenues will increase over fiscal revenues primarily due to the expansion of existing contracts  increasing demand for our health and care support services from self insured employers who contract with our health plan customers  anticipated new contracts  and revenues from mhs pilots 
cost of services cost of services as a percentage of revenues increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal excluding contract performance incentive bonus revenues  which totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  cost of services as a percentage of revenues would have increased to from for fiscal and  respectively  primarily as a result of an increase in accrued employee bonuses and increased expenses related to securing and preparing for mhs pilots during fiscal compared to fiscal these increases were partially offset by decreases attributable to initial operating costs in fiscal related to the opening of two new care enhancement centers in january and march and increased capacity utilization  economies of scale  and productivity enhancements during fiscal compared to fiscal cost of services as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal excluding contract performance incentive bonus revenues  which decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  cost of services as a percentage of revenues would have decreased to from for fiscal and  respectively  primarily as a result of increased capacity utilization  economies of scale  and productivity enhancements  as well as a lower employee bonus accrual in fiscal over fiscal because we did not achieve certain internal targets in fiscal on which the employee bonus was based 
we anticipate that fiscal cost of services will increase over fiscal primarily as a result of share based payments required to be expensed under sfas no 
r  share based payment  and other long term employee incentive costs  anticipated investments in international initiatives  operating costs related to the mhs pilots  increased operating staff required for expected increases in demand for our services  increased indirect staff costs associated with the continuing development and implementation of our health and care support services  and increases in information technology and other support staff and costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily due to our ability to more effectively leverage our selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of growth in our operations 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in accrued employee bonuses and increased expenses related to securing and preparing for mhs pilots during fiscal compared to the fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal excluding contract performance incentive bonus revenues  which decreased million for fiscal compared to fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues would have decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in costs related to marketing and branding campaigns  partially offset by a million increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the grant  which was subject to stockholder approval  of stock options to two new directors of the company in june such approval was obtained at the annual meeting of stockholders in january  at which time the options were issued 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal will increase over fiscal primarily due to share based payments required to be expensed under sfas no 
r and other long term employee incentive costs  anticipated investments in international initiatives  operating costs related to the mhs pilots  and increased indirect support costs for our existing and anticipated new and expanded health plan contracts 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal increased over fiscal primarily due to increased depreciation expense associated with equipment  software  leasehold improvements  and computer related capital expenditures 
we made these capital expenditures to enhance our health plan information technology capabilities and expand our corporate office and calling capacity at existing care enhancement centers 
depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal increased over fiscal primarily due to amortization expense related to statusone intangible assets and increased depreciation expense associated with equipment  software development  leasehold improvements  and computer related capital expenditures 
we made these capital expenditures to enhance our health plan information technology capabilities  open two new care enhancement centers  and expand our corporate office and one existing care enhancement center during fiscal we anticipate that depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal will increase over fiscal primarily as a result of additional capital expenditures associated with expected increases in demand for our services and growth and improvement in our information technology capabilities 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal primarily due to a reduction in our long term debt balance resulting from net repayments of million of revolving debt since october   as well as lower interest rates under the first amended and restated revolving credit loan agreement dated october  the first amended credit agreement compared to the revolving credit and term loan agreement dated september  the former credit agreement described more fully in liquidity and capital resources below 
interest expense for fiscal increased million compared to fiscal primarily due to interest costs related to a million term loan incurred in connection with the acquisition of statusone  offset slightly by decreased fees associated with a reduction in outstanding letters of credit to support certain contractual requirements to repay fees in the event we do not perform at target levels and do not repay the fees due in accordance with the contract terms 
we anticipate that interest expense for fiscal will decrease over fiscal primarily as a result of a lower balance of long term debt 
income tax expense our effective tax rate decreased to for fiscal compared to and for fiscal and  respectively  primarily as a result of our geographic mix of earnings  which impacts our average state income tax rate  and other factors 
the differences between the statutory federal income tax rate of and our effective tax rate are due primarily to the impact of state income taxes and certain non deductible expenses for income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased million during fiscal to million at august  from million at august  the increase was primarily due to cash flow from operations partially offset by capital expenditures and net payments of long term debt 
operating activities for fiscal generated cash of million compared to million for fiscal the increase in operating cash flow of million resulted primarily from an increase in net income and an increase in accrued employee bonuses  the payment of which generally occurs in the first quarter of the following fiscal year 
these increases to cash flow from operations were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable related to the timing of capital expenditures at the end of fiscal for upgrades to hardware and increased estimated income tax payments of million for fiscal compared to fiscal investing activities during fiscal used million in cash which primarily consisted of investments in property and equipment of million 
this amount was partially offset by the return to the company of million that was previously held in escrow in connection with the statusone acquisition and net proceeds from the purchase and sale of investments of million 
the purchase of property and equipment was primarily associated with enhancements in our information technology capabilities and the expansion of an existing care enhancement center 
financing activities for fiscal used million in cash primarily due to net payments on long term debt of million  deferred loan costs related to the first amended credit agreement of million  and funding of an escrow account of million in conjunction with contractual requirements under one contract 
these uses of cash were slightly offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million 
on september   we amended and restated the first amended credit agreement and entered into the second amended and restated revolving credit loan agreement the second amended credit agreement 
the second amended credit agreement provides us with a million revolving credit facility  including a swingline sub facility of million and a million sub facility for letters of credit  together with an uncommitted incremental accordion facility of million  and expires on september  the second amended credit agreement requires us to repay the principal on any loans at the maturity date of september  borrowings under the second amended credit agreement generally bear interest  at our option  at libor plus a spread of to or at the prime rate 
the second amended credit agreement also provides for a fee ranging between and of unused commitments 
the second amended credit agreement is secured by guarantees from the company s active domestic subsidiaries and by security interests in substantially all of the company s and its subsidiaries assets 
the first amended credit agreement provided us with up to million in borrowing capacity and contained various financial covenants  which required us to maintain  as defined  ratios or levels of i total funded debt to ebitda  ii interest coverage  iii fixed charge coverage  and iv net worth 
the second amended credit agreement contains similar financial covenants with the exclusion of the interest coverage ratio 
both agreements restrict the payment of dividends and limit the amount of repurchases of the company s common stock 
as of august   we were in compliance with all of the covenant requirements of the first amended credit agreement  and we are currently in compliance with all of the covenant requirements of the second amended credit agreement 
as of august   our available line of credit totaled million 
on september   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our interest rate exposure under the former credit agreement 
in september  in anticipation of amending and restating our former credit agreement by entering into the first amended credit agreement  we terminated the interest rate swap agreement and recognized a gain of approximately  as of august   there were letters of credit outstanding under the second amended credit agreement totaling million primarily to support our requirement to repay fees under one health plan contract in the event we do not perform at established target levels and do not repay the fees due in accordance with the terms of the contract 
in conjunction with contractual requirements under one contract beginning on march   we funded an escrow account in the amount of approximately million 
we were required to deposit a percentage of all fees received from this customer during the first year of the contract into the escrow account to be used to repay fees under the contract in the event we do not perform at established target levels 
we believe that cash flow from operating activities  our available cash  and our available credit under the second amended credit agreement will continue to enable us to meet our contractual obligations and to fund the current level of growth in our operations for the foreseeable future 
however  if expanding our operations requires significant additional financing resources  such as capital expenditures for technology improvements  additional care enhancement centers and or letters of credit or other forms of financial assurance to guarantee our performance under the terms of new contracts  or if we are required to refund performance based fees pursuant to contract terms  we may need to raise additional capital by expanding our existing credit facility and or issuing debt or equity 
if we face a limited ability to arrange such financing  it may restrict our ability to expand our operations 
in addition  if contract development accelerates or acquisition opportunities arise that would expand our operations  we may need to issue additional debt or equity to provide the funding for these increased growth opportunities 
we may also issue equity in connection with future acquisitions or strategic alliances 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to issue additional debt or equity on terms that would be acceptable to us 
contractual obligations the following schedule summarizes our contractual cash obligations by the indicated period as of august  payments due by year ended august  in s and after total capital lease obligations deferred compensation plan payments     operating lease obligations     other contractual cash obligations    total contractual cash obligations      other commitments represent cash payments in connection with our strategic alliance agreements and exclude certain variable costs related to one strategic alliance that are based on the number of future eligible members 
recently issued accounting standards consolidation of variable interest entities in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation fin no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
r requires consolidation of variable interest entities if certain conditions are met and generally applies to periods ending after march  the adoption of fin no 
r did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
share based payment in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate  based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures  either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we adopted statement r on september  using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by statement  prior to september  we accounted for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we expect that adopting sfas no 
r will reduce fiscal earnings per share by per diluted share 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of amounts recognized as compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than an operating cash flow as required under previous accounting guidance 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what the benefits of these tax deductions will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  we recognized million and million of such amounts in cash flow from operating activities for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk related to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of the second amended credit agreement  the first amended credit agreement  and the former credit agreement  which bear interest based on floating rates 
borrowings under the former credit agreement bore interest  at our option  at the prime rate plus a spread of to or libor plus a spread of to  or a combination thereof 
borrowings under the first amended credit agreement bore interest  at our option  at the prime rate plus a spread of to or libor plus a spread of to  or a combination thereof 
borrowings under the second amended credit agreement generally bear interest  at our option  at libor plus a spread of to or at the prime rate 
we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
a one point interest rate change on the variable rate debt outstanding during fiscal would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately million for the year ended august
