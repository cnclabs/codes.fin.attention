critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for credit losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheets 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the credit risk management section of this financial review 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting policies adopted by the company during and the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity  the impacts are discussed in the applicable section s of this financial review and notes to the consolidated financial statements

interest income on loans includes amortized loan fees  net of costs  for each category and yields are stated to include all 
the company s tax equivalent yield on loans continued to decline in as new loans and loans refinanced with the company were recorded at lower rates than the year before 
an increased volume of loans during resulted in an increase in interest income for the year when compared to  when the effect of declining rates was much greater than the impact of loan volume on the resultant interest income 
in  the increased volume of loans generated  in additional interest income  which was offset by a  decline in interest income due to the reduced yields

provision for credit losses and risk management originating loans involves a degree of risk that credit losses will occur in varying amounts according to  among other factors  the types of loans being made  the credit worthiness of the borrowers over the term of the loans  the quality of the collateral for the loan  if any  as well as general economic conditions 
the company s board of directors demands accountability of management  keeping the interests of stockholders in focus 
through its asset liability and audit committees  the board actively reviews critical risk positions  including market  credit  liquidity and operational risk 
the company s goal in managing risk is to reduce earnings volatility  control exposure to unnecessary risk  and ensure appropriate returns for risk assumed 
senior members of management actively manage risk at the product level  supplemented with corporate level oversight through the asset liability committee and internal audit function 
the risk management structure is designed to identify risk issues through a systematic process  enabling timely and appropriate action to avoid and mitigate risk 
credit risk management the company s loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk is mitigated through portfolio diversification  limiting exposure to any single industry or customer  collateral protection and standard lending policies and underwriting criteria 
the following discussion provides information and statistics on the overall quality of the company s loan portfolio 
note to consolidated financial statements describes the accounting policies related to nonperforming loans and charge offs and describes the methodologies used to develop the allowance for credit losses  including both the specific and nonspecific components 
management believes the policies governing nonperforming loans and charge offs are consistent with regulatory standards 
the amount of the allowance for credit losses and the resulting provision are reviewed monthly by senior members of management and approved quarterly by the board of directors 
the allowance is increased by provisions for credit losses charged to expense and recoveries of loans previously charged off 
it is decreased by loans charged off in the current period 
provisions for credit losses are made to bring the allowance for credit losses within the range of balances that are considered appropriate based upon the allowance methodology and to reflect losses within the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is determined based upon management s estimate of the inherent risks associated with lending activities  estimated fair value of collateral  past experience and present indicators such as loan delinquency trends  nonaccrual loans and current market conditions 
management believes the allowance is adequate  however  future changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and financial condition of borrowers may result in additions to the allowance 
examination of the portfolio and allowance by various regulatory agencies and consultants engaged by the company may result in the need for additional provisions based upon information available at the time of the examination 
each of the banks maintains a separate allowance for credit losses  which is only available to absorb losses from their respective loan portfolios 
each banks allowance is subject to regulatory examination and determination as to its adequacy 
the allowance for credit losses is comprised of two parts the specific allowance and the formula allowance 
the specific allowance is the portion of the allowance that results from management s evaluation of specific loss allocations for identified problem loans and pooled reserves based on historical loss experience for each loan category 
the formula allowance is determined based on management s assessment of industry trends and economic factors in the markets in which the company operates 
the determination of the formula allowance involves a higher risk of uncertainty and considers current risk factors that may not have yet manifested themselves in the company s historical loss factors 
the specific allowance is based on each banks quarterly analysis of its loan portfolio and is determined based upon the analysis of collateral values  cash flows and guarantor s financial capacity  whichever are applicable 
in addition  allowance factors are applied to internally classified loans for which specific allowances have not been determined and historical loss factors are applied to homogenous pools of unclassified loans 
historical loss factors may be adjusted by management in situations where no historical losses have occurred or where current conditions are not reflective of the specific history of the company 
the formula allowance is based upon management s evaluation of external conditions  the effects of which are not directly measured in the determination of the specific allowance 
the conditions evaluated in connection with the formula allowance include general economic and business conditions affecting the company s primary lending area  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan values  loan volumes and concentrations  seasoning of the loan portfolio  specific industry conditions within the portfolio segments  recent loss experience  duration of the current business cycle  bank regulatory examination results  and findings of internal loan review personnel 
management reviews the conditions which impact the formula allowance quarterly and to the extent any of these conditions relate to specifically identifiable loans may reflect the adjustment in the specific allowance 
where any of these conditions is not related to a specific loan or loan category  management s evaluation of the probable loss related to the condition is reflected in the formula allowance 
while the local economy does not appear to show signs of weakness or the effects of the recent recession exhibited elsewhere in the nation  management is aware that the effects of continued weakness in the national economy and or a weakness in the local economy could result in future higher loss levels for the company 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans was 
in  compared to 
in at december   the allowance for credit losses was  or 
of average outstanding loans  and of total nonaccrual loans 
this compares to an allowance of  or 
of average outstanding loans and of nonaccrual loans  at december   and an allowance for credit losses of  or 
of outstanding loans and of nonaccrual loans  at december  management s decision regarding the amount of the provision is influenced in part by growth in commercial and real estate loan balances 
the company experienced higher levels of charge offs during than it had experienced during the prior five years 
charge offs were  in  compared to  in and  in charge offs were  and  in and  respectively

the provision for credit losses was  for the year  compared to  for the amount of the provision is determined based upon management s analysis of the portfolio  growth and changes in the condition of credits and their resultant specific loss allocations 
historically  the company has experienced the majority of its losses in the commercial loan portfolio  which are typically not secured by real estate 
because the majority of loan growth is in loans secured by real estate  which have experienced minimal losses over the past five years  the required allowance for those type of loans is minimal compared to the amount required for non real estate secured commercial loans 
net charge offs during were  compared to  during and the increase relates primarily to losses identified in december attributable to a single commercial loan relationship 
the allowance increased  or  of which  is due to the acquisition of felton bank 
during  the allowance decreased  or  totaling  or 
of total loans at december  the overall quality of the loan portfolio was strong at december   with nonaccrual loans and delinquencies within acceptable levels for the industry 
there was no unallocated portion of the allowance at december   compared to of the total allowance at december  the allowance pertaining to commercial  financial and agricultural loans represented of the total allowance at december   compared to at december  the decline is attributable in part to the improved condition of several large commercial customers  the recognition of previously identified losses  and improved underwriting practices 
the amount of the reserve allocated to real estate mortgage loans decreased from at december  to at december  growth in the allowance in is concentrated in the commercial and construction loan categories as these types of loans have more risk than consumer and commercial real estate secured loans 
the company s loans are primarily made in kent  queen anne s  talbot  caroline and dorchester counties in maryland and in kent county  delaware 
real estate mortgage loans represented of the portfolio at december   compared to at december  the company has experienced relatively low historical losses with respect to these loans as a result of underlying collateral values  its substantial experience in the markets it serves  and its conservative lending practices 
real estate secured construction and land development loans increased to of the total loan portfolio at december   compared to one year ago 
the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for credit losses and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans for the years ended december  dollars in thousands amount amount amount amount amount commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer unallocated market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates or equity pricing 
the company s principal market risk is interest rate risk that arises from its lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
the company s profitability is dependent on the banks net interest income 
interest rate risk can significantly affect net interest income to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different intervals than interest earning assets 
the banks asset liability committees oversee the management of interest rate risk 
the primary purpose of these committees is to manage the exposure of net interest margins to unexpected changes due to interest rate fluctuations 
these efforts affect the loan pricing and deposit rate policies of the company as well as the asset mix  volume guidelines  and liquidity and capital planning 
the company does not utilize derivative financial or commodity instruments or hedging strategies in its management of interest rate risk 
since the company is not exposed to market risk from trading activities and does not utilize hedging strategies or off balance sheet management strategies  the asset liability committees of the banks rely on gap analysis as its primary tool in managing interest rate risk 
gap analysis summarizes the amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  which will reprice over various time intervals 
the difference between the volume of assets and liabilities repricing in each interval is the interest sensitivity gap 
positive gap occurs when more assets reprice in a given time interval  while negative gap occurs when more liabilities reprice 
as of december   the company had a negative gap position within the one year repricing interval because the interest sensitive liabilities exceeded the interest sensitive assets within the one year repricing interval by million  or of total assets 
rates paid for interest bearing liabilities reached their theoretical floors during  but currently offered rates for time deposits began to increase during the second half of the year 
as of december   the company likewise had a negative gap position within the one year repricing interval because the interest sensitive liabilities exceeded the interest sensitive assets within the one year repricing interval by million  or of total assets 
the following table summarizes the company s interest sensitivity at december  loans  federal funds sold  time deposits and short term borrowings are classified based upon contractual maturities if fixed rate or earliest repricing date if variable rate

the model takes into consideration the effect of call features of investments as well as prepayments of loans in periods of declining rates 
when actual changes in interest rates occur  the changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may differ from the assumptions used in the model 
as of december  and  the models produced similar sensitivity profiles for net interest income and the fair value of capital  which are provided below

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
the company generally requires collateral or other security to support the financial instruments with credit risk 
the amount of collateral or other security is determined based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
letters of credit and other commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the letters of credit and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements
