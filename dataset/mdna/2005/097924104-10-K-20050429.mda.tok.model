restatement of previously issued financial statements during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began an evaluation of our lease accounting practices and determined that it was appropriate to restate previously issued financial statements 
historically  we have recognized store lease expense on a straight line basis beginning on the date that the store opened 
this generally had the effect of excluding the pre opening store build out  fixturing and merchandise stocking periods during which the company typically had no rent payments 
based upon our evaluation of our lease accounting practices  we have adopted an accounting policy to capitalize rent during the construction period and recognize straight line rent expense upon the store becoming substantially complete and ready for its intended use  which results in us recording rent expense during the merchandise stocking periods 
additionally  in prior periods  we reflected proceeds from landlord construction allowances as a separately identified component of cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
we have restated our historical fiscal and fiscal consolidated statements of cash flows to reflect such proceeds as a component of cash flows from operating activities 
the restatement includes adjustments to cost of sales  buying and store occupancy costs  income loss before income taxes  provision benefit for income taxes  net income loss and earnings loss per share 
these changes increased net loss and loss per share by  and 
per diluted share in the first three quarters of fiscal the restatement adjustments decreased net income and earnings per share in fiscal by  and 
per diluted share  and increased net income and earnings per share in fiscal by  and 
per diluted share 
although the restatement did not impact any net cash flows for any period presented  it did have the effect of increasing operating cash flows and increasing investing cash flows by a similar amount 
these changes increased net cash provided by operating activities and increased our net cash used in investing activities in fiscal and fiscal by million and million  respectively 
the restatement also affects periods prior to fiscal the impact of the restatement on such prior periods has been reflected as a reduction of  or less than  to total stockholders equity as of february  in the accompanying consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity 
we have also restated the applicable financial information for fiscal  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal in item  selected financial data 
for information with respect to the restatement adjustments  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
this management s discussion and analysis gives effect to these restatements 
the restatement relating to the reflection of proceeds from landlord construction allowances as a component of cash flows from operating activities increased our net cash provided by operating activities and increased our net cash used in investing activities in the three  six and nine month interim periods of fiscal by 
million  million and million  respectively  and increased our net cash provided by used in operating activities and increased our net cash in investing activities in the nine month interim period of fiscal by million 
executive overview bombay designs  sources and markets a line of proprietary home furnishings that includes large furniture  occasional furniture  wall decor and decorative accessories that is timeless  transitional and classic in its styling 
more than of the items are imported from approximately countries worldwide  with more than half of the product coming from china 
we are a multi channel retailer with store locations  internet and mail order operations 
we have a small wholesale operation that is immaterial to overall revenue but contributes incrementally to profitability 
we focus on several key metrics in managing and evaluating our operating performance and financial condition including the following same store sales  sales and gross margins by merchandise categories  operating margins as a percentage of revenues  earnings per share  cash flow  return on assets and inventory turn 
we are currently executing a multi phase turnaround intended to improve bombay s long term profitability and generate competitive operating results in line with current market leaders in the sector whose operating profits are in the to range 
fiscal was an investment year during which many structural issues were addressed 
phase i of the turnaround commenced during the third quarter of fiscal and continued into fiscal our goal was to reclaim market share  generating above average same store sales and validating our positioning within the market place 
we reported consecutive months of double digit same store sales increases beginning in september and continuing through september as a result of the strength of these sales  we were able to leverage many of our fixed costs including our buying and occupancy costs  a key component to improving our overall operating margins 
phase ii can be characterized by the aggressive repositioning of our real estate portfolio 
during the s and s  our focus was on opening stores in a malls throughout north america 
as shopping habits have evolved  with alternative venues such as lifestyle centers and big box strip centers gaining popularity  we began to migrate our stores to off mall locations 
in addition to being more convenient for customers and suitable for the sale of large items  such locations typically have lower cost structures  both from a fixed rent perspective and for other common area expenses billed by landlords 
management believes that the movement to the off mall locations will ultimately result in lower fixed costs for bombay and will help improve profitability 
another key aspect of phase ii included aggressively investing in marketing to attract new customers to bombay and support the move from mall to off mall 
during the late s and early s  we had become increasingly reliant on periodic catalogs to drive customers into the store and did not have marketing vehicles with a broader reach 
in fiscal  the marketing expenditures reached their historical low of of revenues 
during fiscal and fiscal  we increased our marketing to and of revenues  respectively  with much of the incremental spending going to support a program for monthly inserts in sunday newspapers in our top markets 
in addition to investing in new stores  we began making some key investments in our infrastructure intended to serve as the foundation upon which we plan to grow with competitive operating margins 
during phase ii  we made investments in our supply chain  in our information technology  in our distribution network and in key leadership positions 
as we began fiscal  we were facing a number of challenges 
we had a lack of new product in our inventory with an assortment over weighted in basic and core merchandise 
we also were effecting a significant number of migrations of our core bombay stores from mall to off mall  and at the same time  taking our bombaykids stores to critical mass 
additionally  we were anniversarying a year during which we recorded a same store sales increase 
we underestimated the impact of these factors  as well as the softness of the environment that would develop in the third and fourth quarters  which led to an overall decline in revenue for the year and a decline in same store sales 
the lower revenue base made it difficult to leverage fixed costs throughout the organization and for the year  the company reported a net loss of million 
with respect to our inventory assortment  we made the conscious decision to exit fiscal with higher levels of core merchandise than ideal 
while the merchandise was salable  it prevented us from bringing in appropriate levels of new fresh product 
as a result  both sales and margin suffered 
product flow and newness was further impacted by interruptions in the supply chain caused by the imposition of antidumping duties on bedroom furniture beginning in june while we were aware of the impending action by the us department of commerce and had taken action to move much of our bedroom furniture production from china to vietnam and other source countries  inefficiencies associated with dealing with new vendors  limited production capacity in these factories as bombay and other home furnishings retailers sought alternatives to chinese sources  and the inability  in some cases  to locate factories outside of china that were capable of manufacturing product to bombay quality and safety specifications  resulted in disruptions in our supply chain and significant voids in the assortment  particularly during the second half of the year 
we believe that we have taken  and are continuing to take  positive actions to correct these situations going forward 
we ended the year with a much improved merchandise mix 
we have hired a general merchandise manager experienced in overseas sourcing and have modified our plans with respect to new product introductions  eliminating sku count in certain categories and introducing additional classifications such as home fragrance  designed to increase repeat purchases and boost the overall productivity of the store 
we plan to slow the rate of product introduction in key furniture categories  and have taken steps to mitigate risk as we transition from one product line into another 
we believe that these actions should help drive improved sales and margins 
we continued to invest in marketing during fiscal  spending of total revenue on advertising 
however  we began to see a decline in the effectiveness of the reach vehicles being used and some investments were unwarranted 
going forward  the company expects to continue to invest in marketing at the rate of of revenues on an annual basis but will reallocate funds to focus on driving existing customers in to make additional purchases through the use of more direct mail pieces 
we also expect to invest more heavily in new store grand opening support and will readdress certain locations that opened softer than expected during fiscal with additional marketing spend 
while fiscal was a disappointing year in the short term  there were longer term successes 
we have continued to migrate stores successfully from mall to off mall locations 
during fiscal  we closed stores  of which the majority were mall based 
a total of real estate projects  including new stores and relocations  were completed during the year resulting in opening new off mall locations 
the total number of stores grew to  a net increase of stores 
while assortment issues adversely impacted new stores as well as existing stores  the overall four wall profit for off mall stores opened a full year was approximately to basis points higher than those of mall based stores and the average sales per store was higher 
occupancy costs in the off mall locations are in line with expectations and represent on average a reduction in per store costs compared to the mall store in spite of the fact that the average off mall store size is larger than its mall based counterpart 
the following table reflects the real estate portfolio at each fiscal year end january  january  february  units of total units of total units of total mall off mall outlet 
total we will continue to invest in the migration of mall to off mall locations during fiscal as leases expire 
overall  we expect to open to stores and close stores during the year 
by the end of fiscal  we expect approximately of our stores to be in off mall locations 
during fiscal  we also opened a total of bombaykids stores  ending the year with stores 
this growth  along with planned openings in fiscal  has helped us reach critical mass which we expect to result in improved efficiency in the buying  distribution  marketing and field operations functions 
we continue to prefer to open bombaykids stores adjacent to bombay locations thus enabling us to leverage cost and introduce a new customer to the bombay brand 
we will continue to invest selectively in infrastructure and  in this area  we achieved some major goals during fiscal in august  we relocated to a new distribution center in the northeast 
the previous location was severely undersized and resulted in excessive use of off site storage 
we also identified and have initiated plans to move to a new distribution center in the metropolitan toronto area 
the new facility will replace our current undersized location and is expected to result in improved operational efficiencies when it opens during the second quarter of fiscal we completed the rollout of the new point of sale system and the broadband environment to our canadian stores 
we relaunched our internet site on a more stable  reliable platform 
the new site has improved functionality and we expect to make continued enhancements to it in the future 
we have made improvements in our planning and allocations systems and expect to continue to invest in this area in order to improve our ability to forecast and assort our stores 
while we believe that these investments are critical to our future success  we also need to ensure that our expenses are in line with our revenue base 
as a result  we have taken steps in other areas to right size the organization and continue to aggressively control expenses as we seek to restore profitability to the company 
the infrastructure that we develop and the investments that we make will be critical to the third phase of our turnaround strategy 
our plan is to organically develop other retail concepts and areas of operations that would leverage our core competencies and become new growth vehicles for bombay 
this longer term strategy is dependent on successfully accomplishing earlier phases  which will be the focus for fiscal and beyond 
other disclosures the largest percentage of our sales and operating income is realized in the fourth fiscal quarter  which includes december christmas season 
same store sales comparisons are calculated based upon revenue from stores opened for more than months 
stores converted from the regular format to the large format and stores relocated from mall to off mall locations are classified as new and are excluded from same store sales until they have been opened for months 
stores relocated within a mall and whose size is significantly changed are treated as new stores and are excluded from the same store sales calculation until opened for a full year 
remodeled stores remain in the computation of same store sales 
cost of sales includes all costs associated with the purchase of product including  but not limited to  vendor cost  inbound transportation costs  duties  commission  inspections  quality control  warehousing and outbound transportation costs 
buying costs include costs associated with our buying department  consisting primarily of salaries  travel  product development and product sample costs 
store occupancy costs include costs such as rent  real estate taxes  common area maintenance charges  utilities and depreciation and amortization of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets relating to our retail locations 
the impact of inflation on operating results is typically not significant because the majority of our products are proprietary 
we attempt to alleviate inflationary pressures by improving designs  finding alternative production sources in lower cost countries and increasing selling prices subject to competitive conditions 
an anti dumping petition against china furniture makers for allegedly dumping bedroom furniture was filed during this created some disruption in the industry and in our flow of product as we shifted orders to vendors with production capacity in other countries in preparation for the unfavorable duties 
the actual duties determined by the us department of commerce were announced late in and we do not expect the impact of these duties to have a material effect on operations going forward

same store sales declines of were partially offset by sales from new stores  which contributed approximately million in net sales 
during the year  we opened large format stores and bombaykids stores 
increases from new stores were partially offset by the closing of large format stores and four regular stores which  in aggregate  contributed approximately million to net sales in fiscal direct to customer revenues increased to million from million in the previous year  attributable to growth in internet sales  which more than offset the decline in mail order revenues 
wholesale revenues declined slightly to million from million in fiscal due primarily to a decline in the bailey street business

the remainder of the increase relates to growth in our wholesale operations  in particular  bailey street  where revenues increased  to million from million in fiscal all regions of the us and canada reported positive same store sales  with all but the midwest reporting double digit sales increases 
at the end of fiscal  we had large format stores  regular stores  outlets and bombaykids stores

additionally  distribution costs had a negative impact on margins as they were deleveraged on a lower sales volume 
buying and store occupancy costs increased basis points  reflecting the deleveraging impact of these relatively fixed costs compared to the lower sales volume 
buying and store occupancy costs included impairment charges totaling 
million to write down the fixed assets related to ten unprofitable stores 
fiscal cost of sales  including buying and store occupancy costs  for fiscal was million  or of revenues 
as a percentage of revenues  these costs improved from in fiscal product margins declined basis points as we focused on our value offerings at key price points designed to increase market share and drive sales volumes

selling  general and administrative expenses fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were million compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  expenses increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal at the store level  expenses increased million  or basis points 
the increase was driven primarily by a million increase in store payroll resulting from the higher store count over the course of the year 
on a per store basis  total costs were down as we tightly managed expenses in a soft sales environment 
the basis point increase as a percentage of revenue is the result of the same store sales declines and a general softness in sales for all stores making it difficult to leverage fixed costs  particularly early in the year when store payroll costs tend to be more fixed in nature 
marketing and visual merchandising costs increased approximately million or basis points to of total revenue 
the increase in this category resulted from our decision to continue to invest in marketing despite the soft sales trend in order to drive traffic and reach new customers 
corporate office selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or basis points over the prior year  due to higher medical and other insurance costs of million and higher severance expenses of 
million associated with right sizing the organization 
additionally  audit expenses increased approximately 
million as a result of the new requirements for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of internet and mail order selling  general and administrative expense increased by million due to higher internet sales and higher hosting and design costs as we launched our updated website on a new platform 
also  we had approximately 
million less foreign exchange gain resulting from changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate  in addition to other less significant changes 
current year depreciation was million lower than in fiscal as a result of the prior year charge of million associated with replacing the company s point of sales system 
additionally  corporate incentive based compensation expense was million lower in fiscal than in fiscal fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses  including marketing  were slightly lower at of revenues in fiscal compared to of revenues in fiscal in dollars  total selling  general and administrative expenses were million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million 
at the store level  costs increased million but declined slightly as a percentage of sales 
major factors contributing to the increased costs include factors associated with the increase in volume and number of stores such as higher store payroll and bonuses  which increased million  and higher costs associated with credit card processing and collections  which increased million 
store payroll declined basis points as a percentage of revenue due to leveraging against the higher sales base while store bonuses  which are based upon improvement in store level profitability from the comparative prior year period  increased basis points 
other store level initiatives that resulted in higher selling  general and administrative costs included the replacement of the point of sale dial up environment with a new broadband communication network which resulted in increased costs of approximately million  and store opening and closing expenses of million 
marketing costs  including visual merchandising costs  increased million  or basis points  as we increased our distribution of monthly sunday newspaper inserts from three markets in late fiscal to markets in fiscal  in order to attract new customers and drive traffic into the stores 
growth in internet marketing  support for new store openings and general increase attributable to the increased store count also contributed to the higher marketing dollars 
corporate office selling  general and administrative expenses increased million compared to the prior year but declined approximately basis points as a percentage of revenue as we leveraged insurance and payroll costs against the higher revenue base 
corporate payroll  including bonuses  increased million as we built infrastructure to support the current and future growth plans 
insurance costs declined slightly primarily due to favorable experience relating to workers compensation insurance 
costs associated with infrastructure investment in systems resulted in an increase in depreciation and amortization cost and related operating costs of approximately million 
internet selling and operating costs also contributed to the increase during the period 
these cost increases were partially offset by foreign exchange gains of million related to the strengthening of the canadian dollar  and costs incurred during fiscal of million related to the settlement of a california wage and hour lawsuit and million relating to the departure of the former chief executive officer 
interest fiscal during fiscal  we had interest income of  and interest expense of  compared to interest income of  and interest expense of  in fiscal interest income declined as we had lower levels of invested cash balances during the year resulting from the lack of profitability 
however  interest expense also declined as we managed inventory levels and maintained average borrowing levels lower than in fiscal fiscal during fiscal  we had interest income of  and interest expense of  compared to interest income of  and interest expense of  in fiscal decline in interest income and increase in expense are the result of lower invested cash balances and greater utilization of the credit facility in the current year 
funds were primarily used to finance our capital expansion plan  with the addition of locations  and higher inventory levels to support both the higher store count and the increase in same store sales 
income taxes we provided income tax benefit of million in fiscal and income tax expense of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the effective rates were  and in the respective periods 
fluctuations in the effective rate were primarily related to foreign taxes associated with our canadian subsidiary and the relative significance of the profit generated by the canadian subsidiary to the overall consolidated entity  as well as the impact of state tax expenses that have not changed proportionately to income loss before income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and a line of credit 
we have a secured  revolving credit agreement with a group of banks  with an aggregate commitment of up to million for working capital  inventory financing and letter of credit purposes 
the available commitment under the facility is limited to a borrowing base generally comprised of of eligible inventory and of receivables  as defined in the credit agreement and with seasonal and reserve adjustments 
the aggregate commitment under the facility can be increased to million prior to september   at the request of the company 
at january   the bank commitment was million  and million was available for borrowings or additional letters of credit 
the credit facility expires september  fiscal during fiscal  we ended the year with cash and long term investments of million  million lower than at the previous year end 
capital expenditures were the primary use of cash  at million  as we opened stores  including large format stores and bombaykids locations  and a distribution center during the year in addition to routine purchases of software and equipment 
although we recorded a net loss of million  cash provided by operations was million  due primarily to non cash depreciation and amortization of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
cash flows from operations also reflects million of landlord construction allowances from store and distribution center landlords that help reduce the net outlay of cash related to the new construction 
at january   inventory balances were million higher than at january   due primarily to higher level of merchandise in transit from the vendors as of the end of the year 
inventory at the store level and in the distribution centers was similar to last year s levels 
inventory was per square foot of retail space as of the end of fiscal compared to per square foot last year 
on a per store basis  inventories decreased to  per store compared to  per store last year 
we believe that the quality of merchandise is much improved compared to last year with a greater portion of the assortment consisting of new product to support fiscal sales 
from a liquidity and capital expenditures standpoint  our strategy is to utilize our credit facility to finance seasonal borrowings and working capital required by store growth while we utilize cash flow from operations and our balance sheet to finance our capital programs 
the operating loss for fiscal and the resulting decline in the cash balance has caused us to reassess our liquidity and capital program and investigate alternatives to fund the continued migration of stores from mall to off mall and the growth of the bombaykids stores 
management has developed a plan that calls for a reduction in store growth for fiscal compared to levels previously announced and the disposal of certain assets which are either non operating assets or are not an integral component of our core operations 
in november  we announced that we plan to divest the bailey street wholesale operations 
we are currently in the process of assessing sale and liquidation scenarios as well as a combination of both 
substantially all of the assets of bailey street are current assets inventory and accounts receivable 
we also plan to sell non operating assets  including a company owned building occupied by a third party and a parcel of land adjacent to our company headquarters  in order to supplement our available capital 
we expect that the proceeds from the sale and or liquidation of our bailey street operation  along with the sale of land and building  should be adequate  when added to expected cash flow from operations  to fund our capital expenditure program and result in a higher cash balance at the end of fiscal our capital requirements for fiscal are estimated to be to million and includes opening to new stores during the year while closing approximately stores  resulting in an ending store count of approximately to stores 
other capital expenditure plans include the opening of a new distribution center to replace an existing undersized facility in canada and continued investment in information systems 
in connection with continuing operations  we have various contractual obligations and commercial commitments requiring payment in future periods  summarized in the table below 
in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years contractual obligations real estate operating leases      unconditional purchase orders   equipment operating leases   employment contracts 
  other contractual obligations    total contractual cash obligations      commercial commitments import letters of credit   standby letters of credit   guarantees of travel cards total commercial commitments   fiscal during fiscal  we used million of cash  ending the year with million in cash and long term investments 
the decline in the level of cash from fiscal  for both year end comparisons and throughout the period  is due to our higher capital expenditures and corresponding inventory levels in fiscal to support the additional stores and growth in same store sales 
the primary sources of cash were net income  including non cash depreciation  amortization expense and deferred tax expense  as well as the exercise of stock options 
cash was primarily used for capital expansion  partially offset by construction allowances granted by landlords  and to purchase additional inventory to support the larger store base and increased same store sales 
other significant uses of cash included the payment of federal income taxes and a decrease in other current assets  primarily due to a decrease in prepaid rent resulting from the timing of the end of the fiscal period 
capital expenditures totaled million and included the costs of opening large format stores  kids stores  one outlet  a distribution center in plainfield  indiana  investments in new point of sale  planning and allocation and other systems and routine purchases of equipment 
these expenditures were partially offset by construction allowances of million granted by landlords 
at january   inventory levels were million or million higher than at february  this increase represents investments to support the additional number of stores and higher sales levels 
the year end level was above desired levels as a result of aggressively buying to christmas sales that did not materialize 
critical accounting policies in the course of preparing the financial statements  management makes certain judgments relative to accounting policies that are appropriate in the circumstances and the application of those policies 
the following policies are those deemed to be most critical 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined based upon the weighted average inventory method 
cost is calculated based upon the actual landed cost of an item at the time it is received in the warehouse based upon actual vendor invoices  or estimates of costs for which an invoice is not present  or for which an allocation of shared costs is required 
in addition  we include the cost of warehousing and transporting product to the stores in our costs 
we regularly evaluate our compliance with the lower of cost or market principle 
items are evaluated by sku and  to the extent that the cost of the item exceeds the current selling price  provision is made to reduce the carrying cost of the item 
additionally  we review the aging of our inventory by sku 
the carrying cost of the item is reduced based upon certain age criteria and product category 
since the determination of carrying value of inventory involves both estimation and judgment of cost and market value  differences in these estimates could result in valuations that vary from the recorded amount 
each month  we record an allowance for shrinkage to provide for the estimated cost of lost or stolen inventory 
the amount of the allowance is determined based upon the historical shrinkage results and is adjusted at least annually to reflect current circumstances 
inventory is physically counted at all locations at least once each year  at which time actual results are reflected in the financial statements 
physical counts were taken at substantially all stores and distribution centers during january impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets with definite lives at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
this review includes the evaluation of individual under performing retail stores and assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of the fixed assets related to the store 
future cash flows are projected for the remaining lease life using a probability weighted approach to estimate the fair value of the store assets 
these projections consider such factors as future sales levels  gross margins  changes in rent and other expenses as well as the overall operating environment specific to that store 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  we record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the assets fair value and carrying value 
since the projection of future cash flows involves judgment and estimates  differences in circumstances or estimates could produce different results 
income taxes in determining net loss for financial statement purposes  we make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax benefit and the resulting tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
in the ordinary course of business  there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is not certain 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
although we believe that the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the current and historical income tax provisions and accruals 
deferred tax assets are recognized for items that have a difference between the time they are deductible for financial statement purposes and for tax purposes as well as for net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards 
as of january   we have recorded million of net deferred tax assets  including net operating loss and credit carryforwards of million recorded during fiscal as a result of our net taxable loss exceeding amounts for which a carryback was available 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgment  and the fact that a benefit may be expected for a portion but not all of a deferred tax asset increases the judgmental complexity 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis  considering all available positive and negative evidence  including the reversal patterns of the assets  our past results  the existence of cumulative losses in recent years  our forecast of future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
a significant factor impacting our evaluation of the deferred tax assets recorded as of january   was the net loss recognized for fiscal we believe that the performance of fiscal will not be repeated and that we will return to profitability in fiscal and beyond for the following reasons we entered with an improved inventory mix having elected to clear much of the undesirable inventory in late fiscal whereas last year  we entered the year with an oversupply of core and basic merchandise  which restricted our ability to introduce new  fresh product into the assortment and resulted in higher inventory carrying costs 
we have taken measures to substantially improve our merchandise assortment and the process by which we introduce new product and exit old product under the leadership of our new general merchandise manager 
we do not expect the supply chain interruption and additional costs that we experienced as a result of the imposition of antidumping duties on bedroom furniture from china  which necessitated moving production from china to vietnam and other alternative source countries 
we have an increased number of stores in off mall locations where operating costs are lower and where we have experienced higher average sales volumes  thus helping to improve the overall profitability of our stores 
additionally  many of these stores were relatively new or were the result of migrating from mall to off mall locations 
as the stores become more mature  we expect overall sales volumes to strengthen 
we have fewer new store openings planned for fiscal  which will reduce store opening expenses and help to reduce the cannibalization of existing stores  thereby enhancing profitability 
we have taken steps to reduce general and administrative costs in order to right size the organization and improve profitability 
based upon our evaluation  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the benefit of the deferred tax assets will be realized and  thus  no valuation allowance has been established as of january  however  if our plans for the return to profitability in the future do not come to fruition  or if other conditions indicate that the benefit of the deferred tax assets is more likely than not to be realized  we will record a valuation allowance to reduce the assets to their realizable value 
such valuation allowance  if established  would serve to increase our tax expense and reduce net income in the period in which it is recorded 
insurance we are self insured with respect to medical and dental insurance coverage offered to our eligible employees  up to a maximum of  per claim 
above that amount  medical insurance coverage is in place 
in connection with the self insured portion  we maintain a liability for claims that are in the process of being paid and those that have been incurred but not yet reported to our insurance carrier 
we base the amount of the liability upon historical claims experience and actuarial estimates regarding the exposure for claims incurred but not yet reported 
at january   the balance of the medical and dental liability was  since fiscal  we have also maintained workers compensation insurance coverage with a deductible of up to  per claim 
at january   we had recorded a liability of million  representing the estimated amount that will have to be paid in future periods related to the settlement of claims under the insurance policies for fiscal through fiscal the amount of the liability reflects expected remaining workers compensation claims based upon actuarial estimates  utilizing historical claims experience and other relevant information and trends 
prior to fiscal  our workers compensation insurance was not subject to a deductible 
beginning in fiscal  our workers compensation insurance deductible will be  per claim 
if circumstances change or if information becomes available that would indicate that future payments with respect to insurance liabilities would be different than what was previously estimated  we will adjust such liabilities accordingly 
since the amounts recorded for insurance liabilities are based upon various estimates  actual future requirements could vary from the recorded liabilities 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin is intended to clarify the application of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
for those entities  a controlling financial interest cannot be identified based on an evaluation of voting interests and may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests 
the consolidation requirement of fin was effective immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities vies created or obtained after january  fin also sets forth certain disclosures regarding interests in vies that are deemed significant  even if consolidation is not required 
in december  the fasb issued fin revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  which delayed the effective date of the application of fin to us for non special purpose vies acquired or created before february   to our interim period ended on may   and provided additional technical clarifications to implementation issues 
during fiscal  we adopted the provisions of fin r 
since we do not have any vies  the adoption of fin r had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
sfas requires that fixed production costs be allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of production facilities and that unallocated overheads be recognized as an expense in the periods in which they are incurred 
in addition  other items such as abnormal freight  handling costs and amounts of excess spoilage require treatment as current period charges rather than as a portion of the inventory cost 
sfas is effective for fiscal  at which time we will adopt the provisions of the standard 
we do not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised r  share based payment 
sfas r establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
the primary focus of sfas r is on employee services obtained in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the financial statements based upon their fair values 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
the standard is effective for our financial statements beginning in fiscal  at which time we will adopt its provisions 
we are in the process of planning our implementation and evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based upon the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
we have exposure to interest rate risk  as borrowings under our credit facility are based upon libor  prime and other benchmark rates which may fluctuate with market conditions 
based upon our seasonal borrowing levels  management does not believe that a change in interest rates of basis points would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
international purchases of inventory are primarily denominated in united states dollars  which reduces our risk to foreign exchange rate fluctuation 
our greatest foreign exchange exposure is with respect to intercompany transactions with our canadian subsidiary and translation of their financial statements for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
as of january  we had no debt or other market risk sensitive instruments
