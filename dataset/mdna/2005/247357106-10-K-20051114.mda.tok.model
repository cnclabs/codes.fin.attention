item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview outlook we reported record revenues for the second year in a row for the year ended august  in addition  the operating results of our core business were the highest in the company s ninety year history 
our record results were due to higher sales in both our domestic and international segments during in our domestic segment  sales increased by over  despite a reduction in soybean seed sales 
domestic licensing fees from cottonseed sales increased over due to trait fee price increases enacted by monsanto and higher unit sales of stacked gene products 
since we recognize greater revenue and profitability from stacked gene products  our business has benefited greatly from farmers increased purchases of these products over cottonseed products containing either an insect resistant trait or a herbicide tolerant trait alone 
we also saw a substantial increase in sales of our higher value products  such as dp bg rr and dp bg rr 
for the second consecutive year  these products were the two most widely planted cottonseed varieties  making up almost one third of all cotton acres planted in the us according to the usda 
according to a september usda report  us cotton plantings increased to million acres in as compared to million acres in normally  such as increase in cotton acres would enhance our earnings and generate additional unit sales 
however  we believe farmers decreased the amount of seeds planted per acre this year and therefore our unit sales increased only slightly 
soybean seed sales and profitability for were lower than which diminished our domestic results 
soybean seed results were lower due to a shortage of inventories  primarily in our most popular group v varieties due to lack of seed production caused by inclement weather that occurred during the harvest 
international operating income increased almost and sales increased over in as compared to the prior year  primarily due to strong revenue growth due to price increases and higher unit sales in australia  brazil and turkey  and through increased export sales to greece  spain and mexico 
many of these markets increased their area planted to cotton in and new product offerings in some markets resulted in increased demand for our products 
in china  sales declined at both of our joint ventures due to a reduction in cotton acres as well as strong competition from local varieties 
strategic transactions and events in august   we announced the acquisition of global licenses to develop and commercialize innovative insect resistance technology in cotton from syngenta crop protection ag syngenta 
in addition  we obtained licenses to a wide range of other syngenta enabling technologies that may be used to develop new products in both cottonseed and soybean seed 
in return for these licenses  we will pay syngenta million in installments due primarily over the next three years 
a portion of this amount represents contingent payments 
once the licensed traits are commercialized  we will receive of the net licensing revenues generated from these products 
we have recently decided to focus our development efforts on a dual insect stack combination of these syngenta traits  which we expect to be a combination of vipa and cryab genes 
depending on the timing of regulatory approval  we plan to have a limited quantity of seed containing these traits available for sale as early as we expect to commercialize the dual insect traits with a glyphosate tolerance trait beginning in  subject to regulatory approval 
we expect to incur incremental expenses of approximately million related to development of vipcot products in see acquired in process research and development located in this item for further discussion 
in january  we announced a collaboration agreement with dow agrosciences llc das under which we will develop  test  and evaluate elite cotton varieties containing das insect resistant traits 
we are continuing to work with these traits 
in october  das announced it had received full epa registration for its widestrike insect protection technology 
das commercialized the first cottonseed products containing widestrike in we may commercialize varieties containing das insect resistance technology if we reach a commercialization agreement 
to date no such commercialization agreement has been reached 
in may  we established deltamax cotton llc deltamax  a limited liability company jointly owned with verdia  inc verdia  a subsidiary of maxygen  inc in july   verdia was acquired by dupont  which we believe brings potential for additional investment capital  strategic focus and critical mass to our collaboration  which is aimed at developing value added traits for cotton 
we are currently developing traits for insect resistance  glyphosate tolerance and nematode resistance for cotton 
we are currently transforming cotton plants for both the insect resistance and glyphosate tolerance traits 
we expect to invest up to million over the next five to eight years to fund our portion of deltamax 
other matters we are continuing to rapidly develop new product offerings containing monsanto s second generation traits  bollgard ii and roundup ready flex 
on march   monsanto announced it had obtained us regulatory clearance for roundup ready flex cotton 
we had substantial seed production this year of new varieties containing these traits and are planning to commercially launch these products in we anticipate commercializing up to ten new products containing both the bollgard ii and roundup ready flex genes or the roundup ready flex genes alone in we expect to have sufficient seed of these varieties available for sale to plant one to two million acres next season 
the actual seed quantities available of these new products will depend on a number of factors  including final raw material purchases and quality assurance data 
in addition  we are continuing to develop products containing syngenta s vipcot technology and expanded field testing of vipcot products in we are focusing our efforts on developing varieties containing dual insect genes from syngenta and plan a limited commercial launch of these varieties in  depending on when full regulatory approval is obtained 
in addition  our joint venture with verdia  inc a subsidiary of dupont  deltamax cotton llc  continues development of novel cotton traits in the areas of glyphosate tolerance and insect resistance 
we are continuing to take steps to enhance value by returning excess cash to our shareholders 
on may   we completed the purchase of  shares of our common stock pursuant to a modified dutch auction tender offer that was announced on april  the shares were purchased at per share for an aggregate purchase price of  during  we purchased an aggregate million shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of million 
this includes shares purchased in the open market as well as the shares repurchased through the dutch auction tender offer 
in addition  on june   our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program to buy up to an additional million of our common stock 
the timing and amount of these repurchases will depend on market conditions  legal restrictions and other factors 
on october   the board declared a first quarter  dividend of per share  payable on december  to shareholders of record on november  the board will continue to consider alternatives for uses of excess cash  including additional share repurchases and increased dividends as well as other options 
we continue to seek opportunities to expand our international business into new markets  including india and parts of africa 
our subsidiary  d pl india seed private ltd  has expanded research and testing of our hybrid products throughout india in in addition  we recently have started a new cotton research program in the punjab region of northern india 
results of our testing programs from and have shown many of our products are competitive in india in terms of both yield and fiber quality 
we continue to pursue our litigation against monsanto company and pharmacia 
on february   the mississippi supreme court granted our petitions seeking interlocutory appeals of two rulings issued by the circuit court for the first judicial district of bolivar county  mississippi circuit court 
the appeals were consolidated  and we expect that the mississippi supreme court will rule on these appeals during after their rulings are issued  we anticipate the circuit court will set a trial date 
the mississippi supreme court has stayed the proceedings in the circuit court pending resolution of the interlocutory appeals 
see part i  item for further discussion 
separately  we are in an arbitration with monsanto over a series of disputes relating to the parties bollgard and roundup ready licenses and related agreements 
the arbitration  which is being conducted according to the rules of the american arbitration association  is in the discovery phase 
the arbitration panel has set an august final hearing date 
see part i  item for more information 
outlook future growth in sales and earnings will be dependent on a cotton acreage in the us and around the world  b the successful development and launch of varieties containing second generation traits from monsanto  bollgard ii and roundup ready flex  c our ability to continue to develop and commercialize varieties that have increased yield potential and enhanced fiber qualities  d our ability to continue to profitably expand our international operations  e the successful development and launch of the syngenta insect resistance technology  and f our ability to successfully develop and launch technologies that we will own or have more control over such as those being developed by deltamax cotton  llc 
due to our market position in the us  us cotton acreage has a significant effect on our sales and earnings 
as we have previously announced  we expect to provide earnings guidance later this year 
the commodity price of cotton has been lower in over price levels for most of we anticipate cotton yields to be near record levels again despite difficult weather conditions during the growing season hot  dry weather and at harvest three hurricanes in much of the us market 
we believe it is too early to estimate cotton plantings at this time 
we expect to have adequate supplies of seed of most of our popular cotton varieties for plantings  despite the impact of inclement weather conditions during harvest this year 
due to inclement weather during soybean harvesting in our mid south and illinois soybean seed production areas  supplies of some popular soybean varieties may be limited 
however  final cottonseed and soybean seed supply amounts are not yet available as processing and quality assurance testing have not yet occurred for most of the product offerings 
internationally  we continue to expand our global reach and we seek to improve the operating results of our existing ex us operations 
in  operating income improved significantly due to increased sales in most of our international locations 
due to the strong brazilian real and weaker cotton prices in  we expect acreage in in several of our international locations to be reduced as compared to planting levels 
in particular  we are already seeing a reduction in cotton plantings in brazil due to the strong brazilian real and because farmers experienced lower overall cotton yields in due to poor weather conditions during the growing season 
despite early indications of lower sales in brazil for  we believe this market holds great potential for strong earnings in the future because of the recent approval of bollgard 
although the bollgard gene was approved for planting  we only recently received approval to commercialize one bollgard cotton variety  dp b  as the brazilian regulations require each variety to be approved prior to commercial sale 
we have imported a small amount of dp b into brazil  which we intend to have planted to produce commercial seed quantities for sales in and beyond 
in addition  we continue to test additional bollgard varieties in order to obtain government approval to sell 
we also anticipate the brazilian government will approve monsanto s roundup ready gene in cotton 
once the roundup ready gene is approved  we will seek approval of roundup ready varieties for sale in brazil 
we are currently working with monsanto to develop strategies for commercialization of the bollgard and roundup ready traits in brazil in order to minimize farmer saved seed 
in australia  we believe increased competition from local products will result in lower demand for our products in and thus lower sales and profitability 
cottonseed sales and farmer plantings have only just begun in our southern hemisphere markets and will not occur until the spring and summer of in countries in the northern hemisphere 
thus  it is too early to accurately forecast international results for we will continue to develop new businesses in markets such as india  pakistan and portions of africa 
we continue to develop and test varieties containing new technologies from multiple sources 
we are developing products with monsanto s second generation traits  bollgard ii and roundup ready flex 
in addition  we continue to work with syngenta s vipcot traits so that these products may be commercialized as quickly as regulatory approval is received 
both monsanto and syngenta traits are being introgressed into our most elite cotton germplasm 
we believe we are uniquely positioned to rapidly introduce new technologies to both us and ex us cotton farmers due to the strength and breadth of our breeding programs and germplasm base  our technical services capabilities  know how  brand recognition and market position 
share repurchase program dividend policy in february  the board of directors authorized a program for the repurchase of up to million of d pl s common stock 
the shares repurchased under this program were used to provide for option exercises  the potential conversion of d pl s series m convertible non voting preferred shares and for other general corporate purposes 
at august   d pl had repurchased  shares at an aggregate purchase price of approximately  under this program 
in  d pl purchased  shares at an aggregate purchase price of  under this plan 
this repurchase plan has been terminated and replaced by the june plan discussed below 
on may   d pl completed the purchase of  shares of its common stock pursuant to a modified dutch auction tender offer that was announced on april   under a new plan separately approved by the board of directors 
the shares were purchased for per share for an aggregate purchase price of  the company also incurred associated expenses of approximately  in connection with the acquisition of these shares primarily related to legal and advisory services that have been recorded as a component of treasury stock 
on june   d pl s board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program to buy up to an additional million of the company s common stock 
we expect to repurchase shares under this plan over time and through a variety of methods  which generally will include open market purchases 
the timing and amount of repurchases under the program will depend on market conditions  legal restrictions and other factors 
the adoption of the june repurchase program replaced the february plan 
at august   d pl had repurchased  shares at an aggregate purchase price of approximately  under this plan 
currently  the quarterly dividend is per share 
the board of directors reviews the dividend policy quarterly 
assuming the dividend rate is maintained through  the aggregate payments will be million to the holders of the million common shares outstanding and million to the holder of the million preferred shares outstanding 
in addition  the board of directors continues to review uses of the company s cash position and alternatives for maximizing its value to shareholders 
see risks and uncertainties located in this item results of operations net sales and licensing fees in  our consolidated net sales and licensing fees increased to million from sales of million 
this increase was primarily driven by the following a an increase in the licensing fees charged per bag  an increase in sales of stacked gene picker products and lower payments on crop loss and replant programs  b an increase in cottonseed prices and higher sales of our higher priced  elite varieties  c a slight increase in cottonseed units sold  and d an increase in international revenues  primarily from in country sales in australia and brazil and from export sales to mexico  greece and spain 
sales in australia increased due to the introduction of additional bollgard ii varieties and an increase in the area planted to cotton

off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently utilize off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations amounts in thousands we have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts 
current estimates of our future payments under these obligations are shown in the following table 
payments due in fiscal years ending august  total and beyond long term obligations     operating lease obligations  purchase obligations   total     long term obligations are comprised of payments related to the syngenta transaction see acquired in process research and development located in this item for information concerning non contingent payments related to the syngenta transaction and payments required under research and license contracts with other third parties 
the amount reported as purchase obligations for relates to payments to be made to cotton growers and producers for a portion of seed that we will purchase in the first and second quarters of at august   we had open purchase contracts with many cotton and soybean growers  producers and conditioners that may require us to purchase minimum amounts of cotton and soybean seed if that seed meets our quality assurance standards 
the amount that we will pay for the seed that we accept is based on market prices that fluctuate 
the amount of seed that we will accept and the unit prices that we will pay cannot be known until that seed is delivered to us which should occur in the first and second quarters of and is tested for quality 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates overview management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in item of this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended august  the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we have identified below the accounting policies that involve those estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the related disclosures below 
since application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition revenues from domestic seed sales are recognized when the seed is shipped 
revenues from bollgard  bollgard ii and roundup ready licensing fees are recognized when the seed is shipped 
domestically  the licensing fees charged to farmers for bollgard  bollgard ii and roundup ready cottonseed are based on pre established planting rates for each of nine geographic regions and  for years prior to  considered the estimated number of seed contained in each bag which varied by variety  location grown  and other factors 
beginning in  picker and stripper cottonseed products were sold in bags containing approximately  seed or bulk boxes containing approximately  seed 
acala and pima cottonseed products continue to be sold in pound bags 
international export revenues are recognized upon the later of when the seed is shipped or the date letters of credit or instruments with similar security provisions are confirmed 
international export sales are not subject to return except in limited cases in mexico and colombia 
all other international revenues from the sale of planting seed  less estimated reserves for returns  are recognized when the seed is shipped  except in australia where certain immaterial revenues are recognized when collected 
all of our domestic seed products including those containing bollgard  bollgard ii and roundup ready technologies are subject to return and credit risk  the effects of which vary from year to year 
the annual level of returns and  ultimately  net sales are influenced by various factors  principally commodity prices and weather conditions occurring in the spring planting season during our third and fourth quarters 
we provide for estimated returns as sales occur 
to the extent actual returns differ from estimates  adjustments to our operating results are recorded when such differences become known  typically in our fourth quarter 
all significant returns occur or are accounted for by fiscal year end 
therefore  the application of this estimate could affect our quarterly information 
domestically  we promote our cotton and soybean seed directly to farmers and sell our seed through distributors and dealers 
we also offer various sales incentive programs for seed and participate in such programs related to the bollgard  bollgard ii and roundup ready technology fees offered by monsanto 
under these programs  if a farmer plants his seed and the crop is lost usually due to inclement weather by a certain date  a portion of the price of the seed and technology fees are forgiven or rebated to the farmer if certain conditions are met 
the amount of the refund and the impact to d pl depends on a number of factors including whether the farmer can replant the crop that was destroyed 
we record monthly estimates to account for these programs 
the majority of program rebates occur during the second  third  and fourth quarters 
essentially all material claims under these programs have occurred or are accounted for by fiscal year end 
provision for damaged  obsolete and excess inventory each year  we record a provision to adjust our reserves related to inventory based on our estimate of seed that will not pass our quality assurance qa standards at year end  or is deemed excess based on our desired seed stock level for a particular variety dump seed 
seed can fail qa standards based on physical defects ie  cut seed  moisture content  discoloration  etc  germination rates  or transgenic purities 
the amount recorded as inventory provision in a given year is calculated based on the total quantity of inventory that has not passed qa standards at any fiscal year end  any seed that is expected to deteriorate before it can be sold and seed deemed to be excess 
in establishing the provision  we consider the scrap value of the seed to be disposed 
an initial estimate of the needed provision is made at the beginning of each year and recorded over the course of the year 
adjustments for changes in our estimates are made monthly  if necessary 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item for further details about inventory reserves 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are estimated based upon temporary differences between the income and loss that we report in our financial statements and our taxable income and loss as determined under applicable tax laws 
we estimate the value of deferred income taxes based on existing tax rates and laws  and our expectations of future earnings 
for deferred income taxes  we applied a composite statutory income tax rate of approximately 
we are required to evaluate the likelihood of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income that will enable us to realize the value of our deferred tax assets 
if  in our judgment  we determine that we will not realize deferred tax assets  then valuation allowances are recorded 
as of august   we had recorded net deferred tax assets of approximately million primarily related to capitalizing the licenses acquired from syngenta in for income tax reporting purposes 
we estimate that our deferred tax assets will be realized  therefore  we have not recorded any valuation allowances as of august we use management judgment and estimates when estimating deferred taxes 
if our judgments and estimates prove to be inadequate  or if certain tax rates and laws should change  our financial results could be materially adversely impacted in future periods 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item for further details about income taxes 
contingent liabilities a liability is contingent if the amount is not presently known  but may become known in the future as a result of the occurrence of some uncertain future event 
d pl estimates its contingent liabilities based on management s estimates about the probability of outcomes and its ability to estimate the range of exposure 
accounting standards require that a liability be recorded if management determines that it is probable that a loss has occurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  it must be probable that the loss will be confirmed by some future event 
as part of the estimation process  management is required to make assumptions about matters that are by their nature highly uncertain 
the assessment of contingent liabilities  including legal contingencies and income tax liabilities  involves the use of critical estimates  assumptions and judgments 
management s estimates are based on their belief that future events will validate the current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome of these exposures 
however  there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions or irs positions  will not differ from management s assessments 
whenever practicable  management consults with third party experts attorneys  accountants  claims administrators  etc 
to assist with the gathering and evaluation of information related to contingent liabilities 
acquired in process research development in august  we entered into an agreement with syngenta to purchase global licenses to develop and commercialize syngenta s insect resistance genes known as vipa and cryab in cottonseed 
in addition  we purchased licenses to other syngenta enabling technologies that may be useful in developing valuable new products for use in cottonseed and soybean seed 
in return for the licenses  d pl is to pay syngenta million 
the purchase price will be paid in installments over seven years 
fixed payments of million will be made in installments through the first quarter of in  d pl will make certain decisions which will determine whether the additional million in contingent payments will be made 
for the year ended august   we recorded a charge of approximately  related to the write off of the acquired in process research and development ipr d and related transaction costs 
approximately  of the purchase price represents the fair value of the non contingent payments related to the acquired ipr d projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was immediately expensed in the consolidated statement of income on the acquisition date 
the remaining  of the charge incurred represents the related transaction costs  primarily professional fees 
the assigned value of each of the technologies acquired was as follows vipa  cryab  other  the vipa and cryab projects vipcot represent new technologies that are expected to compete with insect resistance technologies currently on the market  including technologies that are currently contained in varieties sold by us 
the vipa and cryab genes produce proteins that are toxic to certain lepidopteran larvae  the principal cotton pests in many cotton growing areas 
the acquired vipa gene provides for a novel mode of action for attacking larvae that consume the protein 
vipcot will require further development by us  including the introgression into our elite germplasm 
we estimate that we will incur the following costs to complete the projects     these projects will also require regulatory approval from the food and drug administration fda  the us department of agriculture usda  and the us environmental protection agency epa before commercialization can begin 
syngenta is responsible for us regulatory approval 
syngenta has advised us that they expect us regulatory approval to be obtained for the selected vipa cryab combination of events in  prior to the planting season 
if the regulatory approval process proceeds as expected  we may begin limited introduction of the vipa cryab combination of events in once commercialization begins  we will owe syngenta a royalty equal to of the net license fees received  after deduction of certain expenses  from these technologies 
we will retain the remaining of the net license fees 
there is no assurance that these technologies will result in commercially viable products or that such technologies are developed in the time frame or for the amounts estimated to complete 
also  there is no assurance that regulatory approval will be obtained for the products 
liquidity and capital resources in the united states  we purchase seed from contract growers in our first and second fiscal quarters 
seed conditioning  treating and packaging commence late in the first fiscal quarter and continue through the third fiscal quarter 
seasonal cash needs normally begin to increase in the first fiscal quarter and cash needs peak in the third fiscal quarter 
cash is generated and loan repayments  if applicable  normally begin in the middle of the third fiscal quarter and are typically completed by the first fiscal quarter of the following year 
in some cases  we offer customers financial incentives to make early payments 
to the extent we attract early payments from customers  bank borrowings  if any  are reduced 
in the us  we record revenue and accounts receivable for technology licensing fees on transgenic seed sales upon shipment  usually in our second and third fiscal quarters 
receivables from seed sales generally become due in may and june 
the licensing fees are due in september  at which time we receive payment 
we then pay monsanto its royalty for the bollgard  bollgard ii and roundup ready licensing fees  which is recorded as a component of cost of sales 
as a result of the timing of these events  licensing fees receivable and royalties payable peak at our fiscal year end  august the seasonal nature of our business significantly impacts cash flow and working capital requirements 
historically  we have maintained credit facilities  and used early payments by customers and cash from operations to fund working capital needs 
in the past  we have borrowed on a short term basis to meet seasonal working capital needs 
however  since  we have used cash generated from operations and other available cash to meet working capital needs 
we continue to evaluate potential uses of our cash for purposes other than for working capital needs 
on may   we completed the purchase of  shares of our common stock pursuant to a modified dutch auction tender offer that was announced on april  the shares were purchased for per share for an aggregate purchase price of  other potential uses of our cash in the future may be the acquisition of  or funding of  alternative technologies such as  or in addition to  deltamax and syngenta that could be used to enhance our product portfolio and ultimately our long term earnings potential and or an investment in new markets outside the us such as india 
another potential use would be the repurchase of our shares pursuant to our recently announced million share repurchase program 
we are currently considering other potential uses of our cash  including increasing the dividend rate or repurchasing additional shares depending on market considerations and other factors 
as a part of this analysis  we continue to evaluate the company s liquidity needs and its capital structure 
on april   we entered into an unsecured million credit agreement the credit agreement with bank of america  na the bank 
the credit agreement provides for unsecured revolving loans up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of million  plus letters of credit which were outstanding prior to the execution of the credit agreement in the amount of approximately million 
of the total commitment  million represents a seasonal commitment available from october to july of each year 
the credit agreement expires on july   at which time all outstanding amounts under the credit agreement would be due and payable  subject to the company s right to request a one year extension and the bank s acceptance of that request 
on october   the company requested an extension of the credit agreement and negotiations regarding this extension are underway 
in general  borrowings under the credit agreement will bear interest at a rate calculated according to a eurodollar rate  plus 
the eurodollar rate is generally the day  day or day libor rate 
we will also be required to pay unused fees of annually calculated on the daily unused portion of the credit agreement 
the primary financial covenant requires the company s funded indebtedness under the credit agreement to not exceed of certain current and long term assets  defined in the credit agreement and determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 
as of august   there were no loans outstanding under the credit agreement  other than the existing letters of credit as discussed above 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in the years ended august   and  respectively 
we anticipate that capital expenditures will approximate to million in annual dividends of  and per share were paid in  and  respectively 
aggregate dividends paid on common and preferred shares in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
on november   we announced that our board of directors had declared a per share dividend for the first quarter of the first quarter dividend will be paid on december  to shareholders of record on november  the board anticipates that quarterly dividends of per share will continue to be paid in the future  however  the board of directors reviews this policy quarterly 
based on a quarterly dividend of per share in  aggregate preferred and common stock dividends should approximate million in the company purchases its common stock in the open market from time to time depending on market conditions and other factors 
the shares repurchased may be used to provide for option exercises  conversion of our series m convertible non voting preferred shares and for other general corporate purposes 
from september  to august   the company purchased approximately million shares of its common stock at an aggregate purchase price of million

forward looking statements include statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance including when earnings estimates are discussed  existing products  technical developments  new products  new technologies  research and development activities  and similar matters 
these forward looking statements are based largely on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements as a result of  among others  changes in the competitive marketplace  including the introduction of new products or pricing changes by our competitors  changes in the economy and other similar events 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot assure you that the forward looking information contained herein will in fact transpire 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of our business include those noted elsewhere herein and the following demand for our seed will be affected by government programs and policies and by weather in all countries where we sell products and operate 
demand for seed is also influenced by commodity prices  the cost of other crop inputs  and the demand for a crop s end uses such as textiles  animal feed  cottonseed oil  food and raw materials for industrial use 
weather impacts crop yields  commodity prices and the planting decisions that farmers make regarding both original planting commitments and  when necessary  replanting levels 
these factors all also influence the cost and availability of seed for subsequent seasons 
the planting seed market is highly competitive  and our products face competition from a number of seed companies  diversified crop protection product companies  agricultural biotechnology companies  governmental agencies and academic and scientific institutions 
in addition  several of our distributors customers have also entered the cotton planting seed business 
a number of crop protection product and biotechnology companies have seed production and or distribution capabilities to ensure market access for new seed products and new technologies that may compete with the bollgard  bollgard ii and roundup ready gene technologies of monsanto  our principal licensor of such technology 
our seed products and technologies contained therein may encounter substantial competition from technological advances by others or products from new market entrants 
many of our competitors are  or are affiliated with  large diversified companies that have substantially greater resources than we have 
we currently are engaged in a dispute resolution and arbitration process with monsanto  the principal licensor of our cotton technology and competitor of ours in the cotton planting seed business 
in the arbitration  monsanto is seeking a determination by the arbitrators of its right to terminate certain agreements between our companies  including the bollgard and roundup ready licenses 
in addition  we are currently engaged in litigation with monsanto the january suit concerning the failed merger of the companies 
the result of this litigation and the process of litigating may materially affect the results of our business 
see part i  item there is no assurance that new technologies such as the deltamax and the syngenta technologies will result in commercially viable products or that such technologies will be developed in the time frame or for the amounts estimated to complete development 
also  there is no assurance that regulatory approval will be obtained for the products 
the production  distribution or sale of crop seed in or to foreign markets may be subject to special risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency  exchange rate controls  expropriation  nationalization and other agricultural  economic  tax and regulatory policies of foreign governments and shipping disruptions 
particular policies which may affect our domestic and international operations include the use of and the acceptance of products that were produced from plants that have been genetically modified  the testing  quarantine and other restrictions relating to the import and export of plants and seed products and the availability or lack thereof of proprietary protection for plant products 
the absence or lack of enforcement of intellectual property laws may lead to counterfeit and farmer saved seed which negatively impacts our sales 
in addition  united states government policies  particularly those affecting foreign trade and investment  may impact our international operations 
the publicity related to genetically modified organisms gmos or products made from plants that contain gmos may have an effect on our sales in the future 
in  approximately of our cottonseed that was sold in the united states contained either or both of monsanto s bollgard  bollgard ii and roundup ready gene technologies  and of our soybean seed sales contained the roundup ready gene technology 
although many farmers have rapidly adopted these technologies  the concern of some customers and governmental entities over finished products that contain gmos could impact demand for crops and ultimately seed raised from seed containing such traits 
in addition  regulatory approvals for monsanto s bollgard and bollgard ii technologies expire in monsanto is responsible for obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals and is planning to seek re registration of both bollgard and bollgard ii  but there is no assurance that their efforts will be successful 
due to the varying levels of agricultural and social development of the international markets in which we operate and because of factors within the particular international markets we target  international profitability and growth may be less stable and predictable than domestic profitability and growth 
furthermore  recent action taken by the us government  including that taken by the us military in the aftermath of the tragic events of september   the war in iraq  and conflicts between major cotton producing nations  may serve to further complicate our ability to execute our long range ex us business plans because those plans include future expansion into uzbekistan  pakistan and india 
world health concerns about infectious diseases also affect the conduct of our international business 
our customers in many markets  including the us  benefit from government subsidy programs 
the farm security and rural investment act of expires on january  although the bill includes the cotton planting season  and future us farm subsidy programs are uncertain 
various other countries  including brazil  have challenged  and may continue to challenge  the appropriateness of us farm subsidies through the world trade organization wto or other forums 
in particular  the wto has ruled in brazil s favor in its challenge that certain us subsidies violate the provisions of the wto 
it is not clear if  when  or to what extent  us subsidies will be modified as a result of this ruling 
however  in the event changes to subsidies are made  they may negatively impact us farmers 
us farm programs  government subsidies and wto rulings impacting such programs may materially affect the results of our business 
overall profitability will depend on the factors noted above  as well as worldwide commodity prices  our ability to successfully open new international markets  our ability to penetrate the texas high plains market  the technology partners ability to obtain timely government approval and maintain such approval for existing and for additional biotechnology products on which they and d pl are working  the terms of such government approvals  our technology partners ability to successfully defend challenges to proprietary technologies licensed to us and our ability to produce sufficient commercial quantities of high quality planting seed of these products 
any delay in or inability to successfully complete these projects may affect future profitability
