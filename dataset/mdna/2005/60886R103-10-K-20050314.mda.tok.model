item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview background we are a leading manufacturer of premium class a motor coaches  class c motor coaches and towable recreation vehicles 
our product line consists of models of motor coaches and models of towables fifth wheel trailers and travel trailers under the monaco  holiday rambler  royale coach  beaver  safari  and mckenzie brand names 
our products  which are typically priced at the high end of their respective product categories  range in suggested retail price from  to million for motor coaches and from  to  for towables 
based upon retail registrations in  we believe we had share of the market for diesel class a motor coaches  a share of the market for gas class a motor coaches  a share of the market for all class a motor coaches  a share of the market for fifth wheel towables and a share of the market for travel trailers 
we have conducted a series of acquisitions during our history  beginning in march when we commenced operations by acquiring substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a predecessor company that had been formed in in march  we acquired the holiday rambler division of harley davidson  inc  a manufacturer of a full line of class a motor coaches and towables 
in august  we acquired smc corporation  manufacturer of the beaver and safari brand class a motorhomes 
in november  we acquired from outdoor resorts of america ora three luxury motorcoach resort properties being developed by ora in las vegas  nevada  indio  california  and naples  florida 
in september  we sold the property in naples  florida 
each of these acquisitions was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  no goodwill amortization has been recorded for any of the company s acquisitions for the years of   or instead  sfas requires annual testing of goodwill for impairment 
we completed our annual testing of goodwill during the third quarter of as required by sfas and determined that there has been no impairment requiring a write down 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations for the fiscal years ended january   and january  all dollars represented are in thousands 
of sales of sales change change net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income performance in in  the industry  as well as our own business  experienced a rebound compared to the results of the first half of was very strong  and despite cooling off in the second half of the year  results for the year as a whole were markedly better 
during the cooling off of the market in the third and fourth quarters of  the company responded proactively in managing production run rates  and dealer incentive programs to ensure continued low levels of inventories 
this has helped position us positively as we move forward into during we continued to offer retail marketing promotions programs to our retail customers 
these programs have been successful in furthering our goal of assisting our dealer body in maintaining appropriate levels of inventories on their lots 
in particular  retail marketing promotions were important in the third and fourth quarter as the recreational vehicle market experienced a retraction compared to the first and second quarter of the recreational vehicle industry is extremely competitive 
retail customers have many choices available to them  and we have responded with innovations in our products to secure our position in the industry 
during we expanded our offerings to include more models that incorporate full body paint  hardwood cabinets  more powerful engines  raised ceilings  and aesthetic changes to the bodies of our motorhomes 
we believe that these changes have been well received by our customers  and we will continue to focus on producing high quality  innovative products based on feedback from both our dealer and retail customer bodies

increases in all lines of product reflect a stronger market compared to the company s overall average unit selling price decreased from  in  to  in this decrease in average selling price is related to strong growth in lower priced products in gas motorized coaches  and in towable products 
gross profit increased by million from million in to million in and gross margin increased from in to in the increase in gross margin in is illustrated below in the following table 
all numbers are expressed in thousands  percentages are expressed as percent of net sales of sales of sales change in of sales direct materials direct labor warranty other direct indirect total cost of sales the changes noted above  comparing to  are discussed below 
direct material increases  as a percent of sales  were due to both a shift in product mixes and to increases in commodity prices such as steel  aluminum  and petroleum based materials 
direct labor decreases  as a percent of sales  were predominantly due to improvements in automation of certain plant operations 
decreases in warranty expense  as a percent of sales  were due mostly to quality improvement projects  and improvements in recoveries from vendors for warranty claims 
decreases in combined other direct and indirect costs  as a percent of sales  were due mostly to efficiencies within the plants as a result of improved plant utilization 
selling  general  and administrative expenses s  g  a increased by million from million in to million in and decreased as a percentage of sales from in to in decreases in spending over the prior year  as a percentage of sales  are shown below in the following table 
all numbers are expressed in thousands  percentages are expressed as percent of net sales of sales of sales change in of sales wages and salaries selling expenses settlement expense advertising and print other total s  g a expenses the changes noted above  comparing to  are discussed below 
decreases in wages and salaries  as a percent of sales  were due primarily to increased sales volumes without additions to staff to support the increase in sales 
decreases in selling expenses  as a percent of sales  were due to stronger demand for product in the year versus the year 
decreases in settlement expense litigation settlement expense  as a percent of sales  were due to a slight decrease in the amount of new cases added  as well as favorable resolutions of cases during the year 
decreases in advertising and print  as a percent of sales  were a function of higher sales during the year for which the company did not increase total dollars spent 
increases in other expenses were a combination of increases in management bonus due to improved profits  increases in audit and related expenses for compliance with sarbanes oxley certification  as well as employee benefits such as health care costs 
operating income increased million from million in to million in the company s lower level of selling  general  and administrative expense as a percentage of sales combined with the increase in the company s gross margin  resulted in an increase in operating margin from in to in net interest expense decreased from million in to million in this decrease was related to lower debt levels during as the company continued to pay down long term debt 
capitalized interest was  in and zero in the company s interest expense included  in and  in related to the amortization of debt issuance costs recorded in conjunction with the company s credit facilities 
the company is expecting decreased interest expense for based on anticipated lower debt levels 
the company reported a provision for income taxes of million  or an effective tax rate of  for  compared to million  or an effective tax rate of for the effective rate remained consistent as the company has continued to receive the benefits associated with multi state tax filings  as well as favorable federal tax rates associated with foreign sales 
net income increased by million from million in to million in  due to the combination of increases in net sales  increases in gross margins  and increases in operating margins 
the company does not currently expense stock options granted  however  if option expensing were required  the impact on net income for for all previously granted options would have been a decrease of million 
see note of the company s consolidated financial statements for information regarding the calculation of the impact of expensing stock options

for  gross diesel motorized sales accounted for of sales  gas motorized sales accounted for of sales  and towables accounted for of sales 
for  gross diesel motorized sales accounted for of sales  gas motorized accounted for of sales  and towables accounted for of sales 
the increase in diesel motorized sales as a percentage of sales reflects the continued strong diesel market  while the decrease in towables as a percentage of sales was due primarily to a small decrease in market share from increased towable competition 
accordingly  as diesel motorized product grew as a percentage of sales  the company s overall average unit selling price increased from  in  to  in gross profit decreased by million from million in to million in and gross margin decreased from in to in the decrease in gross margin in is illustrated below in the following table 
all numbers are expressed in thousands  percentages are expressed as percent of net sales of sales of sales change in of sales direct materials direct labor warranty other direct indirect total cost of sales the changes noted above  as comparing the year versus the year  are highlighted below 
direct material decreases  as a percent of sales  were due to continued vertical integration of component manufacturing facilities 
direct labor remained consistent  as a percent of sales  for both and increases in warranty expense  as a percent of sales  were due mostly to challenges associated with model changes 
increases in combined other direct and indirect costs  as a percent of sales  were due mostly to inefficiencies within the plants due to lower production run rates  as well as increased costs associated with delivery of products to the company s dealers 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million from million in to million in and increased as a percentage of sales from in to in increases in spending over the prior year  as a percentage of sales  are shown below in the following table 
all numbers are expressed in thousands  percentages are expressed as percent of net sales of sales of sales change in of sales wages and salaries selling expenses settlement expense advertising and print other total s  g a expenses the changes noted above  as comparing the year versus the year  are highlighted below 
increases in wages and salaries  as a percent of sales  were due primarily to increased staffing to address administrative needs in the information systems area 
increases in selling expenses  as a percent of sales  were due to increased competition in the marketplace  and an aggressive program to maintain market share 
increases in settlement expense litigation settlement expense  as a percent of sales  were due to a slight increase in the amount of new cases added 
decreases in advertising and print  as a percent of sales  were a function of the company s plan of maintaining similar advertising spending patterns year to year 
decreases in other expenses were predominantly due to a decrease in management bonus which was a result of lower profits 
operating income decreased million from million in to million in the company s higher level of selling  general  and administrative expense as a percentage of sales combined with the decrease in the company s gross margin  resulted in a decrease in operating margin from in to in net interest expense increased from million in to million in this increase was related to increased debt levels during due to higher levels of inventory compared to the prior year  combined with increased capital requirements after the purchase of the outdoor resorts of america properties in november of capitalized interest was zero in and  in the company s interest expense included  in and  in related to the amortization of debt issuance costs recorded in conjunction with the company s credit facilities 
the company reported a provision for income taxes of million  or an effective tax rate of  for  compared to million  or an effective tax rate of for the change in effective tax rate was due mainly to benefits from sales to customers in foreign countries  and certain state tax benefits the company received 
net income decreased by million from million in to million in  due to the combination of a decrease in net sales and a decrease in operating margin 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash from operations and available borrowings under its credit facilities 
during  the company used cash of million from operating activities and had a net cash balance of zero at january  the company generated million from net income and non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization 
other sources of cash included a decrease in deferred income taxes of million  a decrease in resort lot inventory of million  an increase in accounts payables of million  an increase in product warranty reserves of million  and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million 
the uses of cash included an increase of million in trade receivables  an increase of million in inventories  an increase of million in prepaid expenses  and a decrease in income taxes payable of million 
changes in deferred income taxes are a result of changes in certain tax legislation that provided a favorable tax adjustment  decreases in resort lot inventories are a result of strong sales performance from the resort operations  increases in payables were a result of a buildup in raw materials related to shipments received near year end  increases in warranty reserves were due to higher sales volume  and increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities were due to combinations of increases in accruals for employee benefits  management bonus  and general insurance 
trade receivables increased due to the timing of shipment patterns at year end compared to inventories increased due to a buildup of raw material primarily related to purchased chassis which will be consumed in the first quarter of  an increase in work in process  and a more normalized level of finished goods inventory at the end of in  finished goods inventories were much lower than normal at year end 
prepaid expenses increased due to prepayments of certain information system requirements as well as prepayments for general insurance coverage 
income taxes payable decreased due to a lower accrual necessary at the end of which was a result of lower taxable income in the fourth quarter of versus the fourth quarter of on november  the company amended its credit facilities  increasing its revolving line of credit from million to million and extending the term of the facility for five years 
as part of the amendment process  the company moved amounts of million in term loans to its revolving line of credit 
at the end of the year  borrowings outstanding on the revolving line of credit the revolving loan were million 
at the election of the company  the revolving loan bears interest at varying rates that fluctuate based on the prime rate or libor  and are determined based on the company s leverage ratio 
the company also pays interest monthly on the unused available portion of the revolving loan at varying rates  determined by the company s leverage ratio 
the revolving loan is due and payable in full on november  and requires monthly interest payments 
the revolving loan is collateralized by all the assets of the company and includes various restrictions and financial covenants 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at january  the company utilizes zero balance bank disbursement accounts in which an advance on the line of credit is automatically made for checks clearing each day 
since the balance of the disbursement account at the bank returns to zero at the end of each day  the outstanding checks of the company are reflected as a liability 
the outstanding check liability is combined with the company s positive cash balance accounts to reflect a net book overdraft or a net cash balance for financial reporting 
the company s principal working capital requirements are for purchases of inventory and financing of trade receivables 
many of the company s dealers finance product purchases under wholesale floor plan arrangements with third parties as described below 
at january   the company had working capital of approximately million  an increase of million from working capital of million at january  the company has been using short term credit facilities and cash flow to finance its capital expenditures 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and funds available under its anticipated credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity requirements for the next months 
the company s capital expenditures were million in  which included costs related to additions of automated machinery in many of its production facilities  upgrades to its information systems infrastructure  and other various capitalized upgrades to existing facilities 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures for all of will be approximately to million  which includes expenditures to purchase additional machinery and equipment in both the company s coburg  oregon and wakarusa  indiana facilities  as well as upgrades to existing information systems infrastructures 
the company may require additional equity or debt financing to address working capital and facilities expansion needs  particularly if the company significantly increases the level of working capital assets such as inventory and accounts receivable 
the company may also from time to time seek to acquire businesses that would complement the company s current business  and any such acquisition could require additional financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available if required or on terms deemed favorable by the company 
as is typical in the recreational vehicle industry  many of the company s retail dealers utilize wholesale floor plan financing arrangements with third party lending institutions to finance their purchases of the company s products 
under the terms of these floor plan arrangements  institutional lenders customarily require the recreational vehicle manufacturer to agree to repurchase any unsold units if the dealer fails to meet its commitments to the lender  subject to certain conditions 
the company has agreements with several institutional lenders under which the company currently has repurchase obligations 
the company s contingent obligations under these repurchase agreements are reduced by the proceeds received upon the sale of any repurchased units 
the company s obligations under these repurchase agreements vary from period to period up to months 
at january   approximately million of products sold by the company to independent dealers were subject to potential repurchase under existing floor plan financing agreements with approximately concentrated with one dealer 
historically  the company has been successful in mitigating losses associated with repurchase obligations 
during  the losses associated with the exercise of repurchase agreements were approximately   and  in and respectively 
gross repurchase amounts for   and  were million  million  and million  respectively 
we have been successful at mitigating the losses associated with repurchase obligations 
dealers for the company undergo credit review prior to becoming a dealer and periodically thereafter 
financial institutions that provide floor plan financing also perform credit reviews and floor checks on an ongoing basis 
we closely monitor sales to dealers that are a higher credit risk 
the repurchase period is limited  usually to a maximum of months 
we believe these activities minimize the number of required repurchases 
additionally  the repurchase agreement specifies that the dealer is required to make principal payments during the repurchase period 
since the company repurchases the units based on the schedule of principal payments  the repurchase amount is typically less than the original invoice amount 
therefore  there is already some built in discount when we offer the inventory to another dealer at an amount lower than the original invoice as incentive for the dealer to take the repurchased inventory 
this helps minimize the losses we incur on repurchased inventory 
as part of the normal course of business  the company incurs certain contractual obligations and commitments which will require future cash payments 
the following tables summarize the significant obligations and commitments 
payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands year or less to years to years thereafter total operating leases total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration by period other commitments in thousands year or less to years to years thereafter total lines of credit guarantees repurchase obligations total commitments see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the amount listed represents available borrowings on the line of credit at january  reflects obligations under manufacturer repurchase commitments 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
inflation the company does not believe that general inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations for the periods presented 
however  increases in the price of some commodities such as steel  aluminum  and petroleum based materials did impact the company s material cost during see results of operations compared with critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to warranty costs  product liability  and impairment of goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
warranty costs estimated warranty costs are provided for at the time of sale of products with warranties covering the products for up to one year from the date of retail sale five years for the front and sidewall frame structure  and three years on the roadmaster chassis 
these estimates are based on historical average repair costs  as well as other reasonable assumptions as have been deemed appropriate by management 
product liability the company provides an estimate for accrued product liability based on current pending cases  as well as for those cases which are incurred but not reported 
this estimate is developed by legal counsel based on professional judgment  as well as historical experience 
impairment of goodwill the company assesses the potential impairment of goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
this initial test involves management comparing the market capitalization of the company  to the carrying amount  including goodwill  of the net book value of the company  to determine if goodwill has been impaired 
if the company determines that the market capitalization is not representative of the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  then the company will use an estimate of discounted future cash flows to determine fair value 
inventory allowance the company writes down its inventory for obsolescence  and the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value 
these write downs are based on assumptions about future sales demand and market conditions 
if actual sales demand or market conditions change from those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes in conjunction with preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company must estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
a discussion of the income tax provision and the components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities can be found in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
repurchase obligations upon request of a lending institution financing a dealer s purchases of the company s product  the company will execute a repurchase agreement 
the company has recorded a liability associated with the disposition of repurchased inventory 
to determine the appropriate liability  the company calculates a reserve  based on an estimate of potential net losses  along with qualitative and quantitative factors  including dealer inventory turn rates  and the financial strength of individual dealers 
factors that may affect future operating results we may experience unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results for a variety of reasons our net sales  gross margin  and operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to a number of factors  many of which are not readily predictable 
these factors include the following the margins associated with the mix of products we sell in any particular period 
we ship a large amount of products near quarter end 
our ability to utilize and expand our manufacturing resources efficiently 
shortages of materials used in our products 
a determination by us that goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired and have to be written down to their fair values  resulting in a charge to our results of operations 
our ability to introduce new models that achieve consumer acceptance 
the introduction  marketing and sale of competing products by others  including significant discounting offered by our competitors 
the addition or loss of our dealers 
the timing of trade shows and rallies  which we use to market and sell our products 
factors affecting the recreational vehicle industry as a whole  including economic and seasonal factors 
our overall gross margin may decline in future periods to the extent that we increase the percentage of sales of lower gross margin towable products or if the mix of motor coaches we sell shifts to lower gross margin units 
in addition  a relatively small variation in the number of recreational vehicles we sell in any quarter can have a significant impact on total sales and operating results for that quarter 
demand in the recreational vehicle industry generally declines during the winter months  while sales are generally higher during the spring and summer months 
with the broader range of products we now offer  seasonal factors could have a significant impact on our operating results in the future 
additionally  unusually severe weather conditions in certain markets could delay the timing of shipments from one quarter to another 
we attempt to forecast orders for our products accurately and commence purchasing and manufacturing prior to receipt of such orders 
however  it is highly unlikely that we will consistently accurately forecast the timing  rate  and mix of orders 
this aspect of our business makes our planning inexact and  in turn  affects our shipments  costs  inventories  operating results  and cash flow for any given quarter 
the recreational vehicle industry is cyclical and susceptible to slowdowns in the general economy the recreational vehicle industry has been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand  reflecting prevailing economic  demographic  and political conditions that affect disposable income for leisure time activities 
for example  unit sales of recreational vehicles excluding conversion vehicles peaked at approximately  units in and declined to approximately  units in the industry peaked again in at approximately  units and declined in to  units 
in  the industry climbed to approximately  units  but declined to  units during our business is subject to the cyclical nature of this industry 
some of the factors that contribute to this cyclicality include fuel availability and costs  interest rate levels  the level of discretionary spending  and availability of credit and overall consumer confidence 
the recent decline in consumer confidence and slowing of the overall economy has adversely affected the recreational vehicle market 
an extended continuation of these conditions would materially affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
we rely on a relatively small number of dealers for a significant percentage of our sales although our products were offered by dealerships located primarily in the united states and canada as of january   a significant percentage of our sales are concentrated among a relatively small number of independent dealers 
for the year ended january   sales to one dealer  lazy days rv center  accounted for of total sales compared to of sales in the same period ended last year 
for fiscal years and  sales to our largest dealers  including lazy days rv center  accounted for a total of and of total sales  respectively 
the loss of a significant dealer or a substantial decrease in sales by any of these dealers could have a material impact on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
we may have to repurchase a dealer s inventory of our products in the event that the dealer does not repay its lender as is common in the recreational vehicle industry  we enter into repurchase agreements with the financing institutions used by our dealers to finance their purchases of our products 
these agreements require us to repurchase the dealer s inventory in the event that the dealer does not repay its lender 
obligations under these agreements vary from period to period  but totaled approximately million as of january   with approximately concentrated with one dealer 
if we were obligated to repurchase a significant number of units under any repurchase agreement  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our accounts receivable balance is subject to risk we sell our product to dealers who are predominantly located in the united states and canada 
the terms and conditions of payment are a combination of open trade receivables  and commitments from dealer floor plan lending institutions 
for our rv dealers  terms are net days for units that are financed by a third party lender 
terms of open trade receivables are granted by us  on a very limited basis  to dealers who have been subjected to evaluative credit processes conducted by us 
for open receivables  terms vary from net days to net days  depending on the specific agreement 
agreements for payment terms beyond days generally require additional collateral  as well as security interest in the inventory sold 
as of january   total trade receivables were million  with approximately million  or of the outstanding accounts receivable balance concentrated among floor plan lenders 
the remaining million of trade receivables were concentrated substantially all with one dealer 
for resort lot customers  funds are required at the time of closing 
we may experience a decrease in sales of our products due to an increase in the price or a decrease in the supply of fuel an interruption in the supply  or a significant increase in the price or tax on the sale  of diesel fuel or gasoline on a regional or national basis could significantly affect our business 
diesel fuel and gasoline have  at various times in the past  been either expensive or difficult to obtain 
we depend on single or limited sources to provide us with certain important components that we use in the production of our products a number of important components for our products are purchased from a single or a limited number of sources 
these include turbo diesel engines cummins and caterpillar  substantially all of our transmissions allison  axles dana for all diesel motor coaches  and chassis workhorse and ford for gas motor coaches 
we have no long term supply contracts with these suppliers or their distributors  and we cannot be certain that these suppliers will be able to meet our future requirements 
consequently  the company has periodically been placed on allocation of these and other key components 
the last significant allocation occurred in from allison  and in from ford 
an extended delay or interruption in the supply of any components that we obtain from a single supplier or from a limited number of suppliers could adversely affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
our industry is very competitive 
we must continue to introduce new models and new features to remain competitive the market for our products is very competitive 
we currently compete with a number of manufacturers of motor coaches  fifth wheel trailers  and travel trailers 
some of these companies have greater financial resources than we have and extensive distribution networks 
these companies  or new competitors in the industry  may develop products that customers in the industry prefer over our products 
we believe that the introduction of new products and new features is critical to our success 
delays in the introduction of new models or product features  quality problems associated with these introductions  or a lack of market acceptance of new models or features could affect us adversely 
for example  unexpected costs associated with model changes have affected our gross margin in the past 
further  new product introductions can divert revenues from existing models and result in fewer sales of existing products 
our products could fail to perform according to specifications or prove to be unreliable  causing damage to our customer relationships and our reputation and resulting in loss of sales our customers require demanding specifications for product performance and reliability 
because our products are complex and often use advanced components  processes and techniques  undetected errors and design flaws may occur 
product defects result in higher product service  warranty and replacement costs and may cause serious damage to our customer relationships and industry reputation  all of which will negatively affect our sales and business 
our business is subject to various types of litigation  including product liability and warranty claims we are subject to litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business  typically for product liability and warranty claims that are common in the recreational vehicle industry 
while we do not believe that the outcome of any pending litigation  net of insurance coverage  will materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  or financial condition  we cannot provide assurances in this regard because litigation is an inherently uncertain process 
to date  we have been successful in obtaining product liability insurance on terms that we consider acceptable 
the terms of the policy contain a self insured retention amount of  per occurrence  with a maximum annual aggregate self insured retention of million 
overall product liability insurance  including umbrella coverage  is available to a maximum amount of million for each occurrence  as well as in the aggregate 
we cannot be certain we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future at acceptable levels or that the costs of such insurance will be reasonable 
further  successful assertion against us of one or a series of large uninsured claims  or of a series of claims exceeding our insurance coverage  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
we may be unable to attract and retain key employees  delaying product development and manufacturing our success depends in part upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals 
a number of our employees are highly skilled engineers and other technical professionals  and our failure to continue to attract and retain such individuals could adversely affect our ability to compete in the industry 
our recent growth has put pressure on the capabilities of our operating  financial  and management information systems in the past few years  we have significantly expanded the size and scope of our business  which has required us to hire additional employees 
some of these new employees include new management personnel 
in addition  our current management personnel have assumed additional responsibilities 
the increase in our size over a relatively short period of time has put pressure on our operating  financial  and management information systems 
if we continue to expand  such growth would put additional pressure on these systems and may cause such systems to malfunction or to experience significant delays 
we may experience unexpected problems and expenses associated with our manufacturing equipment automation plan as we continue to work towards involving automated machinery and equipment to improve efficiencies and quality  we will be subject to certain risks involving implementing new technologies into our facilities 
the expansion into new machinery and equipment technologies involves risks  including the following we must rely on timely performance by contractors  subcontractors  and government agencies  whose performance we may be unable to control 
the development of new processes involves costs associated with new machinery  training of employees  and compliance with environmental  health  and other government regulations 
the newly developed products may not be successful in the marketplace 
we may be unable to complete a planned machinery and equipment implementation in a timely manner  which could result in lower production levels and an inability to satisfy customer demand for our products 
we may experience unexpected problems and expenses associated with our enterprise resource planning system erp implementation we have recently begun to implement a new erp system and will be subject to certain risks including the following we must rely on timely performance by contractors whose performance we may be unable to control 
the implementation could result in significant and unexpected increases in our operating expenses and capital expenditures  particularly if the project takes longer than we expect 
the project could complicate and prolong our internal data gathering and analysis processes 
it could require us to restructure or develop our internal processes to adapt to the new system 
we could require extended work hours from our employees and use temporary outside resources  resulting in increased expenses  to resolve any software configuration issues or to process transactions manually until issues are resolved 
as management focuses attention to the implementation  they could be diverted from other issues 
the project could disrupt our operations if the transition to the erp system creates new or unexpected difficulties or if the system does not perform as expected 
new accounting pronouncements eitf in september of  the financial accounting standards board the board issued eitf  determining whether to aggregate operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds 
fasb statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  requires public companies to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments 
eitf addresses how to determine if operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds of fasb no 
are to be reported as separate segments 
the eitf task force has delayed the effective date of eitf to coincide with a related fasb staff position to be issued in we have not yet determined if the provisions of eitf will impact the disclosures to be included in future financial statements 
amendment to fas the board is amending fas  earnings per share  to make it consistent with international accounting standards  and make earnings per share calculations comparable on a global basis 
the amendment changes the computation to require the use of the year to date average stock price when computing the number of potential incremental common shares for diluted eps 
the old method was to calculate an average of potential incremental common shares computed for each quarter when computing year to date incremental shares 
the board has deferred the issuance of the final standard until we will implement the provisions of the proposed amendment  and will appropriately present them in our future financial statements 
fas in november  the board issued fas  inventory costs an amendment of arm no 
 chapter  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
the standard is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we have not yet determined if the provisions of the statement will impact the company s financial statements 
fas r in december  the board issued fas r  share based payment 
the statement replaces fas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the statement establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payments to employees except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans
