professional tax 
this segment includes our lacerte and proseries professional tax products and services 
other businesses 
this segment consists primarily of our quicken personal finance products and services and our businesses in canada and the united kingdom 

table of contents key accomplishments in fiscal in fiscal  we successfully executed growth strategies focused on our core markets of small business  consumer and professional tax  and accountants 
this enabled us to acquire more new customers in these markets and sell more products and services to our large base of customers over their lifetime 
we introduced several new products  including quickbooks simple start  which provides accounting functionality suitable for very small businesses  snaptax  designed for taxpayers with very simple personal income tax returns  proseries basic edition  designed for the needs of smaller and seasonal tax practices  proseries express edition  designed for tax practices that focus on helping taxpayers obtain their tax refunds quickly  quicken medical expense manager  and quicken rental property manager 
overview of financial results total net revenue for fiscal was billion  up compared with fiscal the fiscal revenue increase was primarily due to growth in our quickbooks related and consumer tax segments 
fiscal net income was million  up compared with fiscal net income increased in fiscal primarily due to revenue growth that was partially offset by higher spending for infrastructure  implementation of new information systems  new product development and promotion and sarbanes oxley compliance 
diluted net income per share was in fiscal  an increase of compared with fiscal diluted net income per share grew faster than net income in fiscal primarily due to the net reduction of average shares outstanding 
average shares outstanding declined as a result of repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs  partially offset by the issuance of shares under option and employee stock purchase plans 
in fiscal we generated million in cash from continuing operations  compared with million in fiscal the fiscal increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to higher net income from continuing operations 
we used million in cash for repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal seasonality our quickbooks  consumer tax and professional tax businesses are highly seasonal 
some of our other offerings are also seasonal  but to a lesser extent 
revenue from upgrades for many of our small business software products  including quickbooks  tends to be concentrated around calendar year end 
sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april 
these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january and third quarter ending april we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october and fourth quarter ending july  when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels 
strategy and trends strategy 
intuit s strategy is to apply our customer driven invention mindset and processes to solve complex customer problems 
the key to our success is our year history of staying focused on customer needs 
our in depth customer knowledge allows us to make more informed decisions that lead to better products and services for customers 
opportunities in our core markets 
while we have strong positions in our core markets for quickbooks and turbotax software  we believe that there are many more opportunities in the markets for small businesses and individual consumers 
many small businesses and individuals are using other methods  such as manual tools and processes or general purpose software 
in fiscal we began to explore ways to meet the needs of customers that we have never reached before 
for example  we introduced quickbooks simple start with accounting functionality for very small businesses and snaptax for taxpayers with very simple personal income tax returns 
we expect to continue this focus in fiscal and beyond 

table of contents importance of developing and introducing new products and services 
to remain competitive and grow in the future  we must continue to invest in initiatives aimed at uncovering and meeting new customer needs while enhancing our existing offerings to make them even better 
importance of technology infrastructure 
our internet based products and services include quickbooks online edition  quickbooks assisted payroll service  complete web based payroll  turbotax for the web and consumer and professional electronic tax filing services 
as our businesses continue to move toward delivering more web based products and services  our technology infrastructure will become even more critical in the future 
competition 
we have formidable competitors  and we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal and beyond 
for example  microsoft corporation currently offers a number of competitive small business offerings and has indicated that part of its growth strategy is to focus on the small business market 
microsoft has also announced its intention to target small business customers with accounting software and associated services 
in our consumer tax business  we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing or contracting to provide software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers 
critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  operating income or loss and net income or loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form k with the audit committee of our board of directors 
net revenue revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products  license fees  product support  professional services  outsourced payroll services  merchant services  transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items 
we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue 
for additional information  see net revenue in note to the financial statements 
we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver  to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
net revenue return and rebate reserves as part of our revenue recognition policy  we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates 
our return policy allows distributors and retailers  subject to contractual limitations  to return purchased products 
product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of obsolete products 
in determining our product returns reserves  we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel  historical return 
table of contents rates for prior releases of the product  trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products 
we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels 
our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end user rebates 
our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors and retailers actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs  which we typically establish annually 
our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program  actual sales during the promotion  the amount of redemptions received and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program 
in the past  actual returns and rebates have approximated and not generally exceeded the reserves that we have established 
however  actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain 
if we were to change our assumptions and estimates  our revenue reserves would change  which would impact the net revenue we report 
if actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established  the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue 
conversely  if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our future reported revenue 
for example  if we had increased our fiscal returns reserves by of non consignment sales to retailers for quickbooks  turbotax and quicken  our fiscal total net revenue would have been million lower 
if rebate redemptions for our quickbooks  turbotax and quicken products were to increase by  our annual total net revenue would decrease by approximately million 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
the accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses 
we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations  and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate 
if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established  that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income 
conversely  if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve  this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income 
goodwill  purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets impairment assessments we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to  consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business 
we evaluate cash flows at the lowest operating level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and integrated operations following acquisitions 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could 
table of contents materially impact our reported financial results 
more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges  which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
conversely  less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges  higher net income and higher asset values 
in fiscal we recorded an impairment charge of million on goodwill associated with our intuit public sector solutions business  which was subsequently sold 
at july  we had million in goodwill and million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet 
accounting for stock based incentive programs through the end of fiscal  we measured compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  we did not record compensation expense when stock options were granted to eligible participants as long as the exercise price was not less than the fair market value of the stock when the option was granted 
we also did not record compensation expense for shares purchased in connection with our employee stock purchase plan as long as the purchase price of the stock was not less than of the lower of the fair market value of the stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we disclosed our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs 
to determine the pro forma impact of applying sfas  we estimated the fair value of our options using the black scholes option valuation model 
this model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
this model also requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected volatility of our common stock price 
the assumptions we used for the valuation model are set forth in note to the financial statements 
the appropriate volatility factor for stock options and for our employee stock purchase plan is the estimated future volatility of our stock over the expected life of the options 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal we estimated the volatility factors for stock options and for our employee stock purchase plan using the historical volatility of our stock over the most recent five year period 
from the fourth quarter of fiscal through the third quarter of fiscal we estimated the volatility factors for stock options using the historical volatility of our stock over the most recent three year period  which was approximately equal to the average expected life of our options 
during that time we estimated the volatility factors for our employee stock purchase plan using the historical volatility of our stock over the most recent one year period  which was equal to the length of the offering periods under that plan 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal we estimated the volatility factors for stock options and for our employee stock purchase plan using the implied volatility of our stock 
we estimated the implied volatility of our stock using the prices of publicly traded options  which we believe provides a more accurate estimate of expected volatility factors over the life of the options 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates 
in the future  we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes valuation model or a different valuation model  which could result in a significantly different impact on our net income or loss 
on december  the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
this standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after june  we are required to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending july  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant 
table of contents adverse impact on our net income and net income per share 
see recent accounting pronouncements later in this item legal contingencies we are subject to certain legal proceedings  as well as demands  claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business 
we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
our accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
income taxes estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes and valuation allowance when we prepare our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we record an additional amount in our provision for income taxes in the period in which we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate tax assessment to be 
if in a later period we determine that payment of this additional amount is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in that later period 
as a result  our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax rate and materially affect our operating results 
this also requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period  we record a corresponding tax expense on our statement of operations 
our net deferred tax asset at july  was million  net of the valuation allowance of million 
we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets consisting primarily of certain state capital loss carryforwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable 
while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  we could be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize 
an increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact  which could be material  on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase 

table of contents results of operations financial overview fiscal fiscal fiscal change change dollars in millions  except per share amounts total net revenue operating income from continuing operations net income from continuing operations diluted net income per share from continuing operations net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations total net revenue increased in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to growth in quickbooks  quickbooks payroll and innovative merchant solutions merchant services revenue in our quickbooks related segment and to growth in turbotax for the web and electronic filing and refund transfer services in our consumer tax segment 
total net revenue increased in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to higher quickbooks payroll revenue in our quickbooks related segment and to growth in revenue from turbotax for the web and electronic filing services in our consumer tax segment 
operating income from continuing operations grew faster than total net revenue in fiscal because the increase in total net revenue was only partially offset by higher spending for infrastructure  implementation of our new information systems  new product development and promotion and sarbanes oxley compliance 
operating income from continuing operations grew faster than total net revenue in fiscal primarily due to an increase in revenue from higher margin products  such as industry specific versions of quickbooks and quickbooks payroll  and to the fact that we reduced costs while revenue grew in our quicken business 
net income from continuing operations grew more slowly than operating income from continuing operations in fiscal in fiscal we reversed million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved while in fiscal we reversed only million of such reserves 
net income from continuing operations grew at about the same rate as operating income from continuing operations in fiscal primarily because lower interest and other income and lower gains on marketable equity securities and other investments were offset by our reversal of million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved 
diluted net income per share from continuing operations grew faster than net income from continuing operations in fiscal and primarily due to the net reduction of average shares outstanding 
average shares outstanding declined as a result of repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs  partially offset by the issuance of shares under option and employee stock purchase plans 
at july  our cash  cash equivalents and investments totaled million  a decrease of million from july  in fiscal we generated cash primarily from continuing operations and by issuing common stock under employee stock plans 
we used cash in fiscal primarily for repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs and capital expenditures 
in fiscal we bought million shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs at an average price of for a total price of million 
we completed our fourth stock repurchase program in march in may our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock from time to time over a three year period under a fifth repurchase plan that expires on may  at july  authorized funds of million remained available under this fifth stock repurchase program 
we expect to continue to repurchase shares under this program during fiscal

quickbooks revenue grew on higher unit volume resulting 
table of contents primarily from an increase in new customers and on a favorable product mix 
the increase in merchant services revenue was primarily due to growth in the customer base  higher transaction volume per customer and our discontinuation of the outsourcing of certain merchant processing services beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal we completed the transition to recognizing the full revenue from processing merchant transactions that were formerly processed through two major banks rather than the smaller profit sharing fees we would have received under our prior arrangement with those banks 
quickbooks payroll revenue was higher in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily because of growth in the customer base  price increases and the successful launch of our higher priced enhanced payroll plus offering 
enhanced payroll plus provides quickbooks software upgrades in addition to federal and state tax forms and workers compensation tracking 
fiscal compared with fiscal quickbooks related total net revenue grew in fiscal compared with fiscal due to increased sales of higher priced industry specific versions of quickbooks and higher quickbooks payroll revenue driven by growth in the average customer base  an increase in quickbooks related services and the realization in fiscal of the full impact of a december price increase 
the october acquisition of our innovative merchant solutions merchant services business also contributed to the higher fiscal total net revenue in this segment 
intuit branded small business fiscal compared with fiscal intuit branded small business total net revenue increased in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to growth in our outsourced payroll and intuit real estate solutions ires businesses 
higher outsourced payroll revenue was driven by growth in the number of quickbooks assisted payroll service and complete payroll customers processing payrolls  price increases and higher interest income on funds held for payroll customers  partially offset by attrition in the premier payroll service customer base 
the increase in ires revenue was a result of growth in sales to larger customers 
fiscal compared with fiscal intuit branded small business total net revenue increased in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to new client acquisition in our wholesale durable goods and property management solutions businesses as well as higher average selling prices from increased customer use of support and other services in these businesses

fiscal compared with fiscal professional tax total net revenue grew slightly in fiscal compared with fiscal due to additional sales to existing customers  higher average selling prices related to product enhancements and increased sales of our unlimited electronic filing product as a result of new government rules requiring the electronic filing of certain professionally prepared income tax returns 
however  revenue growth in fiscal was negatively impacted by competition from lower priced professional tax preparation software products 

table of contents other businesses fiscal compared with fiscal other businesses total net revenue increased in fiscal compared with fiscal quicken service revenue was higher in fiscal primarily due to the growing base of financial institutions paying for quicken connectivity and growth in our bill payment customer base 
canadian revenue increased in fiscal primarily due to market share gains for quickbooks software and higher subscription revenue for payroll services that was driven by improvements in service levels 
fiscal compared with fiscal other businesses total net revenue grew slightly in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to higher quicken revenue 
in fiscal quicken direct unit sales increased in response to direct mail campaigns for upgrades due to the discontinuation of support for older versions of the product and for turbotax cross selling offers 
retail unit sales also increased 
aggregate average selling prices for quicken were higher in fiscal compared with fiscal due to a shift in demand to our higher priced quicken premier and quicken home and business products 
partially offsetting these increases  quicken other revenue declined in fiscal due to the expiration or termination of contracts with several significant online advertising customers 
we exited the online advertising business in the fourth quarter of fiscal canadian revenue in us dollars was slightly higher in fiscal compared with fiscal due to the favorable effect of the strengthening canadian dollar in fiscal total net revenue in canadian dollars decreased in fiscal compared with fiscal  primarily due to lower demand for quickbooks in canada 
quicktax revenue was also down in fiscal due to a decline in unit sales that was partially offset by higher average selling prices related to a shift in demand toward the higher priced specialty versions of that product

see note to the financial statements 
at july  we had net deferred tax assets of million  which included a valuation allowance of million for certain state capital loss carryforwards 
we decreased the valuation allowance by million in fiscal due to the realization of state capital loss carryforwards that were previously estimated to be unrealizable and adjustments made to foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
the allowance reflects management s assessment that we may not receive the benefit of certain loss carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions 
while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient  it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax assets 
we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis

recent accounting pronouncements sfas r  share based payment on december  the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment  sfas r which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supercedes apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure of fair value recognition will no longer be an alternative 
sfas r is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier adoption permitted 
we are required to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending july  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above but also permits restatement using amounts previously disclosed under the pro forma provisions of sfas either for a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we have not yet chosen a method of adoption for sfas r 
as permitted by sfas  through the end of fiscal we accounted for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method 
as a consequence  we generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

table of contents although the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have no adverse impact on our balance sheet or net cash flows  it will have a significant adverse impact on our net income and net income per share 
the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas to share based payments to employees in prior periods are disclosed in note under stock based incentive programs 
although the pro forma effects of applying sfas may be indicative of the effects of applying sfas r  the provisions of these two statements differ in some important respects 
the actual effects of adopting sfas r will depend on numerous factors including the valuation model we use to value future share based payments to employees  estimated forfeiture rates and the accounting policies we adopt concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period 
we currently estimate that the fiscal impact on intuit of adopting sfas r will be a decrease in net income of approximately million 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under current accounting rules 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
total cash flow will remain unchanged compared with cash flow as it would have been reported under prior accounting rules 
sfas  accounting changes and error corrections on june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces apb  accounting changes  and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
apb previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas carries forward many other provisions of apb without change  including the provisions related to the reporting of a change in accounting estimate  a change in the reporting entity and the correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect our adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents risks that could affect future results in evaluating intuit and our business  you should consider the following factors in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k 
forward looking statements in this report are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
any of the following risks could seriously harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we face intense competitive pressures in all of our businesses that may negatively impact our revenue  profitability and market position 
we have formidable competitors  and we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal and beyond 
the number  resources and sophistication of the companies with whom we compete has increased as we continue to expand our product and service offerings 
microsoft corporation  in particular  presents a significant threat to a number of our businesses due to its market position  strategic focus and superior financial resources 
our competitors may introduce new and improved products and services  bundle new offerings with market leading products  reduce prices  gain better access to distribution channels  advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services 
any of these competitive actions taken over any prolonged period could diminish our revenue and profitability and could affect our ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers 
some additional competitive factors that may impact our businesses are discussed below 
quickbooks related 
losing existing or potential quickbooks customers to competitors causes us to lose potential software revenue and limits our opportunities to sell related products and services such as our financial supplies  quickbooks payroll and merchant service offerings 
many competitors and potential competitors provide  or have expressed significant interest in providing  accounting and business management products and services to small businesses 
for example  microsoft currently offers a number of competitive small business offerings and has indicated part of its growth strategy is to focus on small business offerings 
in november microsoft announced the impending launch of a number of product and service offerings aimed at small businesses  including a product named microsoft office small business accounting  which is expected to be integrated with the microsoft office product suite and available in the fall of microsoft also announced partnerships with adp and other service providers to offer payroll related services that interact with its products 
in july microsoft announced that it will collaborate with leading merchant acquiring institutions  including chase merchant services llc  to offer credit card processing for microsoft office small business accounting 
accordingly  we expect that competition from microsoft in the small business area will intensify over time with the introduction of these and other offerings that directly compete with our quickbooks and other offerings 
although we have successfully competed with microsoft in the past  given its market position and resources  microsoft s small business product and service offerings may have a significant negative impact on our revenue and profitability 
consumer tax 
our consumer tax business faces significant competition from both the public and private sector 
in the public sector we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing or contracting to provide software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers 
federal government 
agencies of the us government have made several attempts during the two most recent presidential administrations to offer taxpayers a form of free tax preparation software and filing service 
however  in october the us internal revenue service agreed not to provide its own competing tax software product or service so long as participants in an association of private tax preparation software companies  including intuit  agreed to provide web based federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to qualified taxpayers for a period of three years  subject to recurring two year extensions 
the relationship  called the free file alliance  is principally designed to serve lower income  disadvantaged and underserved taxpayers with the objective of making free federal online tax preparation software and filing services available to at least of taxpayers 
the agreement is currently under negotiation by the federal government 
table of contents and the free file alliance for possible changes 
although  for the time being  the free file alliance has kept the federal government from being a direct competitor to our tax offerings  it has fostered additional web based competition and has the potential to cause us to lose revenue opportunities for a large percentage of the tax base 
over time  a growing number of competitors have used the free file alliance as a free marketing tool by giving away services at the federal level and attempting to make money by selling state filing and other services 
accordingly  for the tax season we modified our free file alliance offering to permit all taxpayers to prepare and file federal returns at no charge 
our free web based offering was fully functional but it did not allow the download of prior year information into the current year tax return 
although we were successful in the tax season in selling free file alliance users enhanced offerings and state tax preparation services  we may not be successful in this endeavor in the future 
in addition  persons who formerly have paid for our products may elect to use our unpaid federal offering instead 
any amendments to the current agreement could also have unexpected and negative effects on our business 
further  were the federal government to terminate the free file alliance and elect to provide its own software and electronic filing services available to taxpayers at no charge it would negatively impact our revenue and profits 
state governments 
state taxing authorities have also actively pursued strategies to provide free online tax return preparation and electronic filing services for state taxpayers 
for the tax season states  including california  directly offered their own online services to taxpayers 
in addition  for the tax season california tested its ready return concept by preparing about  state income tax returns from available electronic sources and presenting them at no additional cost to taxpayers for acceptance and filing 
it is possible that other governmental entities that currently do not offer such services will elect to pursue similar competitive offerings in the future 
these publicly sponsored programs have caused us to lose potential customers to free offerings and have enabled competitors to gain market share at our expense by using participation in the free alliances as an effective tool to attract customers to ancillary paid offerings 
given the efficiencies that electronic tax filing provides to taxing authorities  we anticipate that governmental competition will present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future 
private sector 
in the private sector we face intense competition primarily from h r block  the makers of taxcut software  and increasingly from web based competitive offerings where we are subject to significant and increasing price pressure 
we also compete for customers with low cost assisted tax preparation businesses  such as h r block 
other segments intuit branded small business  professional tax and other businesses 
our professional tax offerings face pricing pressure from competitors seeking to obtain our customers through deep product discounts and loss of customers to competitors offering no frills offerings at low prices  such as kleinrock publishing s atx product line 
this business also faces competition from competitively priced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with non tax functionality 
the substantial size of our principal competitors in the outsourced payroll services business benefit from greater economies of scale that may result in pricing pressure for our offerings 
in addition  in november microsoft announced that it had entered into partnership agreements with adp and other service providers to offer payroll related services that interact with its products 
the growth of electronic banking and other electronic payment systems is decreasing the demand for checks and consequently causing pricing pressure for our supplies products as competitors aggressively compete for share of this shrinking market 
our quicken products compete both with microsoft money  which is aggressively promoted and priced  and with web based electronic banking and personal finance tracking and management tools that are becoming increasingly available at no cost to consumers 
these competitive pressures may result in reduced revenue and lower profitability for our quicken product line and related bill payment service offering 
future revenue growth for our core products depends upon our introduction of new and enhanced products and services 
our customer driven invention and associated product development efforts are critical to our success 
the introduction of new offerings and product and service enhancements are necessary for us to differentiate 
table of contents our offerings from those of our competitors and to motivate our existing customers to purchase upgrades  or current year products in the case of our tax offerings 
a number of our businesses derive a significant amount of their revenue through one time upfront license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings that include upgrades to generate a significant portion of their revenues 
as our existing products mature  encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value 
if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of upgraded products to our customers  our upgrade and service revenues will be negatively impacted 
similarly  our business will be harmed if we are not successful in our efforts to develop and introduce new products and services to retain our existing customers  expand our customer base and increase revenues per customer 
our new product and service offerings may not achieve market success or may cannibalize sales of our existing products  causing our revenues and earnings to decrease 
our future success depends in large part upon our ability to identify emerging opportunities in our target markets and our capacity to quickly develop  and sell products and services that satisfy these demands in a cost effective manner 
successfully predicting demand trends is difficult  and we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on products or services that do not ultimately succeed in their markets 
we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past 
for example  in we discontinued our quickbooks premier healthcare offering due to lack of customer demand 
if we misjudge customer needs  our new products and services will not succeed and our revenues and earnings will be negatively impacted 
in addition  as we expand our offerings to new customer categories we run the risk of customers shifting from higher priced and higher margin products to newly introduced lower priced offerings 
for instance  our new quickbooks simple start offering  our new snap tax offering and our new proseries basic and proseries express offerings may attract users that would otherwise have purchased our higher priced  more full featured offerings 
the nature of our products necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant product quality problems or delays  it will harm our revenues  operating income and reputation 
all of our tax products and many of our non tax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays 
many of our products are highly complex and require interoperability with other software products and services 
our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by april th 
due to this complexity and the condensed development cycles under which we operate  our products sometimes contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software 
for example  our software may face interoperability difficulties with software operating systems or programs being used by our customers 
when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code  distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels 
if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date 
any major defects or launch delays could lead to the following loss of customers to competitors  which could also deprive us of future revenue attributable to repeat purchases  product upgrades and purchases of related services  negative publicity and damage to our brands  customer dissatisfaction  reduced retailer shelf space and product promotions  and increased operating expenses  such as inventory replacement costs and in our consumer tax business  expenses resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products 

table of contents the growth of our business depends on our ability to adapt to rapid technological change 
the software industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
our right for me marketing approach increases the importance for us of developing additional versions of our products to meet specific customer needs 
our ability to succeed in this rapidly changing environment requires that we continuously invest resources to enhance our software architecture and developer tools 
we must make this investment in order to continue to enhance our current products and develop new products to meet changing customer needs and to attract and retain talented software developers 
we are currently in the process of modernizing the software platforms for a number of our product lines  including our quickbooks  turbotax  quicken and idms products 
completing these upgrades and adapting to other technological developments may require considerable time and expense 
if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in upgrading our software architecture  our ability to develop new products and enhancements to our current products would suffer 
if we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our electronic tax offerings  or if the irs or other governmental agencies experience difficulties in receiving customer submissions  we could lose revenue and customers 
our web based tax preparation services  electronic filing services and pay as you go services are an important and growing part of our tax businesses and must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during the peak tax season from january to april 
we face significant risks and challenges in maintaining these services and maintaining adequate service levels  particularly during peak volume service times 
similarly  governmental entities receiving electronic tax filings must also handle large volumes of data and may experience difficulties with their systems preventing the receipt of electronic filings 
if customers are unable to file their returns electronically they may elect to make paper filings 
this would result in reduced electronic tax return preparation and filing revenues and profits and would negatively impact our reputation and ability to keep and attract customers who demand a reliable electronic filing experience 
we have experienced relatively brief unscheduled interruptions in our electronic filing and or tax preparation services during past tax years 
for example  on april  we experienced a relatively brief unscheduled interruption in our electronic filing service during which certain users of our professional tax products were unable to receive confirmation from us that their electronic filing had been accepted and on april  we reached maximum capacity for processing e filings for a short period of time 
if we experience any prolonged difficulties with our web based tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season  we could lose current and future customers  receive negative publicity and incur increased operating costs  any of which could have a significant negative impact on the financial and market success of these businesses and have a negative impact on our near term and long term financial results 
if actual product returns exceed returns reserves  or if actual customer rebate redemptions exceed rebate reserves  our revenue would be lower 
we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell  in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers will run out of products 
this is particularly true for our consumer tax products  which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters 
like many software companies that sell their products through distributors and retailers  we have historically accepted significant product returns 
we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements  based on estimated future returns of products 
we closely monitor levels of product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain reserves that are adequate to cover expected returns 
in the past  returns have not generally exceeded these reserves 
however  if we do experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves  it would result in lower net revenue 
for example  if we had increased our fiscal returns reserves by of non consignment sales to retailers for quickbooks  turbotax and quicken  our fiscal total net revenue would have been approximately million lower 
in addition  our policy of recognizing revenue from distributors and retailers upon delivery of product for non consignment sales is predicated upon our 
table of contents ability to reasonably estimate returns 
if we do not continue to demonstrate our ability to estimate returns then our revenue recognition policy for these types of sales may no longer be appropriate 
we also offer customer rebates as part of our selling efforts and establish reserves through a charge to revenue for estimated future payments of rebates 
historically  a percentage of customers do not submit requests for their rebates 
rebate redemption rates are going up because we  along with certain retailers  are making it easier for customers to claim rebates 
while we have taken this trend into account in determining our rebate reserves  if a greater number of eligible customers seek rebates than for which we have provided reserves our margins will be adversely affected 
if rebate redemptions for our quickbooks  turbotax and quicken products were to increase by  our annual total net revenue would decrease by approximately million 
we are continuing to enhance our new information systems  which we use to manage our business and finance operations  and problems with the design or implementation of these enhancements could interfere with our business and operations 
in september we implemented new information systems that manage our business and finance operations 
during the course of the conversion we upgraded significant financial systems  order taking systems  middleware systems systems that allow for interoperability of different databases and network security systems 
while we were able to complete the processing requirements of our peak business season in fiscal  we experienced some system related slowdowns 
consequently  we believe that we need to further enhance and upgrade the systems over the next several months to improve performance and support our future growth 
in the event that we are unable to expand the capabilities of our systems  our ability to grow our business will be limited 
the expenditures associated with the expansion and upgrade of our systems could be significant 
problems with the design or implementation of these system enhancements could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely and accurate manner take customer orders  ship products  provide services and support to our customers  bill and track our customers  fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business 
our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and our quarterly results fluctuate significantly 
several of our businesses are highly seasonal causing significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results 
revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending january and april due to our tax businesses contributing most of their revenue during those quarters and the timing of the release of our small business software upgrades 
we experience lower revenues  and significant operating losses  in the first and fourth quarters ending october and july for example  in the second and third quarters of our last two fiscal years we had total net revenue of between million and million while in our first and fourth fiscal quarters we had total net revenue of between million and million 
our financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors  including changes in product sales mix that affect average selling prices  product release dates  the timing of our discontinuance of support for older product offerings  the timing of sales of our higher priced intuit branded small business offerings  our methods for distributing our products  including the shift to a consignment model for some of our desktop products sold through retail distribution channels  the inclusion of upgrades with certain offerings which can impact the pattern of revenue recognition  and the timing of acquisitions  divestitures  and goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges 
as our product and service offerings become more complex our revenue streams may become less predictable 
our expanding range of products and services generates more varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses 
the accounting policies that apply to these revenue streams are more complex than those that apply to our traditional products and services 
we expect this trend to continue as we acquire additional companies and expand our offerings 
for example  as we begin to offer additional features and options as part of multiple element revenue arrangements  we could be required to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue at the time of sale than we do for traditional products 
this would decrease recognized revenue at the time products are shipped  but result in increased recognized 
table of contents revenue in fiscal periods after shipment 
in addition  our intuit branded small business segment businesses offer products and services with significantly higher prices than our traditional core business software products 
revenue from these offerings tends to be less predictable than revenue from our traditional desktop products due to longer sales and implementation cycles  which could cause our quarterly revenue from these businesses to fluctuate 
acquisition related costs and impairment charges can cause significant fluctuation in our net income 
our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses  including amortization of purchased assets which is reflected in cost of revenue  as well as charges for in process research and development  impairment of goodwill  amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets and charges for deferred compensation which are reflected in operating expenses 
total acquisition related costs in the categories identified above were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal although under current accounting rules goodwill is no longer amortized  we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions 
we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
for example  at the end of fiscal we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of million related to our intuit public sector solutions business 
as of july  we had goodwill of million and unamortized purchased intangible assets of million on our balance sheet  both of which could be subject to impairment charges in the future 
new acquisitions  and any impairment of the value of purchased assets  could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 
if we do not respond promptly and effectively to customer service and technical support inquiries we will lose customers and our revenues will decline 
the effectiveness of our customer service and technical support operations are critical to customer satisfaction and our financial success 
if we do not respond effectively to service and technical support requests we will lose customers and miss revenue opportunities  such as paid service  product renewals and new product sales 
in our service offerings  such as our merchant card processing and outsourced payroll businesses  customer service delivery is fundamental to retaining and maintaining existing customers and acquiring new customers 
we occasionally experience customer service and technical support problems  including longer than expected waiting times for customers when our staffing and systems are inadequate to handle a higher than anticipated volume of requests 
we also risk losing service at any one of our customer contact centers and our redundancy systems could prove inadequate to provide backup support 
training and retaining qualified customer service and technical support personnel is particularly challenging due to the expansion of our product offerings and the seasonality of our tax business 
for example  in fiscal the number of our consumer tax service representatives ranged from during off season months to about at the peak of the season 
if we do not adequately train our support representatives our customers will not receive the level of support that they demand and we strive to deliver 
to improve our performance in this area  we must eliminate underlying causes of service and support requests through product improvements  better order fulfillment processes  more robust self help tools  and improved ability to accurately anticipate demand for support 
implementing any of these improvements can be expensive  time consuming and ultimately prove unsuccessful 
if we do not deliver the high level of support that our customers expect for any of the reasons stated above we will lose customers and our financial results will suffer 
if we encounter problems with our third party customer service and technical support providers our business will be harmed and our margins will decline 
we outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to domestic and international third party service providers  including to service providers in india 
during fiscal we greatly increased the number of third party customer service representatives working on our behalf and we 
table of contents expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future 
this strategy provides us with lower operating costs and greater flexibility  but also presents risks to our business  including the following international outsourcing has received considerable negative attention in the media and there are indications that the us congress may pass legislation that would impact how we operate and impact customer perceptions of our service 
for example  in congress legislators have discussed restricting the flow of personal information to overseas providers and requiring representatives in foreign jurisdictions to affirmatively identify themselves by name and location  customers may react negatively to providing information to and receiving support from overseas organizations  we may not be able to impact the quality of support that we provide as directly as we are able to in our company run call centers  in recent years india has experienced political instability and changing policies that may impact our operations 
in addition  for a number of years india and pakistan have been in conflict and an active state of war between the two countries could disrupt our services  and we rely on a global communications infrastructure that may be interrupted in a number of ways 
for example  in fiscal we had to reroute calls to india due to an underwater cable being cut in the mediterranean sea 
we depend upon a small number of larger retailers to generate a significant portion of our sales volume for our desktop software products 
we sell most of our desktop software products through our retail distribution channel and a relatively small number of larger retailers generate a significant portion of our sales volume 
our principal retailers have significant bargaining leverage due to their size and available resources 
any change in principal business terms  termination or major disruption of our relationship with these resellers could result in a potentially significant decline in our revenues and earnings 
for example  the sourcing decisions  product display locations and promotional activities that retailers undertake can greatly impact the sales of our products 
due to its seasonal nature  sales of turbotax are particularly impacted by such decisions and if our principal distribution sources were to elect to carry or promote competitive products our revenues would decline 
the fact that we also sell our products directly could cause retailers to reduce their efforts to promote our products or stop selling our products altogether 
if any of our retailers run into financial difficulties we may be unable to collect amounts that we are owed 
selling new products may be more challenging and costlier than selling our historical products  causing our margins to decline 
because our strategy for some of our products involves the routine introduction of new products at retail  if retailers do not offer our new products we will not be able to grow as planned 
an outcome of our right for me marketing approach is the introduction of additional versions of our products 
retailers may be reluctant to stock unproven products  or products that sell at higher prices  but more slowly 
retailers may also choose to place less emphasis on software as a category within their stores 
in addition  it may be costlier for us to market and sell some of our higher priced products due to our need to convey the more customer specific value of the products to customers rather than communicating more generalized benefits 
this may require us to develop other marketing programs that supplement our traditional in store promotional efforts to sell these products to customers causing our margins to shrink 
if retail distribution proves an ineffective channel for certain of our new offerings it could adversely impact our growth  revenue and profitability 
if our manufacturing and distribution suppliers execute poorly our business will be harmed 
we have chosen to outsource the manufacturing and distribution of many of our desktop software products to a small number of third party providers and we use a single vendor to produce and distribute our check and business forms supplies products 
although our reliance on a small number of suppliers  or a single supplier  provides us with efficiencies and enhanced bargaining power  poor performance by or lack of effective communication with these parties can significantly harm our business 
this risk is amplified by 
table of contents the fact that we carry very little inventory and rely on just in time manufacturing processes 
we mitigate this risk by managing our second tier vendors and maintaining contingency plans 
we have experienced problems with our suppliers in the past 
for example  during fiscal one of our suppliers was unable to fulfill orders for some of our software products for a number of days due to operational difficulties and communication errors 
although together we were able to mitigate the impact of that delay with minimal disruption to our business  if we experience longer delays  delays during a peak demand period or significant quality issues our business could be significantly harmed 
failure to maintain the availability and security of the systems  networks  databases and software required to operate and deliver our internet based products and services could adversely affect our operating results 
our internet based product and service offerings  including quickbooks online edition  quickbooks assisted payroll service  complete web based payroll  turbo tax for the web  consumer and professional electronic tax filing services  quicken 
com and quickbase  rely on a variety of systems  networks and databases  many of which are maintained by us at our data centers 
in order to prevent interruptions to the availability of our internet based products and services  we generally follow industry standard practices for creating a fault tolerant environment 
however  we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems 
we maintain back up processing capabilities that are designed to protect us against site related disasters for many of our mission critical applications 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect against down time for our internet based products and services  we do occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties 
in order to provide our internet based products and services  we must protect the security of our systems  networks  databases and software 
like all companies that deliver products and services via the internet  we are subject to attack by computer hackers who develop and deploy software that is designed to penetrate the security of our systems and networks 
a hacker who is able to penetrate our security systems could misappropriate or damage our proprietary information or cause disruptions in the delivery of our products and services 
we believe that we have taken steps to protect against such attacks 
however  there can be no assurance that our security measures will not be penetrated by experienced hackers 
in the event that the systems  networks  databases and software required to deliver our internet based products and services become unavailable or suffer technical difficulties or a breach in security  we may be required to expend significant resources to alleviate these problems  and our operating results could suffer 
in addition  any such interruption or breach of security could damage our reputation and lead to the loss of customers 
failure of our information technology systems or those of our service providers could adversely affect our future operating results 
we rely on a variety of internal technology systems and technology systems maintained by our outside manufacturing and distribution suppliers to take and fulfill customer orders  handle customer service requests  host our web based activities  support internal operations  and store customer and company data 
these systems could be damaged or interrupted  preventing us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or otherwise interrupting our business 
in addition  these systems could suffer security breaches  causing company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed 
any of these occurrences could adversely impact our operations 
we have experienced system challenges in the past 
for example  during fiscal some of our non critical systems were interrupted due to computer viruses that caused loss of productivity and added expense 
we also experience computer server failures from time to time 
to prevent interruptions we must continually upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we have adequate recoverability both of which are costly and time consuming 
while we and our outside service partners have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations  not all systems upon which we rely are fully redundant and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities 
possession and use of personal customer information by our businesses presents risks and expenses that could harm our business 
a number of our businesses possess personal customer information  including credit card numbers 
we use commercially available encryption technology to transmit customer information when orders are placed over the internet 
however  there can be no assurance that a third party will not be able to circumvent 
table of contents these security measures 
possession and use of personal customer information in conducting our business subjects us to regulatory burdens and potential lawsuits 
we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols and there is a trend toward greater regulation of privacy 
for example  regulations like the recently created federal do not call list  and actions by internet service providers to limit communications with their subscribers may impede our ability to communicate with our customers and increase our compliance costs 
because our businesses rely heavily on direct marketing  any limitations on our ability to communicate with our customers could harm our financial results 
in the past we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues and we could face similar suits in the future 
a major breach of customer privacy or security by intuit  or even another company  could have serious negative consequences for our businesses  including direct damages that we may be required to pay as a result of a breach by us  reduced customer demand for our services  damage to our reputation and additional regulation by federal or state agencies 
although we have sophisticated network security  internal control measures  and physical security procedures to safeguard customer information  there can be no assurance that a data security breach or theft will not occur resulting in harm to our business and results of operations 
we are exposed to risks associated with credit card fraud and credit card processing and payment 
many of our customers use credit cards to pay for our services 
we have suffered losses  and may continue to suffer losses  as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data 
under current credit card practices  we may be liable for fraudulent credit card transactions if we do not obtain a cardholder s signature  a frequent practice in internet sales 
we employ technology solutions to help us detect fraudulent credit card transactions 
however  the failure to detect or control credit card fraud could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may exploit our innovations  which could weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenues 
our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trade secret  trademark  patent  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  contractors  distributors and corporate partners and into license agreements with respect to our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
effectively creating and protecting our proprietary rights is expensive and may require us to engage in costly and distracting litigation 
despite these precautions  third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization 
because we outsource significant aspects of our product development  manufacturing and distribution we are at risk that confidential portions of our intellectual property could become public by lapses in security by our contractors 
we have licensed in the past  and expect to license in the future  certain of our proprietary rights  such as trademarks or copyrighted material  to others 
these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation 
it is also possible that other companies could successfully challenge the validity or scope of our patents and that our patent portfolio  which is relatively small  may not provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage 
ultimately  our attempts to secure legal protection for our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technologies  duplicate our products  or design around patents and other intellectual property rights 
if our intellectual property protection proves inadequate we could lose our competitive advantage and our financial results will suffer 
we expect copying and misuse of our intellectual property to be a persistent problem causing lost revenue and increased expenses 
our intellectual property rights are among our most valuable assets 
policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult  expensive  and time consuming 
current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection 
we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
for example  we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online auction sites and other 
table of contents online marketplaces 
in addition  efforts to protect our intellectual property may be misunderstood and perceived negatively by our customers 
for example  during we employed technology to prohibit unauthorized sharing of our turbotax products 
these efforts were not effectively communicated causing a negative reaction by some of our customers who misunderstood our actions 
although we continue to evaluate technology solutions to piracy  and we continue to increase our civil and criminal enforcement efforts  we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 
although we are unable to quantify the extent of piracy of our software products  software piracy may depress our net revenues 
we engage in efforts to educate consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and to educate lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected  and we cooperate with the software information industry association in their efforts to combat piracy 
however  these efforts may not affect the piracy of our products 
we do not own all of the software  other technologies and content used in our products and services 
many of our products are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties 
we believe we have all of the necessary licenses from third parties to use and distribute third party technology and content that we do not own that is used in our current products and services 
from time to time we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties or negotiate with new third parties to include their technology or content in our existing products  in new versions of our existing products or in wholly new products 
we may not be able to negotiate or renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use or continue to use third party technology or content in our products and services  we may not be able to sell the affected products  which would in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results 
third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 
from time to time  we have received claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others 
as the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap  and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses  we believe that we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims  including patent  copyright  and trademark infringement claims 
we expect that software products in general will increasingly be subject to these claims as the number of products and competitors increase  the functionality of products overlap and as the patenting of software functionality continues to grow 
we have  from time to time  received allegations of patent infringement claims in the past and may receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our products infringe upon patents held by third parties 
the receipt of a notice alleging infringement may require us to obtain a costly opinion of counsel to prevent an allegation of intentional infringement 
future claims could present an exposure of uncertain magnitude 
we believe that we would be able to obtain any necessary licenses or other rights to disputed intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms 
however  the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and  regardless of outcome  any such claim  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s time and attention from our business  require us to stop selling  to delay shipping or to redesign our products  or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing arrangements  or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers 
our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights  or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business 
in addition  we license and use software from third parties in our business 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms 
also  these third parties may from time to time receive claims that they have infringed the intellectual property rights of others  including patent and copyright infringement claims  which may affect our ability to continue licensing their software 
our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents our acquisition activity could disrupt our ongoing business and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 
we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies  products and technologies that complement our strategic direction 
these acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties  including inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards  controls  policies  and procedures  distraction of management s attention away from normal business operations  challenges retaining the key employees of the acquired operation  insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed  expenses associated with the acquisition  and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process  including product quality issues and legal contingencies 
acquisitions are inherently risky 
we can not be certain that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the conduct  operating results or financial condition of our business 
we have generally paid cash for our recent acquisitions 
if we issue common stock or other equity related purchase rights as consideration in an acquisition  current shareholders percentage ownership and earnings per share may become diluted 
if we fail to operate our outsourced payroll business effectively our revenue and profitability will be harmed 
our payroll business handles a significant amount of dollar and transaction volume 
due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately 
despite our efforts  it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated 
in addition to any direct damages and fines that any such problems would create  which could be substantial  the loss of customer confidence in our accuracy and controls would seriously harm our business 
our payroll business has grown largely through acquisitions and our systems are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale 
we must constantly continue to upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we process customer data in an accurate  reliable and timely manner 
these upgrades must also meet the various regulatory requirements and deadlines associated with employer related payroll activities 
any failure of our systems or processes in critical switch over times  such as in january when many businesses elect to change payroll service providers  would be detrimental to our business 
if we failed to timely deliver any of our payroll products  it could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitor s product for that year s payroll and not to purchase intuit products in the future 
to generate sustained growth in our payroll business we must successfully develop and manage a more proactive inside and field sales operation 
if these efforts are not successful our revenue growth and profitability will decline 
interest income attributable to payroll customer deposits may fluctuate or be eliminated  causing our revenue and profitability to decline 
we currently record revenue from interest earned on customer deposits that we hold pending payment of funds to taxing authorities or to customers employees 
if interest rates decline  or there are regulatory changes that diminish the amount of time that we are required or permitted to hold such funds  our interest revenue will decline 
we face a number of risks in our merchant card processing business that could result in a reduction in our revenues and profits 
our merchant card processing service business is subject to the following risks if merchants for whom we process credit card transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments  
table of contents we will not be able to conduct our business if the bank sponsors and card payment processors and other service providers that we rely on to process bank card transactions terminate their relationships with us and we are not able to secure or successfully migrate our business elsewhere  we could be required to stop providing payment processing services for visa and mastercard if we or our bank sponsors fail to adhere to the standards of the visa and mastercard credit card associations  we depend on independent sales organizations  some of which do not serve us exclusively  to acquire and retain merchant accounts  our profit margins will be reduced if for competitive reasons we cannot increase our fees at times when visa and mastercard increase the fees that we pay to process merchant transactions through their systems  unauthorized disclosure of merchant and cardholder data  whether through breach of our computer systems or otherwise  could expose us to protracted and costly litigation  and we may encounter difficulties scaling our business systems to support our growth 
should any of these risks be realized our business could be harmed and our financial results will suffer 
increased state tax filing mandates  such as the required use of specific technologies  could significantly increase our costs 
we are required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services 
changes in state imposed requirements by one or more of the states  including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards  could significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and could prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 
we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 
much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel  including members of our executive team  and those in technical  marketing and staff positions 
experienced personnel in the software and services industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense  especially in silicon valley and san diego  california  where the majority of our employees are located 
although we strive to be an employer of choice  we may not be able to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel which would cause our business to suffer 
our insurance policies are costly  may be inadequate and potentially expose us to unrecoverable risks 
insurance availability  coverage terms and pricing continue to vary with market conditions 
we endeavor to obtain appropriate insurance coverage for insurable risks that we identify  however  we may fail to correctly anticipate or quantify insurable risks  we may not be able to obtain appropriate insurance coverage  and insurers may not respond as we intend to cover insurable events that may occur 
we have observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance 
such conditions have resulted in higher premium costs  higher policy deductibles  and lower coverage limits 
for some risks  because of cost or availability  we do not have insurance coverage 
for these reasons  we are retaining a greater portion of insurable risks than we have in the past at relatively greater cost 
required expensing of stock options will significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share 
although we were not previously required to record any compensation expense in connection with option grants to employees that have an exercise price at or above fair market value  a change in generally accepted accounting principles requires us to treat all employee stock options as compensation expense beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the increased compensation expense will significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share under generally accepted accounting principles 
see recent accounting pronouncements earlier in this item 
table of contents we are frequently a party to litigation that is costly to defend and consumes the time of our management 
due to our financial position and the large number of customers that we serve we are often forced to defend litigation 
for example  we are currently being sued in an action for claims related to quicken brokerage powered by siebert  a strategic alliance between the two companies 
although we believe that this case has no merit and we are defending the matter vigorously  defending such matters consumes the time of our management and is expensive for intuit 
even though we often seek insurance coverage for litigation defense costs  there is no assurance that our defense costs  which can be substantial  will be covered in all cases 
in addition  by its nature  litigation is unpredictable and we may not prevail even in cases where we strongly believe a plaintiff s case has no valid claims 
if we do not prevail in litigation we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages or alter our business operations 
regardless of the outcome  litigation is expensive and consumes the time of our management and may ultimately reduce our income 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results 
our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our stock price may be volatile 
our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of our announcements and those of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these factors  as well as general economic and political conditions  may materially adversely affect the market price of our stock in the future 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately  which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to detect and prevent fraud 
we periodically assess our system of internal controls  and the internal controls of service providers upon which we rely  to review their effectiveness and identify potential areas of improvement 
these assessments may conclude that enhancements  modifications or changes to our system of internal controls are necessary 
in addition  from time to time we acquire businesses  many of which have limited infrastructure and systems of internal controls 
performing assessments of internal controls  implementing necessary changes  and maintaining an effective internal controls process is expensive and requires considerable management attention  particularly in the case of newly acquired entities 
internal control systems are designed in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and all such systems  however well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  and not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the system are met 
because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems  there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  regardless of how remote 
if we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls or prevent fraud  we could suffer losses  could be subject to costly litigation  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our brand and operating results could be harmed  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act  we and our independent registered public accounting firm must certify the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting annually 
identification of material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting by us or our independent registered public accounting firm could adversely affect our competitive position in our business  especially our outsourced payroll business  and the market price for our common stock 

table of contents business interruptions could adversely affect our future operating results 
several of our major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake  fire  power shortages  terrorist attacks and other hostile acts  and other events beyond our control 
the majority of our research and development activities  our corporate headquarters  our principal information technology systems  and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults 
we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake related losses 
while we maintain disaster recovery facilities for most of our data centers that support the information systems  networks and databases that are necessary to operate our business  we are still in the process of establishing disaster recovery facilities for some of our data centers 
our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or man made disaster

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment portfolio we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers 
our investments and funds held for payroll customers consist of instruments that meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy 
this policy specifies that  except for direct obligations of the united states government  securities issued by agencies of the united states government  and money market or cash management funds  we diversify our holdings by limiting our investments and funds held for payroll customers with any individual issuer 
the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments as of july  by stated maturity 
the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents and investments that are part of funds held for payroll customers on our balance sheet 
cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds 
approximately of our available for sale debt securities have an interest reset date  put date or mandatory call date within one year 
as of july  the weighted average interest rate earned on our money market accounts was and the weighted average interest rate earned on our investments was 
years ending july  and thereafter total in thousands cash equivalents investments interest rate risk our cash equivalents and our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents  investments and funds held for payroll customers and the value of those investments 
should interest rates increase by or about basis points from the levels of july   the value of our investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately million 
should interest rates increase by basis points from the levels of july   the value of our investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately million 
impact of foreign currency rate changes since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars and british pounds into us dollars for financial reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results 
the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies 
due primarily to the effect of the weakening us dollar on intercompany balances with our canadian subsidiary  we recorded foreign currency exchange gains of million in fiscal and million in fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  we converted a significant portion of our canadian intercompany balances to long term investments in that subsidiary  which reduced our statement of operations exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we recorded a nominal foreign currency exchange loss in fiscal although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future  there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future 
as of july  we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
