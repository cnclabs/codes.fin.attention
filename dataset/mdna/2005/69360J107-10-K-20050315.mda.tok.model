item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources non gaap supplemental disclosure measure funds from operations  for a reconciliation of ffo and net income allocable to common shareholders and for information on why the company presents ffo 
perpetual preferred stock units the primary source of leverage in the company s capital structure is perpetual preferred stock or the equivalent preferred units in the operating partnership 
this method of financing eliminates interest rate and refinancing risks because the dividend rate is fixed and the stated value or capital contribution is not required to be repaid 
in addition  the consequences of defaulting on required preferred distributions is less severe than with debt 
the preferred shareholders may elect additional two directors if six quarterly distributions go unpaid  whether or not consecutive 
debt financing the company has used debt financing to a limited degree 
the primary source of debt that the company relies upon to provide short term capital is its million unsecured line of credit with well fargo 
in the past  the company also had an unsecured term loan in the amount of million 
this term loan was repaid in from time to time  the company has also borrowed funds on a short term basis from public storage  inc access to acquisition capital the company seeks to maintain a minimum ratio of ffo to combined fixed charges and preferred distributions paid of to fixed charges include interest expense and capitalized interest 
preferred distributions include amounts paid to preferred shareholders and preferred operating partnership unitholders 
as of the year ended december   the ffo to combined fixed charges and preferred distributions paid ratio was to  excluding the effects of eitf topic d in addition  the company believes that its financial position will enable it to access capital to finance its future growth 
subject to market conditions  the company may add leverage to its capital structure 
competition competition in the market areas in which many of the company s properties are located is significant and has reduced the occupancy levels and rental rates of  and increased the operating expenses of  certain of these properties 
competition may be accelerated by any increase in availability of funds for investment in real estate 
barriers to entry are relatively low for those with the necessary capital and the company competes for property acquisitions and tenants with entities that have greater financial resources than the company 
recent increases in sublease space and unleased developments are expected to further intensify competition among operators in certain market areas in which the company operates 
the company s properties compete for tenants with similar properties located in its markets primarily on the basis of location  rent charged  services provided and the design and condition of improvements 
the company believes it possesses several distinguishing characteristics that enable it to compete effectively in the flex  office and industrial space markets 
the company believes its personnel are among the most experienced in these real estate markets 
the company s facilities are part of a comprehensive system encompassing standardized procedures and integrated reporting and information networks 
the company believes that the significant operating and financial experience of its executive officers and directors combined with the company s capital structure  national investment scope  geographic diversity and economies of scale should enable the company to compete effectively 
investments in real estate facilities as of december   the company owned and operated approximately million net rentable square feet compared to million net rentable square feet at december  the net decrease in net rentable square feet was due to the disposition of facilities that were identified by management as not meeting the company s ongoing investment strategy  partially offset by the acquisition of the property in fairfax  virginia 
summary of business model the company has a diversified portfolio 
it is diversified geographically in eight states and has a diversified customer mix by size and industry concentration 
the company believes that this diversification combined with a conservative financing strategy  focus on markets with strong demographics for growth and operating strategy gives the company a business model that mitigates risk and provides strong long term growth opportunities

in addition  the company is limited in its ability to incur additional borrowings the company is required to maintain unencumbered assets with an aggregate book value equal to or greater than two times the company s unsecured recourse debt  the company did not have any unsecured recourse debt at december  or sell assets 
the company was in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility at december  in february  the company repaid  in full  the million outstanding on a million unsecured term note agreement with fleet national bank 
the company incurred interest at libor plus per annum 
during july   the company entered into an interest rate swap transaction which resulted in a fixed libor rate of for the term loan resulting in an all in rate of per annum on the term loan 
the unsecured note required the company to meet covenants that were substantially the same as the covenants in the credit facility 
as of december   the company had million in short term borrowings from psi

facilities operated by the company have historically been covered by comprehensive insurance  including fire  earthquake  liability and extended coverage from nationally recognized carriers 
item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered in evaluating our company and our business 
public storage has significant influence over us 
at december   public storage and its affiliates owned of the outstanding shares of our common stock upon conversion of its interest in our operating partnership and of the outstanding common units of our operating partnership of the common units not owned by us 
also  ronald l 
havner  jr  our chairman of the board  is also vice chairman  chief executive officer and a director of public storage and harvey lenkin  one of our directors  is president  chief operating officer  and a director of public storage 
consequently  public storage has the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders  including electing directors  changing our articles of incorporation  dissolving and approving other extraordinary transactions such as mergers  and all matters requiring the consent of the limited partners of the operating partnership 
in addition  public storage s ownership may make it more difficult for another party to take over our company without public storage s approval 
provisions in our organizational documents may prevent changes in control 
our articles generally prohibit owning more than of our shares our articles of incorporation restrict the number of shares that may be owned by any other person  and the partnership agreement of our operating partnership contains an anti takeover provision 
no shareholder other than public storage and certain other specified shareholders may own more than of the outstanding shares of our common stock  unless our board of directors waives this limitation 
we imposed this limitation to avoid  to the extent possible  a concentration of ownership that might jeopardize our ability to qualify as a reit 
this limitation  however  also makes a change of control much more difficult if not impossible even if it may be favorable to our public shareholders 
these provisions will prevent future takeover attempts not approved by public storage even if a majority of our public shareholders consider it to be in their best interests because they would receive a premium for their shares over the shares then market value or for other reasons 
our board can set the terms of certain securities without shareholder approval our board of directors is authorized  without shareholder approval  to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and up to  shares of equity stock  in each case in one or more series 
our board has the right to set the terms of each of these series of stock 
consequently  the board could set the terms of a series of stock that could make it difficult if not impossible for another party to take over our company even if it might be favorable to our public shareholders 
our articles of incorporation also contain other provisions that could have the same effect 
we can also cause our operating partnership to issue additional interests for cash or in exchange for property 
the partnership agreement of our operating partnership restricts mergers the partnership agreement of our operating partnership generally provides that we may not merge or engage in a similar transaction unless the limited partners of our operating partnership are entitled to receive the same proportionate payments as our shareholders 
in addition  we have agreed not to merge unless the merger would have been approved had the limited partners been able to vote together with our shareholders  which has the effect of increasing public storage s influence over us due to public storage s ownership of operating partnership units 
these provisions may make it more difficult for us to merge with another entity 
our operating partnership poses additional risks to us 
limited partners of our operating partnership  including public storage  have the right to vote on certain changes to the partnership agreement 
they may vote in a way that is against the interests of our shareholders 
also  as general partner of our operating partnership  we are required to protect the interests of the limited partners of the operating partnership 
the interests of the limited partners and of our shareholders may differ 
we cannot sell certain properties without public storage s approval 
prior to  we are prohibited from selling specified properties without public storage s approval 
since public storage would be taxed on a sale of these properties  the interests of public storage and our other shareholders may differ as to the best time to sell such properties 
we would incur adverse tax consequences if we fail to qualify as a reit 
our cash flow would be reduced if we fail to qualify as a reit while we believe that we have qualified since to be taxed as a reit  and will continue to be so qualified  we cannot be certain 
to continue to qualify as a reit  we need to satisfy certain requirements under the federal income tax laws relating to our income  assets  distributions to shareholders and shareholder base 
in this regard  the share ownership limits in our articles of incorporation do not necessarily ensure that our shareholder base is sufficiently diverse for us to qualify as a reit 
for any year we fail to qualify as a reit  we would be taxed at regular corporate tax rates on our taxable income unless certain relief provisions apply 
taxes would reduce our cash available for distributions to shareholders or for reinvestment  which could adversely affect us and our shareholders 
also we would not be allowed to elect reit status for five years after we fail to qualify unless certain relief provisions apply 
our cash flow would be reduced if our predecessor failed to qualify as a reit for us to qualify to be taxed as a reit  our predecessor  american office park properties  also needed to qualify to be taxed as a reit 
we believe american office park properties qualified as a reit beginning in until its march merger with us 
if it is determined that it did not qualify as a reit  we could also lose our reit qualification 
before  our predecessor was a taxable corporation and  to qualify as a reit  was required to distribute all of its profits before the end of while we believe american office park properties qualified as a reit since  we did not obtain an opinion of an outside expert at the time of its merger with us 
we may need to borrow funds to meet our reit distribution requirements to qualify as a reit  we must generally distribute to our shareholders of our taxable income 
our income consists primarily of our share of our operating partnership s income 
we intend to make sufficient distributions to qualify as a reit and otherwise avoid corporate tax 
however  differences in timing between income and expenses and the need to make nondeductible expenditures such as capital improvements and principal payments on debt could force us to borrow funds to make necessary shareholder distributions 
since we buy and operate real estate  we are subject to general real estate investment and operating risks 
summary of real estate risks we own and operate commercial properties and are subject to the risks of owning real estate generally and commercial properties in particular 
these risks include the national  state and local economic climate and real estate conditions  such as oversupply of or reduced demand for space and changes in market rental rates  how prospective tenants perceive the attractiveness  convenience and safety of our properties  our ability to provide adequate management  maintenance and insurance  our ability to collect rent from tenants on a timely basis  the expense of periodically renovating  repairing and reletting spaces  environmental issues  compliance with the americans with disabilities act and other federal  state  and local laws and regulations  increasing operating costs  including real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  if these increased costs cannot be passed through to tenants  changes in tax  real estate and zoning laws  increase in new commercial properties in our market  tenant defaults and bankruptcies  tenant s right to sublease space  and concentration of properties leased to non rated private companies 
certain significant costs  such as mortgage payments  real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance  generally are not reduced even when a property s rental income is reduced 
in addition  environmental and tax laws  interest rate levels  the availability of financing and other factors may affect real estate values and property income 
furthermore  the supply of commercial space fluctuates with market conditions 
if our properties do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses  including any debt service  tenant improvements  leasing commissions and other capital expenditures  we may have to borrow additional amounts to cover fixed costs  and we may have to reduce our distributions to shareholders 
we recently acquired a large property in a new market in december  we acquired an industrial park in miami  florida 
this is our only property in this market and represents approximately of our portfolio s aggregate net rentable square footage at december  as a result of our lack of experience with the miami market and other factors  the operating performance of this property may be less than we anticipate  and we may have difficulty in integrating this property into our existing portfolio 
we may encounter significant delays and expense in reletting vacant space  or we may not be able to relet space at existing rates  in each case resulting in losses of income when leases expire  we will incur expenses in retrofitting space and we may not be able to release the space on the same terms 
certain leases provide tenants with the right to terminate early if they pay a fee 
our properties as of december  generally have lower vacancy rates than the average for the markets in which they are located  and leases accounting for of our annual rental income expire in and in while we have estimated our cost of renewing leases that expire in and  our estimates could be wrong 
if we are unable to release space promptly  if the terms are significantly less favorable than anticipated or if the costs are higher  we may have to reduce our distributions to shareholders 
tenant defaults and bankruptcies may reduce our cash flow and distributions we may have difficulty in collecting from tenants in default  particularly if they declare bankruptcy 
this could affect our cash flow and distributions to shareholders 
since many of our tenants are non rated private companies  this risk may be enhanced 
the company has a lease with footstar that generates less than of our revenues 
footstar and its affiliates filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy laws in in connection with such filing  they rejected one of two leases with the company 
the rejected lease consisted of approximately  square feet in dallas  texas  with annual rents of approximately  no action has been taken with respect to the second lease of  square feet  with annual rents of approximately  in september  we restructured a  square foot lease with a previous top ten tenant in northern california that reset the term to years and reduced the initial monthly rents by approximately  per month  with annual increases thereafter 
given the historical uncertainty of the tenant s ability to meet its lease obligations  we will continue to reserve any income that would have been realized on a straight line basis 
several other tenants have contacted us  requesting early termination of their lease  reduction in space under lease  rent deferment or abatement 
at this time  the company cannot anticipate what impact  if any  the ultimate outcome of these discussions will have on our operating results 
we may be adversely affected by significant competition among commercial properties many other commercial properties compete with our properties for tenants 
some of the competing properties may be newer and better located than our properties 
we also expect that new properties will be built in our markets 
also  we compete with other buyers  many of whom are larger than us  for attractive commercial properties 
therefore  we may not be able to grow as rapidly as we would like 
we may be adversely affected if casualties to our properties are not covered by insurance we carry insurance on our properties that we believe is comparable to the insurance carried by other operators for similar properties 
however  we could suffer uninsured losses or losses in excess of policy limits for such occurrences such as earthquakes that adversely affect us or even result in loss of the property 
we might still remain liable on any mortgage debt or other unsatisfied obligations related to that property 
the illiquidity of our real estate investments may prevent us from adjusting our portfolio to respond to market changes there may be delays and difficulties in selling real estate 
therefore  we cannot easily change our portfolio when economic conditions change 
also  tax laws limit a reit s ability to sell properties held for less than four years 
we may be adversely affected by changes in laws increases in income and service taxes may reduce our cash flow and ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders 
our properties are also subject to various federal  state and local regulatory requirements  such as state and local fire and safety codes 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  governmental authorities could fine us or courts could award damages against us 
we believe our properties comply with all significant legal requirements 
however  these requirements could change in a way that would reduce our cash flow and ability to make distributions to shareholders 
we may incur significant environmental remediation costs under various federal  state and local environmental laws  an owner or operator of real estate may have to clean spills or other releases of hazardous or toxic substances on or from a property 
certain environmental laws impose liability whether or not the owner knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
in some cases  liability may exceed the value of the property 
the presence of toxic substances  or the failure to properly remedy any resulting contamination  may make it more difficult for the owner or operator to sell  lease or operate its property or to borrow money using its property as collateral 
future environmental laws may impose additional material liabilities on us 
we are affected by the americans with disabilities act 
the americans with disabilities act of requires that access and use by disabled persons of all public accommodations and commercial properties be facilitated 
existing commercial properties must be made accessible to disabled persons 
while we have not estimated the cost of complying with this act  we do not believe the cost will be material 
we have an ongoing program to bring our properties into what we believe is compliance with the american with disabilities act 
we depend on external sources of capital to grow our company 
we are generally required under the internal revenue code to distribute at least of our taxable income 
because of this distribution requirement  we may not be able to fund future capital needs  including any necessary building and tenant improvements  from operating cash flow 
consequently  we may need to rely on third party sources of capital to fund our capital needs 
we may not be able to obtain the financing on favorable terms or at all 
access to third party sources of capital depends  in part  on general market conditions  the market s perception of our growth potential  our current and expected future earnings  our cash flow  and the market price per share of our common stock 
if we cannot obtain capital from third party sources  we may not be able to acquire properties when strategic opportunities exist  satisfy any debt service obligations  or make cash distributions to shareholders 
our ability to control our properties may be adversely affected by ownership through partnerships and joint ventures 
we own most of our properties through our operating partnership 
our organizational documents do not prevent us from acquiring properties with others through partnerships or joint ventures 
this type of investment may present additional risks 
for example  our partners may have interests that differ from ours or that conflict with ours  or our partners may become bankrupt 
during  we entered into a joint venture arrangement that held property subject to debt 
this joint venture has been liquidated and all debts paid  however  we may enter into similar arrangements with the same partner or other partners 
we can change our business policies and increase our level of debt without shareholder approval 
our board of directors establishes our investment  financing  distribution and our other business policies and may change these policies without shareholder approval 
our organizational documents do not limit our level of debt 
a change in our policies or an increase in our level of debt could adversely affect our operations or the price of our common stock 
we can issue additional securities without shareholder approval 
we can issue preferred  equity and common stock without shareholder approval 
holders of preferred stock have priority over holders of common stock  and the issuance of additional shares of stock reduces the interest of existing holders in our company 
increases in interest rates may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
one of the factors that influences the market price of our common stock is the annual rate of distributions that we pay on our common stock  as compared with interest rates 
an increase in interest rates may lead purchasers of reit shares to demand higher annual distribution rates  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
shares that become available for future sale may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
substantial sales of our common stock  or the perception that substantial sales may occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as of december   public storage owned of the outstanding shares of our common stock upon conversion of its interest in our operating partnership 
these shares  as well as shares of common stock held by certain other significant shareholders  are eligible to be sold in the public market  subject to compliance with applicable securities laws 
we depend on key personnel 
we depend on our key personnel  including ronald l 
havner  jr  our chairman of the board  and joseph d 
russell  jr  our president and chief executive officer 
the loss of mr 
havner  mr 
russell  or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations 
we maintain no key person insurance on our key personnel 
we may be affected by california s budget shortfall 
the california budget could affect our company in many ways  including the possible repeal of proposition  which could result in higher property taxes 
reduced state and local government spending and the resulting effects on the state and local economies could have an adverse impact on demand for our space 
the budget shortfall could impact our company in other ways that cannot be predicted 
approximately of our properties net operating income was generated in california for the year ended december  terrorist attacks and the possibility of wider armed conflict may have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war  such as those that took place on september   could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or its businesses or interests 
attacks or armed conflicts that directly impact one or more of our properties could significantly affect our ability to operate those properties and thereby impair our operating results 
further  we may not have insurance coverage for all losses caused by a terrorist attack 
such insurance may not be available  or if it is available and we decide to obtain such terrorist coverage  the cost for the insurance may be significant in relationship to the risk overall 
in addition  the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
finally  further terrorist acts could cause the united states to enter into a wider armed conflict which could further impact our business and operating results 
change in taxation of corporate dividends may adversely affect the value of our shares 
the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of  enacted on may   generally reduces to the maximum marginal rate of federal tax payable by individuals on dividends received from a regular c corporation 
this reduced tax rate  however  will not apply to dividends paid to individuals by a reit on its shares except for certain limited amounts 
the earnings of a reit that are distributed to its shareholders still will generally be subject to less federal income taxation on an aggregate basis than earnings of a non reit c corporation that are distributed to its shareholders net of corporate level income tax 
the jobs and growth tax act  however  could cause individual investors to view stocks of regular c corporations as more attractive relative to shares of reits than was the case prior to the enactment of the legislation because the dividends from regular c corporations  which previously were taxed at the same rate as reit dividends  now will be taxed at a maximum marginal rate of while reit dividends will be taxed at a maximum marginal rate of 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  the enactment of this legislation may have on the value of our common stock  either in terms of price or relative to other investments 
item properties as of december   the company owned approximately million square feet of flex space  million square feet of industrial space  million square feet of suburban office space concentrated primarily in eight major markets consisting of southern and northern california  southern and northern texas  florida  virginia  maryland and oregon

for more information  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
each of these properties will continue to be used for its current purpose 
competition exists in the market areas in which these properties are located 
barriers to entry are relatively low for competitors with the necessary capital and the company will be competing for properties and tenants with entities that have greater financial resources than the company 
the company believes that while overall demand for commercial space softened in and  there is sufficient demand to maintain healthy occupancy rates 
for information regarding general competitive conditions to which the company s properties are or may be subject  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview effect of economic conditions on the company s primary markets 
the company has no present plans for any material renovation  improvement or development of its properties 
the company typically renovates its properties in connection with the releasing of space to tenants and expects that it will pay the costs of such renovations from rental income 
the company has risks that tenants will default on leases and declare bankruptcy 
management believes these risks are mitigated through the company s geographic diversity and diverse tenant base 
as of december   tenants occupying approximately  square feet of commercial space had declared bankruptcy and all of the bankrupt tenants were current on their monthly rental payments 
the company evaluates the performance of its properties primarily based on net operating income noi 
noi is defined by the company as rental income as defined by gaap less cost of operations as defined by gaap

portfolio information approximately of the company s annual base rents are derived from large tenants  which consist of tenants with average leases greater or equal to  square feet 
these tenants generally sign longer leases  require greater tenant improvements  are represented by a broker and are more creditworthy tenants 
the remaining of the company s annual base rents are derived from small tenants with average space requirements of less than  square feet and a shorter lease term duration 
tenant improvements are relatively less for these tenants and most of these tenants are not represented by brokers and therefore the company does not pay lease commissions 
these tenants have lower credit profiles and delinquencies and bankruptcies are more frequent

overview the company owns and operates million rentable square feet of multi tenant flex  industrial and office properties located in eight states 
the company focuses on increasing profitability and cash flow aimed at maximizing shareholder value 
the company strives to maintain high occupancy levels while increasing rental rates when market conditions allow 
the company also acquires properties it believes will create long term value  and disposes of properties which no longer fit within the company s strategic objectives or in situations where the company believes it can optimize cash proceeds 
operating results are driven by income from rental operations and are therefore substantially influenced by rental demand for space within our properties 
in  the company continued to experience challenging commercial real estate conditions in a number of markets including dallas  texas  portland  oregon  austin  texas and northern california 
these conditions caused downward pressure on rental rates in these markets coupled with increased necessity to give rental concessions 
during  the company began to see signs of improving market conditions in the southern california  virginia  maryland and miami  florida markets 
market conditions  characterized by continued weak demand and over supply  resulted in persistent downward pressure on rental rates coupled with increased necessity to give rental concessions in a number of the company s markets 
the company experienced increasing transaction costs in despite these difficult market conditions  the company successfully leased or released million square feet of space in and achieved an overall occupancy of  as of december  however  net operating income for our same park properties decreased from the year ended december  to by million or 
see further discussion of operating results below 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  depreciation  accrual of operating expenses and accruals for contingencies  each of which we discuss below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
of the securities and exchange commission  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended 
sab requires that the following four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
all leases are classified as operating leases 
rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases 
straight line rent is recognized for all tenants with contractual increases in rent that are not included on the company s credit watch list 
deferred rent receivables represent rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis in excess of billed rents 
reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable costs are incurred 
allowance for doubtful accounts rental revenue from our tenants is our principal source of revenue 
we monitor the collectibility of our receivable balances including the deferred rent receivable on an on going basis 
based on these reviews  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of our tenants to make required rent payments to us 
tenant receivables and deferred rent receivables are carried net of the allowances for uncollectible tenant receivables and deferred rent 
as discussed below  management s determination of the adequacy of these allowances requires significant judgments and estimates 
management s estimate of the required allowance is subject to revision as the factors discussed below change and is sensitive to the effect of economic and market conditions on out tenants 
tenant receivables consist primarily of amounts due for contractual lease payments  reimbursements of common area maintenance expenses  property taxes and other expenses recoverable from tenants 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible current tenant receivables is performed using a methodology that incorporates specific identification  aging analysis  an overall evaluation of the company s historical loss trends and the current economic and business environment 
the specific identification methodology relies on factors such as the age and nature of the receivables  the payment history and financial condition of the tenant  the company s assessment of the tenant s ability to meet its lease obligations  and the status of negotiations of any disputes with the tenant 
the company s allowance also includes a reserve based on historical loss trends not associated with any specific tenant 
this reserve as well as the company s specific identification reserve is reevaluated quarterly based on economic conditions and the current business environment 
deferred rents receivable represents the amount that the cumulative straight line rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the lease agreement 
given the longer term nature of these types of receivables  management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for unbilled deferred rents receivables is based primarily on historical loss experience 
management evaluates the allowance for unbilled deferred rents receivable using a specific identification methodology for the company s significant tenants designed to assess the tenants financial condition and their ability to meet their lease obligations 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates a property for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates the whole portfolio for impairment based on current operating information 
in the event that these periodic assessments reflect that the carrying amount of a property exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest that are expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the property  the company would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of the property 
the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on subjective assumptions dependent upon future and current market conditions and events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
it requires management to make assumptions related to the property such as future rental rates  tenant allowances  operating expenditures  property taxes  capital improvements  occupancy levels  and the estimated proceeds generated from the future sale of the property 
these assumptions could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
since statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
provides that the future cash flows used in this analysis be considered on an undiscounted basis  our historically established intent to hold properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss 
if our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material 
depreciation we compute depreciation on our buildings and equipment using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of generally and years 
a significant portion of the acquisition cost of each property is allocated to building and building components usually 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to building and building components  as well as  the determination of their useful lives are based on management s estimates 
if we do not appropriately allocate to these components or we incorrectly estimate the useful lives of these components  our computation of depreciation expense may not appropriately reflect the actual impact of these costs over future periods  which will affect net income 
in addition  the net book value of real estate assets could be over or understated 
the statement of cash flows  however  would not be affected 
accruals of operating expenses the company accrues for property tax expenses  performance bonuses and other operating expenses each quarter based on historical trends and anticipated disbursements 
if these estimates are incorrect  the timing of expense recognition will be affected 
accruals for contingencies the company is exposed to business and legal liability risks with respect to events that may have occurred  but in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles has not accrued for such potential liabilities because the loss is either not probable or not estimable 
future events and the result of pending litigation could result in such potential losses becoming probable and estimable  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
effect of economic conditions on the company s operations during and  the company has been affected by the slowdown in economic activity in the united states 
these effects include a decline in occupancy rates  a reduction in market rental rates throughout the portfolio  increased rent concessions  tenant improvement allowances and lease commissions  slower than expected lease up of the company s newly acquired properties  increased tenant defaults and the termination of leases pursuant to early termination options 
the reduction in occupancies and market rental rates has been the result of several factors related to general economic conditions 
there are more businesses contracting than expanding  more businesses failing than starting up and general uncertainty for businesses  resulting in slower decision making and requests for shorter term leases 
there is also more competing vacant space  including substantial amounts of sub lease space  in many of the company s markets 
many of the company s properties have lower vacancy rates than the average rates for the markets in which they are located  consequently  the company may have difficulty in maintaining its occupancy rates as leases expire 
the company has a lease with footstar that generates less than of our revenues 
footstar and its affiliates filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy laws in in connection with such filing  they rejected one of two leases with the company 
the rejected lease consisted of approximately  square feet in dallas  texas  with annual rents of approximately  no action has been taken with respect to the second lease of  square feet  with annual rents of approximately  in september  we restructured a  square foot lease with a previous top ten tenant in northern california that reset the term to years and reduced the initial monthly rents by approximately  per month  with annual increases thereafter 
given the historical uncertainty of the tenant s ability to meet its lease obligations  we will continue to reserve any income that would have been realized on a straight line basis 
several other tenants have contacted us  requesting early termination of their lease  reduction in space under lease  rent deferment or abatement 
at this time  the company cannot anticipate what impact  if any  the ultimate outcome of these discussions will have on our operating results 
effect of economic conditions on the company s primary markets the company has concentrated its operations in nine markets 
each of these markets has been affected by the slowdown in economic activity in some way 
the company s overall view of these markets is summarized below as of december  during the year ended december   the company has seen rental rates on new leases and renewed leases decrease by an average of from the most recent in place rents prior to renewal or replacements 
the company has compiled the market occupancy information set forth below using third party reports for these respective markets 
these sources are deemed to be reliable by the company  but there can be no assurance that these reports are accurate 
the company owns approximately million square feet in southern california 
this is one of the more stable markets in the country but continues to experience relatively flat rental rates 
vacancy rates have decreased slightly throughout southern california for flex  industrial and office space  and range from to for office and less than for industrial  depending on submarkets and product type

the company s vacancy rate at december  was approximately 
the company owns approximately million square feet in the dallas metroplex market 
the vacancy rate in las colinas  where most of the company s properties are located  has stabilized at levels nearing for office and for industrial flex

the company believes that any such new construction could cause vacancy rates to rise and limit opportunities to increase rental rates 
the company s vacancy rate at december  was approximately 
the company owns approximately million square feet in the austin and greater houston markets 
the austin market has been adversely affected by downturns in the technology industry 
softness in this market has increased competition for tenants  resulting in a reduction in rental rates and increased rent concessions  tenant improvement allowances and lease commissions 
the company s vacancy rate at december  was approximately which was roughly equivalent to market averages 
in december   the company acquired a million square foot property located in the airport west submarket of miami dade county in florida

growth of the company s operations and acquisitions and dispositions of properties during and  the company focused on maximizing cash flow from its existing core portfolio of properties and through acquisitions and dispositions of properties  expanding its presence in existing and new markets through strategic acquisitions and strengthening its balance sheet  primarily through the issuance of preferred equity 
the company has historically maintained low debt and overall leverage levels through the issuance of preferred equity  this approach is intended to provide the company with the flexibility for future growth without the need to issue additional common stock 
during the year ended december   the company acquired a  square foot office complex in fairfax  virginia  for million 
during  the company added approximately million square feet to its portfolio at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
the company acquired  square feet in southern california for million   square feet in northern texas for million  million square feet in florida for million  and  square feet in phoenix  arizona for million 
during  the company did not complete any acquisitions 
the company plans to continue to seek to build its presence in existing markets by acquiring high quality facilities in selected markets 
the company targets properties with below market rents which may offer it growth in rental rates above market averages  and which offer the company the ability to achieve economies of scale resulting in more efficient operations 
in  the company sold a flex facility in austin  texas  for gross proceeds of approximately million  a  square foot building in beaverton  oregon for gross proceeds of million  a  and  square foot unit at micc  with gross proceeds of million and two flex parks totaling approximately  square feet in maryland for gross proceeds of approximately million

impact of inflation although inflation has slowed in recent years  it is still a factor in our economy and the company continues to seek ways to mitigate its impact 
a substantial portion of the company s leases require tenants to pay operating expenses  including real estate taxes  utilities  and insurance  as well as increases in common area expenses  partially reducing the company s exposure to inflation

the white paper defines ffo as net income  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  before depreciation  amortization  minority interest in income  and extraordinary items 
management believes that ffo provides a useful measure of the company s operating performance and when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities  general and administrative expenses and interest costs  providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
ffo should be analyzed in conjunction with net income 
however  ffo should not be viewed as a substitute for net income as a measure of operating performance or liquidity as it does not reflect depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditure and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of the company s properties  which are significant economic costs and could materially impact the company s results from operations 
management believes ffo provides useful information to the investment community about the company s operating performance when compared to the performance of other real estate companies as ffo is generally recognized as the industry standard for reporting operations of real estate investment trusts reit 
other reits may use different methods for calculating ffo and  accordingly  our ffo may not be comparable to other real estate companies 
ffo for the company is computed as follows in thousands years ended december  net income allocable to common shareholders less gain on sale of marketable and other securities less gain on disposition of real estate less equity income from sale of joint venture properties depreciation and amortization depreciation from joint venture minority interest in income common units consolidated ffo allocable to common shareholders and minority interests ffo allocated to minority interests common units ffo allocated to common shareholders ffo allocated to common shareholders for the year ended december   was consistent with the same period in ffo for the year ended december  included non cash distributions of million related to the application of eitf topic d and the redemption of million of preferred equity completed in ffo for the same period of included a non cash impairment charge related to the previously anticipated sale of assets in beaverton  oregon
