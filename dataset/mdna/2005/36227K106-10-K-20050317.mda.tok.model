the company received million in cash  subject to certain adjustments 
the operating results of the company s process business have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
following the sale of process  the company operates only in the simulation business 
on september   the company amended the mantech preferred stock issuance agreement to revise the conversion rate from per share to per share 
the change in conversion rate increased the number of common shares available upon conversion from  to  on october  mantech elected to convert all of its preferred stock to common stock and sold all of its gse common stock and subordinated debt to gp strategies 
the terms of the  subordinated note were amended by the company to allow the conversion of the subordinated debt to gse common stock at a rate of which was below the market rate on the date the amendment was adopted

as a result of these transactions  gse became a owned subsidiary of gp strategies 
the company enters with no bank debt and only  of other notes payable 
however  the company s backlog has decreased in  and the company is investing heavily in business development activities to expand its simulation business into the homeland security and us military industries 
the company expects to improve its profitability in  and the company s cash flow is expected to be sufficient for its operating needs during although the company will utilize its line of credit during however  the company s liquidity can be affected by any of the following significant risk factors the company s business is substantially dependent on sales to the nuclear power industry of revenue in 
spending by companies in this targeted industry is subject to period to period fluctuations as a consequence of industry cycles  economic conditions  political and regulatory environments and other factors 
the company s efforts to expand its simulation business into the homeland security and us military industries may not generate sufficient revenues and margins in to offset the increased business development spending 
the company relies on one customer  battelle s pacific northwest national laboratory of revenue in for a substantial portion of its revenues 
the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect upon the company liquidity 
sales of products and the provision of services to end users outside the united states accounted for approximately of the company s revenue in thus  the company is subject to risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from trade or foreign policy 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in preparing the company s financial statements  management makes several estimates and assumptions that affect the company s reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
those accounting estimates that have the most significant impact on the company s operating results and place the most significant demands on management s judgment are discussed below 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates may require adjustment 
revenue recognition on long term contracts 
the company uses the percentage of completion revenue recognition methodology to record revenue under its long term fixed price contracts in accordance with the aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
this methodology recognizes income as work progresses on the contract and is based on an estimate of the income earned to date  less income recognized in earlier periods 
the company bases its estimate of the degree of completion of the contract by reviewing the relationship of costs incurred to date to the expected total costs that will be incurred on the project 
the company s project managers are responsible for estimating the costs to be incurred at the beginning of each project and are responsible for updating the estimate as the project progresses 
management reviews the status of each project periodically with the project managers and determines whether the cost estimates are reasonable 
if changes in the estimated costs to complete the projects are required  the cumulative impact on the percentage of completion revenue calculation is recognized in the period identified 
whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract will exceed its total contract value  the company s operating results are charged for the full amount of the estimated losses immediately 
uncertainties inherent in the performance of contracts include labor availability and productivity  material costs  change order scope and pricing  software modification and customer acceptance issues 
the reliability of these cost estimates is critical to the company s revenue recognition as a significant change in the estimates can cause the company s revenue and related margins to change significantly from the amounts estimated in the early stages of the project 
capitalization of computer software development costs 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  the company capitalizes computer software development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established  but prior to the release of the software product for sale to customers 
once the product is available to be sold  the company begins to amortize the costs over the estimated useful life of the product  which normally ranges from three to five years 
at december   the company has net capitalized software development costs of  on an annual basis  the company assesses the recovery of the unamortized software computer costs by estimating the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the sale of the product 
if the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the unamortized software costs the company will write down the investment to its estimated fair value based on future discounted cash flows 
the excess of any unamortized computer software costs over the related net realizable value is written down and charged to income 
significant changes in the sales projections could result in an impairment with respect to the capitalized software that is reported on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
deferred income tax valuation allowance 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
as required by sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  management makes a periodic assessment of the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets 
in making this assessment  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income of the company in making this assessment 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the total deferred income tax assets to its net realizable value 
at december   the company s deferred tax assets related primarily to a us net operating loss carryforward of million which expires in various amounts over the next twenty years 
the amount of loss carryforward which can be used by the company may be limited to approximately  annually 
other than the net deferred tax assets that are related to the company s swedish subsidiary  the recovery of the net deferred tax asset could not be substantiated by currently available objective evidence 
accordingly  the company has established an million valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are not related to the swedish subsidiary 
the valuation allowance will be reduced if the company s us operations are able to realize taxable income in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is principally confined to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
during the year ended december   and of the company s revenue was from contracts which permitted payments in a currency other than us dollars  principally swedish krona and japanese yen  respectively 
for the year ended december   and of the company s revenue was denominated in swedish krona and japanese yen  respectively 
for the year ended december   of the company s revenue was in swedish krona  was in japanese yen 
in addition  during the years ended december   and   and  respectively  of the company s expenses were incurred in swedish krona 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from inter company accounts in which costs incurred in one entity are charged to other entities in different foreign jurisdictions 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of all foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  those results when translated may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the company utilizes various derivative financial instruments to manage market risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
it is the company s policy to use derivative financial instruments to protect against market risk arising in the normal course of business 
the criteria the company uses for designating an instrument as a hedge include the instrument s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
the company monitors its foreign currency exposures to maximize the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
principal currencies hedged include the euro and the japanese yen 
the company s objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize the risks using the most effective methods to reduce the impact of these exposures 
the company minimizes credit exposure by limiting counterparties to nationally recognized financial institutions 
at december   the company had contracts for the sale of approximately million japanese yen at fixed rates 
the contracts expire on various dates through may  the company has not designated the contracts as hedges and  accordingly  has recorded the estimated fair value of the contracts of  at december  as an other asset in the consolidated balance sheet and other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company is also subject to market risk related to the interest rates on its existing line of credit 
as of march   such interest rates are based on the prime rate plus basis points 
as of december  and throughout the full year ending december   the company did not have any outstanding debt that was subject to variable interest rates
