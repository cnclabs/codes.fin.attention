item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview beckman coulter simplifies and automates laboratory processes used in all phases of the battle against disease 
we design  manufacture and market systems that consist of instruments  chemistries  software and supplies that meet a variety of biomedical laboratory needs 
our products are used in a range of applications  from lab solutions used for pioneering medical research  clinical research and drug discovery to diagnostic systems found in hospitals and physicians offices to aid in patient care 
we compete in market segments that we estimate totaled approximately billion in annual sales worldwide in we currently have products that address approximately half of that market 
our products compete in the clinical diagnostics and biomedical research markets 
clinical diagnostics and biomedical research generated approximately and of revenues  respectively 
our product lines include virtually all blood tests routinely performed in hospital laboratories and a range of systems for medical and pharmaceutical research 
we have more than  systems operating in laboratories around the world 
our clinical diagnostic instruments are typically leased to customers under either operating type lease otl or sales type lease stl arrangements while our biomedical research products are typically cash sales 
approximately of our revenues came from after market customer purchases of operating supplies  chemistry kits and service 
we market our products in more than countries  with approximately of revenues in coming from sales outside the united states 
our strategy is to expand our market share as a leading provider of laboratory systems by the continued rollout of new products  enhancements of our current product offerings  and entries into new and growing market segments 
the clinical diagnostics market has recently experienced modest growth as diagnostic test volumes continue to increase as a result of factors such as an aging population  increasing expenditures on diseases requiring costly treatment for example  diabetes  aids and cancer  and greater acceptance of western medicine in emerging countries 
in clinical diagnostics  our customers are faced with increasing volumes of testing and a shrinking skilled labor pool while under constant pressure to contain costs 
consequently  it has become essential for manufacturers to provide cost effective diagnostic systems to remain competitive 
our unicel dxi access immunoassay systems and the power processor front end automation system provide our customers with a means to increase efficiency through automation and workstation consolidation 
we believe these industry leading  high throughput platforms have positioned us to gain market share in the coming years 
to further the potential of these systems we are developing new assays internally  collaborating with external parties and pursuing business and technology acquisitions 
over the past two years  we have introduced twelve new assays for use on the unicel and access systems  including tests for pancreatic and breast cancer 
in  we signed four assay development agreements one of which resulted in the introduction of a test for bnp b type natriuretic peptide  which is an indicator of congestive heart failure 
in  we signed a licensing agreement for inos inducible nitric oxide a new marker in blood that we plan to develop into a test to be used in the detection and management of patients at risk for developing sepsis  a potentially deadly medical condition 
in hematology  we continue to automate more of the testing process with recently introduced platforms to serve high volume hospital labs and small to mid sized labs 
the biomedical research market is dependent on academic research funding and capital spending in the biotechnology  pharmaceutical and clinical research markets 
these biomedical research markets have struggled in recent years 
however  spending on academic and government funded research is growing at a modest rate  differing country by country 
in the us  national institute of health funding is expected to be up about for we are seeing an increase in pharmaceutical and biotechnology research and development investment along with a growing need to simplify and automate testing in the clinical research market 
these trends are driving growth in certain areas of the biomedical research market 
in biomedical research our strategy is focused on becoming a provider of solutions for our various customers 
to serve customers researching proteins and their roles in the health of the human body  we have a number of products useful in many phases of proteomic research including our proteomelab pf d fractionation system  which simplifies and automates this type of research  and the proteomelab a tm microarray system  a medium density testing array platform for therapeutic development and evaluation of biomarkers for disease diagnosis 
we are also entering growing segments within the robotic automation market such as forensics  biological agent testing and molecular pathology 
our cytomics fc series of flow cytometers  which provide powerful cell analysis technology for disease and drug research  continue to be well accepted in the marketplace 
our after market sales of chemistry kits  supplies and service allow us to generate substantial operating cash flow 
we continue to use this cash flow to facilitate growth in the business by developing  marketing and launching new products through internal development and business and technology acquisitions 
additionally  during  we have used our operating cash flow to repurchase shares of our common stock and pay regular quarterly dividends 
we plan to increase our quarterly dividend to a payout ratio over time 
in and  we also made million and million  respectively  in contributions to our us pension plan 
in order to continue to grow the company  gain market share and remain competitive  we must continue to introduce new instrument and reagent technologies  acquire and defend intellectual property and invest in research and development 
otherwise  our current products could become technologically obsolete over time 
we believe that our strong cash flow will enable us to continue to fund these activities 
additionally  we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could hamper our efforts to successfully increase market share and expand into new markets such as economic weakness  pressure on healthcare spending  constrained government research funding and our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for new products 
we believe we are addressing these risks by providing our customers automated and cost effective solutions 
a large number of our products require marketing authorizations from the us food drug administration fda and similar agencies in other countries 
we have effective quality and compliance programs in place and have been successful in obtaining the necessary clearances for our new products from the fda and other similar agencies

constant currency growth as presented herein represents current period constant currency sales see below less prior year reported sales prior year reported sales we define constant currency sales as current period sales in local currency translated to us dollars at the prior year s average foreign currency exchange rate 
this measure provides information on sales growth assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior year and the current period 
constant currency sales and constant currency growth as defined or presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
additionally  constant currency sales is not an alternative measure of revenues on a us gaap basis 
the sales growth during was primarily due to increases in sales of clinical diagnostic systems and related reagents aided by our new product flows 
the strengthening of foreign currencies  primarily the euro and yen  versus the us dollar  also contributed to the company s reported growth rates  adding for the year 
growth in clinical diagnostics of in was driven by strength in routine chemistry and immunodiagnostics 
routine chemistry sales grew primarily as a result of sales of the synchron lx i combined routine chemistry and immunoassay system and sales of laboratory automation systems as our customers continue to focus on efficiency and cost savings 
immunodiagnostics sales grew for the year as a result of placements of the unicel dxi access immunoassay system 
this product has allowed the company to enter into the large hospital and reference lab markets 
reagent sales in immunodiagnostics have also contributed to the significant growth in this product line 
over the past two years  the company has introduced twelve new assays for use on its immunoassay systems  including tests for pancreatic and breast cancer 
hematology sales growth was for the year and resulted primarily from sales of the coulter lh mid range and coulter lh high throughput hematology systems as these products continue to enjoy market acceptance 
biomedical research sales grew in as the biomedical research and biotechnology markets continued a modest recovery 
growth in biomedical research was primarily a result of strong sales of specialty testing and proteomic products 
specialty testing grew in  as a result of increased sales of the cytomics fc series of flow cytometers and related reagents 
also contributing to the growth in biomedical research sales were the allegra x series of bench top centrifuges and the proteomelab pf d and pa systems within the centrifuge analytical systems product area 
partially offsetting these increases for the year was the sale of the laboratory automation operations lao product line that took place in the second quarter of this product line generated million of revenues in that did not recur in sales in europe  in constant currency  increased led by sales of immunodiagnostics and specialty testing product lines throughout the region 
sales in germany continue to depress overall sales growth in europe as this country continues to restructure its healthcare reimbursement policies 
sales in asia  in constant currency  increased as a result of increased sales in clinical chemistry and immunodiagnostics product lines 
sales in japan  in constant currency  though down in the early part of and for the full year  actually grew in the fourth quarter of china and south east asia sales growth was particularly strong as our products continue to be well received 
operating expenses gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin was and for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin was due to the following higher service costs to support new product introductions  which unfavorably impacted gross margin by percentage points  increased operating costs  primarily freight  which unfavorably impacted gross margin by percentage points  partially offset by foreign currency exchange rates  which favorably impacted the gross margin by percentage points 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million to million or of sales in from million or of sales in the prior year 
the dollar increase in sg a spending was a result of increased sales volume  a weaker us dollar  the increased investments in selling and marketing activities related to our immunoassay and other new product offerings and sales related incentive compensation partially offset by a decrease in certain other employee bonus plans relative to those of due to the company not meeting certain internal objectives 
these employee bonus plans which are recorded in cost of goods sold  sg a and research and development  depending on the function of the eligible employee  decreased to million in from million in research and development r d expenses increased million to million in from million in r d as a percentage of sales was and in and  respectively 
changes in r d as a percentage of sales are due primarily to the timing of certain projects and the impact of a weaker us dollar on revenue 
also contributing to a decrease in r d as a percentage of sales were decreased employee bonus plans relative to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies did not impact r d expense  as substantially all r d efforts are in the us  resulting in a decrease in r d as a percentage of sales 
in the first quarter of  the company recorded a restructure charge of million which represented the anticipated total cost associated with a reorganization to form the biomedical research division  a refocus of international operations and a workforce reduction of nearly positions worldwide 
certain related employee termination costs were paid through the third quarter of for the year ended december   approximately million of restructuring charges were reversed as it was determined that these amounts were not going to be utilized 
see note provision for restructuring operations of the consolidated financial statements for more information 
as indicated in note business segment information of the consolidated financial statements all corporate activities are captured in a central service center  including costs incurred at the corporate level which significantly benefit the operations of each segment 
because these segment related costs remain in the center  a discussion of our operating profit by segment is not meaningful 
non operating income and expenses interest income includes income from stl receivables 
interest income increased million to million in from million in  due primarily to retention of more stl receivables during as compared to stl receivables  which generate interest income over the life of the lease  are occasionally sold to a third party 
see note sale of assets of the consolidated financial statements for more information 
interest expense declined million to million in from million in due primarily to the successful resolution of certain segments of the internal revenue service audit of the tax years ending in through  which resulted in the elimination of approximately million of related interest accruals during also contributing to reduced interest expense in were lower average debt balances 
other non operating income and expense includes the following in millions foreign exchange and related derivative activity investment write downs gain on sales of stl receivables gain on sale of the assets of lao other total the million investment write down in was the result of impairments on the value of investments in both marketable and non marketable equity securities that were determined to be other than temporary in nature 
the increase in foreign currency related activity costs is due primarily to increased hedging expense resulting from the strengthening of foreign currencies against the us dollar 
see note derivatives of the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the assets of lao were sold in the second quarter of and resulted in a million gain

this measure provides information on sales growth assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior year and the current period 
constant currency sales and constant currency growth as defined or presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
additionally  constant currency sales is not an alternative measure of revenues on a us gaap basis 
sales growth during was driven primarily by sales in the clinical diagnostics division aided by a strengthening of foreign currencies versus the us dollar 
routine chemistry sales grew and immunodiagnostics sales grew in double digits  bolstered in part by placements of the new synchron lx i combination routine chemistry and immunoassay system and unicel dxi access immunoassay system 
hematology product sales were up due to a renewed contract with a large commercial laboratory network in the us and product placements in asia due to the sars epidemic in this region 
in the biomedical research division  the specialty testing product area continued to grow  up more than 
these increases were led by sales of the cytomics fc series flow cytometer  partially offset by continued softness in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology capital equipment markets and the sale of the assets of the laboratory automation operations lao product line in the second quarter internationally  sales in asia were higher due primarily to stronger sales of clinical diagnostic products 
a decline in biomedical research sales in europe  excluding the benefits of currency  was due primarily to decreased spending in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology capital equipment markets and the discontinuation of a product line in operating expenses gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin in was  percentage points higher than in on a constant currency basis  gross margin was  percentage points higher than the prior year 
the increase in margin is mainly due to the following foreign currency exchange rates that favorably impacted the gross margin rate by percentage point  a favorable product mix in both diagnostics and biomedical research  whereby more of our higher margin generating products were sold during the year 
this resulted in about a percentage point favorable impact  more effective inventory management improved gross margin by about percentage points  and manufacturing efficiencies supported by rising volumes resulted in a percentage point favorable impact 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million to million or of sales in from million or of sales in the prior year due primarily to the strengthening of foreign currencies versus the us dollar  investments in marketing activities for new products  and increased accruals under certain employee performance based compensation plans 
research and development r d expenses increased million to million in from million in r d as a percentage of sales was consistent from year to year at and in and  respectively 
the dollar increase was due primarily to increased accruals under employee performance based compensation plans  the development of new tests for the company s immunodiagnostic systems and instrument development in the hematology and routine chemistry product lines 
in the first quarter of  the company recorded a restructure charge of million which represents the anticipated total cost associated with a reorganization to form the biomedical research division  a refocus of international operations and a workforce reduction of nearly positions worldwide 
see note provision for restructuring operations of the consolidated financial statements for more information 
during the first quarter of  the company settled its claims against an escrow account created as part of the beckman instruments  inc acquisition of coulter corporation to cover contingent pre acquisition liabilities 
the company recorded a non taxable credit of million and related pretax expenses of million million after taxes  resulting in a net credit of million after taxes 
in november  the company reached a settlement agreement with flextronics international  ltd 
flextronics in the amount of million 
this taxable settlement resolved the company s claim for compensatory and punitive damages  included reimbursement for legal and other related expenses and was recorded in operating income 
the lawsuit was originally filed against flextronics and its us subsidiary flextronics usa  inc  formerly known as dovatron  in the second quarter of seeking damages for breach of contract and other claims 
non operating income and expenses interest income includes income from stl receivables 
interest income increased million to million in from million in  due primarily to an increased number of stl agreements entered into in interest expense declined million to million in compared to million in primarily due to lower average debt balances and lower interest rates on the variable portion of our borrowings 
other non operating income expense was million in and primarily consisted of foreign currency related activities of  a million investment write down that was the result of impairments on the value of investments in both marketable and non marketable equity securities that were determined to be other than temporary in nature  partially offset by a gain on the sale of certain stl receivables of million and a gain of million on the sale of the assets of the lao product line 
other non operating income expense was million in and primarily consisted of foreign currency related activities of million  a write down of million resulting from a reduction in the fair value of a biotechnology equity investment and gains on the sales of stl receivables of million 
the increase in foreign currency related activity costs is due primarily to increased hedging expense resulting from the strengthening of foreign currencies against the us dollar 
see note derivatives of the consolidated financial statements for more information 
income taxes income tax as a percentage of pretax income was  and for the years  and  respectively 
income taxes as a percentage of pretax income in and was impacted by several items as follows the incremental tax liability resulting from the repatriation of million of formerly indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings in under the homeland investment provisions of the american jobs creation act  the successful resolution in of certain segments of an internal revenue service audit of the tax years ending in through  a million non taxable credit received in in settlement of the coulter escrow account dispute  the million restructure charge recorded in  the million litigation settlement received from flextronics in  and the million litigation charge taken in see note commitments and contingencies of the consolidated financial statements for more information on the litigation settlements 
see note income taxes of the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the us statutory tax rate to the company s effective tax rate 
we expect the effective tax rate in to be higher than that of with potential quarterly fluctuations 
our effective tax rate will be impacted by a number of factors including  but not limited to  enactments of new tax laws  new interpretations of existing tax laws  rulings by and settlements with taxing authorities  our utilization of tax credits and our geographic profit mix 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing and to convert those assets into cash that are no longer required in meeting existing strategic objectives 
therefore  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current and potentially available funds for use in achieving long range business objectives and meeting our commitments 
our business model  in particular sales from after market kits  supplies and service  allows us to generate substantial operating cash flows 
we anticipate our operating cash flows will continue to satisfy our working capital requirements without the need for additional indebtedness 
additionally  we currently do not have plans to significantly reduce our long term debt levels in the next twelve months due to the long term maturities of our senior notes 
this flexibility allows us to invest in areas that will help meet our strategic objectives 
during the next twelve months  we anticipate using our operating cash flows to facilitate growth in the business by developing  marketing and launching new products 
new product offerings will come from existing r d projects  business acquisitions and by gaining access to new technologies through license arrangements 
to repurchase shares of our company stock and reduce the number of common shares outstanding 
in january  our company s board of directors approved a plan authorizing the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock through in  we completed the repurchase of the million shares million repurchased during that were previously authorized by our board of directors in to raise and maintain our quarterly dividend to our historical annual payout ratio over time 
our dividend paid in the fourth quarter was per share 
in january  the company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable on march  to stockholders of record on february  this dividend in the first quarter of represents the rd consecutive quarterly payout in the company s history 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash flows provided by operating activities increased by million between and primarily due to decreases in contributions to the us pension plans  from million in to million in  an increase in income tax liabilities in due primarily to increased taxable income and the timing of payments in our non us subsidiaries  partially offset by an increase in current and long term receivables associated with revenue growth and the retention of more stl receivables  decreased inventory turns from times in to times in due to a larger increase in ending inventory balances relative to the increase in cost of sales from to the introduction of various new products and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates contributed to this increase in ending inventory balances  and a decrease in cash flows related to the impact of items in that did not recur in  such as the restructure  the coulter escrow account and flextronics litigation settlements  which provided a combined million net positive cash flow in cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by million between and primarily due to increases in contributions to the us pension plans  from million in to million in  an increase in long term receivables associated with the retention of stl receivables  decreased inventory turns from times in to times in due to a larger increase in ending inventory balances relative to the increase in cost of sales from to the introduction of various new products contributed to the increase in ending inventory at december   partially offset by an increase in cash flows related to the impact of items in  such as the restructure  the coulter escrow account and flextronics litigation settlements  which provided a combined million net positive cash flow in  and increased accounts payable and accrued liabilities due primarily to increases in the accruals for incentive compensation plans  payroll and related taxes 
investing activities used cash of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures increased by million from million in to million in due primarily to an increase in fixed assets for operating type leases and our continued implementation of our global erp system 
we are in the process of implementing an erp system in order to achieve a single  globally integrated infrastructure 
this includes functionality for finance  human resources  supply chain  order management  finished goods inventory management and sales and service to replace or complement existing legacy systems and business processes 
since the inception of the program in through december   we have capitalized million of costs associated with this erp system which includes million of capitalized internal labor costs 
based on geographic rollout strategy  as of december   we have essentially implemented functionality for finance  human resources and certain purchasing systems for our global operations 
sales functionality has been implemented on a limited integration basis for our us and canadian operations 
systems for finished goods inventory and physical distribution have been implemented for europe  including the deployment of systems for sales  service and order management in most entities in europe 
in  we revised the originally scheduled deployment dates of certain systems and we expect that the majority of the work required to complete this phase of the global implementation of the new systems will take place through the end of external costs are expected to approximate those originally anticipated while internal costs  consisting primarily of internal labor and benefits  are expected to increase as a result of the revised schedule 
if we are unable to implement and effectively manage the transition to these new systems  our future consolidated operating results could be adversely affected 
based upon current levels of operations and expected future growth  we believe our cash flows from operations together with available borrowings under our credit facility see note debt financing of the consolidated financial statements and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our anticipated requirements for interest payments and other debt service obligations  working capital  capital expenditures  lease payments  pension contributions and other operating needs 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that estimated cost savings or growth can be achieved 
future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance existing indebtedness  will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the company maintains a million credit facility  which is unsecured  enables us to borrow up to million and can be increased up to million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions  matures in july and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments 
borrowings under the million credit facility generally bear interest at libor plus a margin to based upon our senior unsecured debt rating 
we must also pay a quarterly facility fee of per annum on the million credit facility commitment 
no amounts were drawn on the million credit facility at december  and in january  the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that will terminate in january the new agreement provides the company with a million revolving line of credit  which may be increased in million increments up to a maximum line of credit of million 
interest on advances is determined using formulas specified in the agreement  generally  an approximation of libor plus a to margin 
the company also must pay a facility fee of per annum on the aggregate average daily amount of each lender s commitment 
the following is included in long term debt at december  and dollar amounts in millions average rate of interest senior notes  unsecured  due senior notes  unsecured  due debentures  unsecured  due other long term debt in october  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission 
this registration  which became effective in early gives us the ability to offer and sell up to million of securities  which may include debt securities  preferred stock  common stock and warrants to purchase debt securities  common stock  preferred stock or depository shares 
the issuance of any such securities could represent new financing or could be used to pay down existing debt 
we have no immediate plans to offer or sell any securities 
the following represents a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments in millions payments due by period total thereafter long term debt and interest a b operating leases other c total contractual cash obligations  a the amounts for long term debt assume that the respective debt instruments will be outstanding until their scheduled maturity dates

critical accounting policies the us securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding in their calls on judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
we are not aware of any reasonably possible events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being reported that would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  including customer leased equipment for products  revenue is recognized when risk of loss transfers  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured  except when a customer enters into an otl agreement  in which case revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
under a stl agreement  revenue is generally recognized at the time of shipment based on the present value of the minimum lease payments with interest income recognized over the life of the lease using the interest method 
service revenues on maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the life of the service agreement or as service is performed  if not under contract 
for those equipment sales that include multiple deliverables  such as installation  training  after market supplies or service  we allocate revenue based on the relative fair values of the individual components as determined in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
credit is extended based upon the evaluation of the customer s financial condition and we generally do not require collateral 
determination of appropriate revenue recognition for leases our accounting for leases involves specific determinations under sfas no 
accounting for leases which often involve complex provisions and significant judgments 
the four criteria of sfas no 
that we use in the determination of a sales type lease stl or operating type lease otl are a review of the lease term to determine if it is equal to or greater than percent of the economic life of the equipment  a review of the minimum lease payments to determine if they are equal to or greater than percent of the fair market value of the equipment  a determination of whether or not the lease transfers ownership to the lessee at the end of the lease term  and a determination of whether or not the lease contains a bargain purchase option 
additionally  before classifying a lease as an stl  we assess whether collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured and whether there are any significant uncertainties related to costs that we have yet to incur with respect to the lease 
generally our leases that qualify as stls are non cancelable leases with a term of percent or more of the economic life of the equipment 
certain of our lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria 
the economic life of our leased equipment and its fair value require significant accounting estimates and judgment 
these estimates are based on our historical experience 
the most objective measure of the economic life of our leased equipment is the original term of a lease  which is typically five years  since a majority of the equipment is returned by the lessee at or near the end of the lease term and there is not a significant after market for our used equipment without substantial remanufacturing 
we believe that this is representative of the period during which the equipment is expected to be economically usable  with normal service  for the purpose for which it is intended 
we regularly evaluate the economic life of existing and new products for purposes of this determination 
the fair market value of our leased equipment is determined by a range of cash selling prices or other verifiable objective evidence  if applicable 
we regularly evaluate available objective evidence of equipment fair values using historical data 
we have certain government contracts with cancellation clauses or renewal provisions that are generally required by law  such as those dependant on fiscal funding outside of a governmental unit s control  those that can be cancelled if deemed in the tax payers best interest or those that must be renewed each fiscal year  given limitations that may exist on multi year contracts that are imposed by statue 
under these circumstances and in accordance with the relevant accounting literature  as well as considering our historical experience  a thorough evaluation of these contracts is performed to assess whether cancellation is remote or whether exercise of the renewal option is reasonably assured 
reserves for doubtful accounts we maintain reserves for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these reserves are determined by analyzing specific customer accounts that have known or potential collection issues and applying historical loss rates to the aging of the remaining accounts receivable balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance may be required 
inventory adjustments for write down of inventories to fair value inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method of determining inventory cost 
inventory schedules are regularly analyzed by finance and logistics personnel  and where necessary  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
a significant increase in the forecasted demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in forecasted demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand requiring additional inventory write downs 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on the expected number of years the asset will generate revenue 
this estimate of useful lives is reviewed periodically by management 
we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets which requires that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  impairment is tested by comparing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value and assessing the ongoing appropriateness of the indefinite life classification 
for goodwill  a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill 
we perform our annual impairment test on goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
at december   we had million of goodwill 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units we used a comparable industry revenue multiple approach for each of our two reportable units 
under this approach  we determined the average number of years of sales for certain companies in the appropriate reporting unit s industry that are required to equal that company s enterprise value  comparable industry revenue multiple 
we then took the product of the revenues for each reporting unit and the comparable industry revenue multiple  which represented that reporting unit s fair value 
in all cases  the fair value of the reporting unit was in excess of the reporting unit s book value  which resulted in no goodwill impairment 
accordingly  step two of the goodwill impairment test was not required to be performed 
we perform our annual impairment test on other intangible assets that have indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
at december   the million net book value of our coulter trade name and core technology was less than its estimated value as determined by an external valuation specialist using a relief from royalty income approach 
accordingly  these assets are not impaired 
numerous assumptions are developed in conjunction with our testing of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives such as the determination of appropriate revenue multiples and royalty rates  the selection of appropriate discount rates to determine the present value of future cash flows and long term revenue projections 
an increase or decrease in any of these assumptions or a change in plans related to the utilization of the coulter trade name and the core technology or a significant downturn in our business may result in a material impairment charge required to write down the book value of these assets 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
environmental obligations we establish provisions for exposure related to environmental and legal matters 
our compliance with federal  state and foreign environmental laws and regulations may require us to remove or mitigate the effects of the disposal or release of chemical substances in jurisdictions where we do business or maintain properties 
we establish reserves when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
provision amounts are estimated based on currently available information  regulatory requirements  remediation strategies  our relative share of the total remediation costs and a relevant discount rate 
changes in these assumptions could impact our future reported results 
legal obligations we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which we consider to be normal for our type of business operations 
as a global company active in a wide range of life sciences and chemical activities  we may  in the normal course of our business become involved in proceedings relating to matters such as patent validity and infringement disputes related to intellectual property  contractual obligations  and employment matters 
we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any proceedings in which we are or may become involved 
an adverse decision in a lawsuit seeking damages from us could result in a monetary award to the plaintiff and  to the extent not covered by our insurance policies or third party indemnities  could significantly harm the results of our operations 
an adverse decision in a lawsuit seeking an injunction or other similar relief could significantly harm our business operations 
if we lose a case in which we seek to enforce our patent rights  we could sustain a loss of future revenue as other manufacturers begin to market products we developed 
litigation cases and claims raise difficult and complex legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities  including  but not limited to  the facts and circumstances of each particular case and claim  the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought  and differences in applicable law 
upon resolution of any pending legal matters  we may incur charges in excess of presently established provisions and related insurance or third party coverage 
it is possible that our results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable outcome of certain pending litigation 
although we believe that our provisions are appropriate  and in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  changes in events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  profitability or liquidity 
income taxes we record liabilities for probable income tax assessments based on our estimate of potential tax related exposures 
recording of these assessments requires significant judgment as uncertainties often exist in respect to new laws  new interpretations of existing laws and rulings by taxing authorities 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount whose realization is more likely than not 
an increase to income would occur if we were to determine that we were able to utilize more of these deferred tax assets than currently expected 
pension plans our funding policy provides that payments to our domestic pension trusts shall at least be equal to the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption as to the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
our review of this long term return assumption is done in conjunction with our pension plan investment advisors and our actuaries 
we also review historical cumulative returns on plan assets 
the rate of return is dependent upon an investment strategy and the asset allocation of plan assets 
we then review the selected prospective return rate against benchmark information that we gather on other pension plans adjusting for relative size  investment strategies and funding levels 
since this is a long term return assumption  it is likely to change only when there are protracted changes in equity  bond and real estate markets 
while there is no absolute predictor of future performance  our historical return on plan assets has been over and we believe this historical performance is a fair approximation of what our plan assets can achieve over a variety of market conditions 
see note retirement benefits of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we believe our rate of return assumption is reasonable based on our long term investment strategy and allocation of our plan assets  which at december  had an allocation as follows equities  corporate bonds  real estate and other 
the discount rate is an assumption used to determine the actuarial present value of benefits attributed the services rendered participants in our pension plans 
the rate used reflects our best estimate of the rate at which pension benefits will be effectively settled 
we estimate this rate based on available rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available  primarily moody s aa corporate bond yields 
changes in the rate of return or discount rate could have a material effect on our reported pension obligation and related pension expense 
the following table outlines the approximate impact that a increase or decrease in the rate of return or discount rate would have on our us pension expense and projected benefit obligation in millions pension cost projected benefit obligation increase decrease in expected rate of return n a increase decrease in discount rate we use a combination of historical results and anticipated future events to estimate and make assumptions relating to our critical accounting policies 
actual results could differ from our estimates

although we believe we have the product offerings and resources required to achieve our objectives  actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements 
there can be no assurance that events anticipated by these forward looking statements will in fact transpire as expected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the u 
s 
securities and exchange commission requires that registrants include information about potential effects of changes in currency exchange and interest rates in their form k filings 
several alternatives  all with some limitations  have been offered 
the following discussion is based on a sensitivity analysis  which models the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
this analysis is constrained by several factors  including the following it is based on a single point in time  and it does not include the effects of other complex market reactions that would arise from the changes modeled 
although the results of the analysis may be useful as a benchmark  they should not be viewed as forecasts 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling and canadian dollar 
as of december  and  the notional amounts of all derivative foreign exchange contracts was million and million  respectively 
notional amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents at spot exchange rates at the respective dates 
the net fair value of all derivative foreign exchange contracts as of december  and  was a net liability of million and million  respectively 
we estimated the sensitivity of the fair value of all derivative foreign exchange contracts to a hypothetical strengthening and weakening of the spot exchange rates for the us dollar against the foreign currencies at december  the analysis showed that a strengthening of the us dollar would result in a gain from a fair value change of million and a weakening of the us dollar would result in a loss from a fair value change of million in these instruments 
losses and gains on the underlying transactions being hedged would largely offset any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis 
similarly  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our variable rate debt instruments and derivatives 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates was estimated to decrease or increase the company s pre tax earnings by million based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at december  this analysis includes the effect of our reverse interest rate swap derivatives which change the character of the interest rate on our long term debt by effectively converting a fixed rate to a variable rate 
additional information with respect to our foreign currency and interest rate exposures are discussed in note derivatives of the consolidated financial statements 
financial risk management our risk management program  developed by senior management and approved by the board of directors  seeks to minimize the potentially negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates on the results of operations 
our primary exposures to fluctuations in the financial markets are to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign exchange risk arises because our reporting currency is the us dollar and we generate approximately of our revenues in various foreign currencies 
us dollar denominated costs and expenses as a percentage of total operating costs and expenses are much greater than us dollar denominated sales as a percentage of total net sales 
as a result  appreciation of the us dollar against our major trading currencies has a negative impact on our results of operations  and depreciation of the us dollar against such currencies has a positive impact 
we seek to minimize our exposure to changes in exchange rates by denominating costs and expenses in foreign currencies 
when these opportunities are exhausted  we use derivative financial instruments to function as hedges 
we use forward contracts  purchased option contracts and complex option contracts consisting of purchased and sold options  to hedge certain foreign currency denominated transactions 
we do not use these instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our exposure to interest rate risk arises out of our long term debt obligations 
under the guidance of our risk management policies  we use derivative contracts on certain borrowing transactions 
with the aid of these contracts  we seek to reduce the negative effects of changes in interest rates by changing the character of the interest rate on our long term debt  converting a fixed rate to a variable rate and vice versa 
inflation we continually monitor inflation and the effects of changing prices 
inflation increases the cost of goods and services used 
competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets restrict our ability to fully recover the higher costs of acquired goods and services through price increases 
we attempt to mitigate the impact of inflation by implementing continuous process improvement solutions to enhance productivity and efficiency and  as a result  lower costs and operating expenses 
the effects of inflation have  in our opinion  been managed appropriately and as a result have not had a material impact on our operations and the resulting financial position or liquidity
