other contingent matters the company is involved in various lawsuits and claims  including asbestos related litigation and environmental matters 
for further information  please see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies application and use of estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the company s reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates and those differences could be material 
judgments and assessments of uncertainties are required in applying the company s accounting policies in many areas 
for example  key assumptions are particularly important in estimating final contract costs for long term contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting and in developing the company s projected liabilities for pension and other postretirement benefits 
other areas in which significant uncertainties exist include  but are not limited to  projected costs to be incurred in connection with legal matters 
the company applied its critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all periods presented in its consolidated financial statements and the company s management has discussed these policies with the audit committee 
commitments and contingencies the company recognizes a liability for legal indemnification and defense costs when it believes it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the liabilities are developed based on currently available information 
the accruals are recorded at undiscounted amounts if the company cannot reliably determine the timing of the cash payments  and the amounts are classified as non current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company also has insurance that covers certain losses and records receivables to the extent that claims can be reasonably estimated and realization is deemed probable 
the receivables are recorded at undiscounted amounts to coincide with the related accruals  and the amounts are classified as non current receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenue recognition the company generally follows the percentage of completion method of accounting for its long term contracts 
sales and gross profit are principally recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
alternatively  certain contracts provide for the production of various units throughout the contract period  and sales and gross profit on these contracts are accounted for based on the units delivered 
amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items are included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
incentives or penalties  estimated warranty costs and awards applicable to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates  and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance 
when adjustments in contract value or estimated costs are determined  any changes from prior estimates are reflected in earnings in the current period 
anticipated losses on contracts or programs in progress are charged to earnings when identified 
although management believes that the profits are fairly stated and that adequate provisions for losses on certain of the fixed price contracts have been recorded in the financial statements  revisions to such estimates do occur and at times are material to the company s results of operations and financial position 
inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
inventoried costs associated with long term contracts include costs and earnings of incomplete contracts not yet billable to the customer 
these amounts represent the difference between the percentage of completion method of accounting for long term contracts used to record operating results by the company s defense segment and the amounts billable to the customer under the terms of the specific contracts 
estimates of final contract costs and earnings including earnings subject to future determination through negotiation or other procedures are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts 
income taxes the company files income tax returns and estimates income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which it operates 
the company is subject to tax audits in each of these jurisdictions  which could result in changes to the estimated taxes 
the amount of these changes would vary by jurisdiction and would be recorded when known 
management has considered future taxable income and on going tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets at december   and concluded that no allowance was required at that time 
the company has recorded liabilities for tax contingencies for open years 
the company does not expect the resolution of tax matters for these years to have a material impact on its results of operations  financial condition or cash flows

sfas no 
r requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
as of december   the company accounted for its stock based compensation plans under the intrinsic value method of accounting in accordance with apb no 
 which generally resulted in the recognition of no compensation cost 
in addition  the company furnished the pro forma disclosures of stock based compensation expense required under sfas no 
the company anticipates that it will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r for the interim period beginning july   using the modified version of the prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted after the effective date  and to all awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
in addition  compensation cost is recognized on or after the effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards previously calculated and reported in the pro forma disclosures under apb no 
the company does not anticipate adopting the modified retrospective application election allowed under sfas no 
r for periods before the effective date and  accordingly  will not adjust prior period financial statements presented for comparative purposes 
based on the number of unvested outstanding awards at december   the pre tax effect of adopting sfas no 
r is expected to increase compensation cost by approximately  for the six months ending december   and  and  for the years ending december  and additional compensation cost will be recognized as new options are awarded 
the company has not made any material modifications to its stock based compensation plans as the result of the issuance of sfas no 
r

 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share eitf 
eitf was ratified by the fasb on october   and became effective for reporting periods ending after december  eitf requires contingently convertible debt instruments with a market price trigger to be included in diluted earnings per share computations  if dilutive  regardless of whether the market price trigger or any other market price contingent conversion feature has been met  and requires prior period diluted earnings per share amounts presented for comparative purposes to be restated 
accordingly  the company s diluted earnings per share computation for the year ended december  includes  weighted average potential dilutive shares for the assumed conversion of its convertible senior notes  issued on september   into shares of the company s common stock 
the effect of adopting eitf on the company s diluted earnings per share computations for the three month and nine month periods ended september   the only prior period amounts that need to be restated  was to increase the previously reported number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding by  shares and  shares  respectively  resulting in restated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of and  respectively

risk factors important risk factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the company s forward looking statements contained herein include the company depends on government contracts for substantially all of its sales 
the company derived approximately of its consolidated net sales from the us government and its agencies during the year ended december  the company expects that sales to the us government will continue to be the primary source of its revenue for the foreseeable future 
therefore  any significant disruption or deterioration of the company s relationship with the us government would significantly reduce the company s revenues 
in addition  the funding of defense programs also competes with non defense spending of the us government 
the company s business is also highly sensitive to changes in national and international priorities and the us government budgets 
a shift in government defense spending to other programs in which the company is not involved or a reduction in us government defense spending generally could have severe consequences on the company s results of operations 
the company acts as prime contractor or major subcontractor for many different us government programs 
over its lifetime  a program may be implemented by the award of many different individual contracts and subcontracts 
the funding of us government programs is subject to congressional appropriations 
although multiple year contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements  congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years 
consequently  programs are often only partially funded initially  and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations 
the termination of funding for a us government program would result in a loss of anticipated future revenues attributable to that program 
that could have a negative impact on the company s operations 
in addition  the termination of a program or failure to commit funds to a prospective program or a program already started could increase the company s overall costs of doing business 
in addition  us government contracts typically contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government agencies rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts  including providing the government agency with the ability to unilaterally terminate or reduce the value of and modify some of the terms and conditions of existing contracts  suspend or permanently prohibit the company from doing business with the us government or with any specific governmental agency  control and potentially prohibit the export of the company s products  and claim rights in technologies and systems invented  developed or produced by the company 
if a us government agency terminates a contract with the company for convenience  the company generally may recover only its incurred or committed costs  settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination 
if an agency terminates a contract with the company for default  the company is denied any recovery and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the agency in procuring undelivered items from an alternative source 
the company may receive show cause or cure notices under contracts that  if not addressed to the agency s satisfaction  could give the agency the right to terminate those contracts for default or to cease procuring the company s services under those contracts 
in the event that any of the company s contracts were to be terminated or adversely modified  there may be significant adverse effects on its revenues  operating costs and income that would not be recoverable 
as a us government contractor  the company is subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations 
the company must comply with and is affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of us government contracts 
these laws and regulations  among other things  require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations  define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern the company s right to reimbursement under certain cost based us government contracts and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information and the exportation of certain products and technical data 
a violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of the company s contracts and  under certain circumstances  suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time 
these laws and regulations affect how the company does business with its customers and in some instances  impose added costs on its businesses 
these costs might increase in the future  reducing margins  which could have a negative effect on the company s financial condition 
the company s businesses could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the us government 
us government agencies  such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa  routinely audit and investigate government contractors 
these agencies review a contractor s performance under its contracts  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
the dcaa also reviews the adequacy of  and a contractor s compliance with  its internal control systems and policies  including the contractor s purchasing  property  estimating  compensation and information management systems 
any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed  while such costs already reimbursed must be refunded 
if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  the company may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government 
in addition  as a us government contractor  the company is subject to an increased risk of investigations  criminal prosecution  civil fraud  whistleblower lawsuits and other legal actions and liabilities to which purely private sector companies are not  the results of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company could suffer serious harm to its reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against it 
the company s revenues will be adversely affected if the company fails to receive renewal or follow on contracts 
renewal and follow on contracts are important because the company s contracts are for fixed terms 
these terms vary from shorter than one year to over five years  particularly for contracts with options 
the typical term of the company s contracts with the us government is between one and three years 
the loss of revenues from the company s possible failure to obtain renewal or follow on contracts may be significant because the company s us government contracts account for a substantial portion of its revenues 
cost over runs on the company s fixed price contracts could subject it to losses and adversely affect its future business 
during the year ended december   fixed price contract sales comprised of defense segment sales 
under firm fixed price contracts  the company performs services under a contract at a stipulated price 
if the company fails to anticipate technical problems  estimate costs accurately or control costs during its performance of fixed price contracts  the company can incur losses on those contracts because any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by the company 
under time and materials contracts  the company is paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses 
under cost reimbursement contracts  which are subject to a contract ceiling amount  the company is reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee  which may be fixed or performance based 
however  if costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations  the company may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs 
the company s ability to manage costs on each of these contract types may materially and adversely affect its financial condition 
cost over runs also may adversely affect the company s ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 
due to the size and nature of many of the company s contracts  the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials 
incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information for the company to assess anticipated performance 
estimates of award fees are also used in estimating sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards 
because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above  it is possible that the results could be different and the differences could be material if the company used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
changes in underlying assumptions  circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance 
for additional information regarding the company s accounting policies for recognizing sales and profits  see critical accounting policies above 
other risks associated with us government contracts may expose the company s business to adverse consequences 
like all us government contractors  the company is subject to risks associated with uncertain cost factors related to scarce technological skills and components  the frequent need to bid on programs in advance of design completion  which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and or cost overruns  the substantial time and effort required for design and development  design complexity  rapid obsolescence  and the potential need for design improvement 
failure to perform by one of the company s subcontractors  partners or suppliers could materially and adversely affect the company s performance and its ability to obtain future business 
many of the company s contracts involve subcontracts or partnerships with other companies upon which the company relies to perform a portion of the services the company must provide to its customers 
there is a risk that the company may have disputes with its subcontractors  including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor  customer concerns about the subcontractor  the company s failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract or the company s hiring of personnel of a subcontractor 
a failure by one or more of the company s subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact the company s ability to perform its obligations as the prime contractor 
subcontractor performance deficiencies could expose the company to liability and have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to compete for future contracts and orders 
in addition  in connection with certain contracts  the company commits to certain performance guarantees 
the company s ability to perform under these guarantees may in part be dependent on the performance of other parties  including partners and subcontractors 
if the company is unable to meet these performance obligations  the performance guarantees could have a material adverse effect on the company s product margins and its results of operations  liquidity or financial position 
in addition  several suppliers are the company s sole source of certain components 
if a supplier should cease to deliver such components  added cost and manufacturing delays could result  which may affect the company s ability to meet customer needs and may have an adverse impact on the company s profitability 
the company derives revenues from international sales and is subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 
the company derived approximately of its revenues from international sales during the year ended december  and  as a result  is subject to risks of doing business internationally  including changes in regulatory requirements that may adversely affect the company s ability to sell certain products or repatriate profits to the united states  domestic and foreign government policies  including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation requirements  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  delays in placing orders  the complexity and necessity of using foreign representatives and consultants  the uncertainty of adequate and available transportation  the uncertainty of the ability of foreign customers to finance purchases  uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees  the imposition of tariffs or embargoes  export controls and other trade restrictions  the difficulty of managing and operating of an enterprise spread over various countries  compliance with a variety of foreign laws  as well as us laws affecting the activities of us companies abroad  and economic and geopolitical developments and conditions  including international hostilities  acts of terrorism and governmental reactions  inflation  trade relationships and military and political alliances
