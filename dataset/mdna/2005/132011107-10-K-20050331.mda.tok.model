item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview the company s business consists of three segments bioproducts  biopharma and human health 
the bioproducts segment consists of research products and therapeutic applications 
the biopharma segment consists of the company s contract biopharmaceutical process development and manufacturing business 
the human health segment is primarily comprised of active pharmaceutical ingredients derived from organic chemistry and pharmaceutical intermediates 
members of the senior management team regularly review key financial metrics and the status and strategy of operating initiatives within our business 
these metrics include sales growth  gross margin performance  operating income margins  cash flows from operations  working capital levels  and return on capital employed at both a business unit and consolidated level in addition to earnings per share at a consolidated level 
management reviews this information on a monthly basis through extensive business unit reviews which include  among other operating issues  detailed discussions related to significant sales opportunities  proposed and ongoing investments in new businesses or property plant and equipment  cost reduction efforts  and the status of new product development 
in  the company continued to see strong growth across many product categories within its bioproducts segment 
the bioproducts segment is primarily driven by biotechnology research spending levels  the overall demand for endotoxin detection products and services and the company s ability to continually provide product upgrades and innovative new products and services 
the loss of a large customer in whose product did not receive fda approval negatively affected our biopharma segment and the company continues to take aggressive steps to replace this business 
the company believes its biopharma business will experience more volatility than its other businesses until such time that it is able to secure more long term commercial contracts  but believes the overall growth trend predicted for the contract biopharmaceutical manufacturing market will result in significant long term growth for businesses providing these services 
in the human health segment  the company saw net sales growth primarily driven by the impact of a weaker us dollar  with increases in sales of several active pharmaceutical ingredients offset by reductions in others  and pricing pressure within certain product categories 
this segment is driven primarily by patent expirations of branded drugs  population demographics  pressures to contain health care costs  the level of capacity available for outsourcing and the level of outsourcing by branded pharmaceutical companies 
during  the company evaluated the carrying value of the goodwill related to its baltimore site  which is reported in the biopharma segment  and determined that it may not be recoverable due to the lowering of baltimore s revenue and operating income forecasts for and beyond versus prior projections 
the company tested for impairment and determined that the carrying value exceeded its fair value  as determined by using a discounted cash flow model 
management utilized appraisals to determine the value of its tangible and identifiable intangible assets for purposes of determining the implied fair value of goodwill 
upon completion of the assessment  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of  to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the baltimore reporting unit to its estimated fair value of  refer to note for further details 
during  the company completed its transformation to a pure life sciences company with the sale of the rutherford chemicals business unit during the fourth quarter 
during  the company settled its mylan lawsuit and took a pre tax charge for approximately  as discussed more fully below and in note  and recorded valuation allowances against net domestic deferred tax assets totaling  within the provision for income taxes  explained more fully below and in note the company s tax rate may experience volatility from the mix of domestic and foreign earnings until such time that domestic operations achieve sustainable profitability 
dollars in thousands  except share data critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those which we believe require the most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other various assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management under each applicable circumstance 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the differences could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
a discussion of our critical accounting policies  the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions  is as follows revenue recognition revenues in our bioproducts and human health segments are generally recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers 
additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations 
sales terms to certain customers include remittance of discounts if certain conditions are met 
additionally  sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions 
the company estimates these rebates and estimated returns at the time of sale based on the terms of agreements with customers and historical experience and recognizes revenue net of these estimated costs which are classified as allowances and rebates 
some contracts in our bioproducts and biopharma segments are based on time and materials and revenue for those are recognized as services are performed 
the biopharma segment also utilizes contracts that contain milestone based payments 
the company utilizes the eitf revenue recognition of long term power sales contracts model for recording revenue from these contracts 
under this method  revenue is based on the cost of efforts since contract commencement up to the reporting date  divided by the total estimated contractual cost from the contract commencement to the end of the development arrangement  multiplied by the total expected contractual payments under the arrangement 
however  revenue is limited to the amount of nonrefundable cash payments received or contractually receivable at the reporting date 
in each of our segments we have certain contracts that contain multiple deliverables 
these deliverables often include process development services and commercial production 
the company follows the guidance contained in eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue for each element is recognized when delivered to the customer based on the fair value of the element as determined based on sales price when sold separately 
amounts billed in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet 
asset valuations and review for potential impairments in accordance with fas  our review of long lived assets  principally fixed assets and other amortizable intangibles requires us to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows generated from these assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
if undiscounted cash flows are less than carrying value  the long lived assets are written down to fair value which equals the discounted cash flows 
our review of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is done annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable in accordance with fas utilizing a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow model and compared to the carrying value 
if such analysis indicates that impairment may exist  we then estimate the fair value of the other assets and liabilities utilizing appraisals and discounted cash flow analyses to calculate an impairment charge 
dollars in thousands  except share data the determination of fair value for both fas and fas is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including projected future cash flows  discount rates  determination of appropriate market comparables and perpetual growth rates 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
as noted previously and in note  in the third quarter of  the company recorded a goodwill impairment loss of  related to its baltimore reporting unit 
the company s annual review for goodwill impairment  which was performed during the fourth quarter  did not result in any additional charges for environmental and litigation contingencies the company periodically assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for a discussion of our current environmental and litigation matters  reserves recorded and our position with respect to any related uncertainties 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  the company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that the company will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
if probable and estimable  the company accrues for the costs of clean up  settlements and legal fees 
if the aggregate amount of the liability and the timing of the payment is fixed or reasonably determinable  the company discounts the amount to reflect the time value of money 
given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of litigation and environmental matters  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions that the company may have made with respect to their resolution 
income taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
when assessing the valuation allowance  the company takes into account certain tax planning strategies 
the company s valuation allowances primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards  foreign tax credits  and alternative minimum tax credits in the us  where profitability is uncertain and net operating loss carryforwards in certain state and foreign jurisdictions with little or no history of generating taxable income 
employee benefit plans the company provides a range of benefits to employees and retired employees  including pensions  post retirement  post employment and health care benefits 
the company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations  which include various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost trend rates 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so 
the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods 
the company believes that the assumptions utilized for recording obligations under its plans are reasonable 
dollars in thousands  except share data results of operations as discussed in note of the accompanying financial statements  on november   the sale of rutherford chemicals was completed and accordingly  the business comprising the rutherford chemicals segment is being reported as a discontinued operation in all periods presented 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the selected consolidated financial information as a percentage of gross sales years ended december  gross sales net revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses impairment and other charges operating loss profit interest expense  net provision for income taxes loss income from continuing operations loss on discontinued operations net loss income the following tables show the gross sales of the company s three segments  in dollars and as a percentage of the company s total gross sales for the years ended december   and  as well as the gross profit by product segment for and years ended december  gross sales bioproducts    biopharma    human health    total gross sales    total net revenues    total gross profit    gross sales distribution bioproducts biopharma human health total gross sales distribution dollars in thousands  except share data gross sales gross profit by product segment gross gross gross gross gross gross sales profit profit sales profit profit bioproducts     biopharma     human health     total     compared to gross sales for increased to  from  in sales in the bioproducts and human health segments increased compared to more than offsetting the decrease in the biopharma segment 
gross sales were favorably impacted due to the exchange rates reflecting the weakness in the us dollar primarily versus the euro and swedish krona 
gross profit in was  compared to  in gross margin in decreased to from in  reflecting lower margins in the biopharma and human health segments partially offset by higher margins in the bioproducts segment 
the following table shows gross sales by geographic area for the years ended december  and north america   europe   asia   other   total   the bioproducts segment gross sales in of  were  or above bioproducts sales were favorably impacted due to exchange rates reflecting a weaker us dollar 
the increased sales before the impact of foreign currency are primarily due to higher sales across most product categories including research products  endotoxin detection products  bioservices sales and process development products due to stronger demand  higher pricing  new products and customers and investments in sales and marketing 
these higher sales were partially offset by lower sales in biotherapeutic serum mainly due to timing of shipments and stronger sales in the bioproducts segment gross margins increased primarily due to higher sales volume  increased pricing in most product categories  lower bad debt reserves due to favorable collections and favorable impact of foreign currency partly offset by higher costs for raw materials 
the biopharma segment gross sales in of  were or below the sales decrease primarily reflects reduced billings in our biopharmaceutical manufacturing business driven by the completion or timing of projects and a change in contract terms from time and material to milestone payments 
this decrease was partially offset by higher reimbursable materials revenue due to timing of current projects 
foreign currency had no impact on biopharma sales 
the biopharma segment gross margins were down significantly compared to the prior year due to higher production costs  increased fixed costs associated with the addition of the liter fermentation suite a new suite which will increase the production capabilities in the facility and higher reimbursable materials revenue which has very low margins 
dollars in thousands  except share data the human health segment gross sales in of  were  or above human health sales were favorably impacted due to exchange rates reflecting a weaker us dollar 
excluding the currency impact  the increase in sales is due mainly to higher sales of custom development products  a pharmaceutical intermediate used for end stage kidney treatment  higher sales of cardiovascular  gastrointestinal and alzheimer treatment apis  and higher sales of amphetamines due to higher volumes 
these sales were partially offset by lower sales of central nervous system apis due to increasing competition resulting in lower volumes sold 
the human health segment gross margins decreased due to pricing pressures on apis and other fine custom chemicals  unfavorable impact of foreign currency and higher production costs partially offset by increased sales volume and favorable product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  or as a percentage of gross sales in increased from  or in sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to additional sales and marketing personnel in our human health and bioproducts segments and the impact of foreign currency exchange 
higher administrative costs are primarily due to the impact of currency translation due to the weaker us dollar  regulatory compliance costs associated with the sarbanes oxley act and higher information technology  legal and environmental costs  partially offset by lower medical claims  the vesting of stock appreciation rights in the fourth quarter and lower pension expense 
research and development expenses of  were of gross sales in  compared to  or of gross sales in the increase primarily reflects investments in new product technologies for pathogen testing  higher custom development costs and the impact of foreign currency exchange partially offset by decreased spending for endotoxin detection technologies 
the results include a pre tax impairment charge of  during the third quarter of  the company evaluated whether the carrying value of the goodwill related to its baltimore reporting unit  which is a component of the biopharma segment  was recoverable due to the lowering of baltimore s revenue and operating income forecasts for and beyond versus prior projections 
the company tested for impairment and determined that the carrying value exceeded its fair value  as determined by using a discounted cash flow model 
management utilized appraisals to value its tangible and identifiable intangible assets for purposes of determining the implied fair value of goodwill 
upon completion of the assessment  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of  to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the baltimore reporting unit to its estimated fair value of  the company still has a substantial amount of goodwill related to this business and others  which may be subject to additional impairment charges if the business units do not perform at or near projected levels in the future 
certain other facilities do not have enterprise values that are significantly higher than the carrying value of goodwill 
refer to note for further details 
the results include a pre tax provision of  discounted to the present value of the five year pay out related to an agreement reached with mylan laboratories under which cambrex will contribute  to the settlement of consolidated litigation brought by a class of direct purchasers 
of this amount   has been paid as of december  with the balance due in equal installments over the next four years 
in exchange  cambrex received from mylan a release and full indemnity against future costs or liabilities in related litigation brought by the purchasers  as well as potential future claims related to this matter 
the operating loss in was compared to income of  in the results reflect lower gross margins in the biopharma and human health segments partially offset by higher margins in the bioproducts segment  the  pre tax charge for the goodwill impairment discussed above and higher operating expenses 
operating profit includes the  pre tax charge for the mylan settlement discussed above 
net interest expense of  in decreased from net interest expense was reduced by interest income accrued on an income tax refund  while in interest expense also included a dollars in thousands  except share data write off of deferred charges in associated with the day renewable senior revolving credit facility that was not renewed 
average debt balance  year over year  was virtually unchanged  while the average interest rate  net of the items discussed above  was in versus in the higher average rate in was due to the full year impact of million of privately placed long term debt  which carries a fixed rate that is currently higher than the company s revolving credit facility and the impact of slightly higher variable interest rates on the revolver 
the company recorded tax expense of  in compared to  in during  the company concluded that  of domestic deferred tax assets were deemed unlikely to be realized  and as such  valuation allowances for this amount were recorded against these assets 
since that time  the company has maintained a full valuation allowance on its domestic net deferred tax assets and no tax benefit has been recognized for domestic pre tax losses 
accordingly  for the year ended december  a valuation allowance of  on the company s domestic net deferred tax assets  including amounts related to the goodwill impairment charge  was recorded 
the majority of the tax expense represents taxes on international profits 
the company will continue to record a full valuation allowance on its domestic net deferred tax assets until an appropriate level of domestic profitability is sustained or tax strategies can be developed that would enable the company to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of the domestic net deferred assets would be realized 
if the company continues to report pre tax losses in the united states  income tax benefits associated with those losses will not be recognized and  therefore  those losses would not be reduced by such income tax benefits 
additionally  should domestic losses continue  it is possible that certain tax planning strategies preserving certain domestic tax assets could be deemed inadequate  resulting in additional valuation allowances in the future 
the carryforward periods for foreign tax credits  research and experimentation tax credits  net operating losses  and the federal alternative minimum tax credits are years  years  years and an indefinite period  respectively 
as such  improvements in domestic pre tax income in the future may result in these tax benefits ultimately being realized 
however  there is no assurance that such improvements will be achieved 
during the year end financial reporting process  the company identified certain accounting adjustments principally related to amortization of leasehold improvements  employee benefit accruals  inventory and taxes that impacted prior years and prior quarters within the cumulative impact of the prior years adjustments was a reduction to net income of and is not considered material to any prior period 
the prior years adjustment of has been reflected in the restated first quarter results 
the impact on net income for the first  second and third quarters of was a decrease of or per fully diluted share  an increase of or per fully diluted share and a decrease of or per fully diluted share  respectively 
the company has restated the results of the first three quarters of to reflect these adjustments 
the loss from continuing operations in was  or per diluted share versus income of  or per diluted share in the loss from continuing operations includes a goodwill impairment charge of  discussed above 
the income from continuing operations includes a charge of approximately  for the deferred tax valuation allowance and an  pretax charge for the mylan settlement both discussed above 
in the third quarter  the company announced that an agreement to sell the rutherford chemicals business had been signed and on november  the transaction was completed 
as a result  this business is being reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
the terms of sale resulted in a write down of assets to fair value of approximately  recorded in the third quarter of which was based on the selling price  including fees associated with the transaction 
in  loss on discontinued operations  net of tax was  including the write down of assets 
in  the company recorded an additional loss from discontinued operations primarily resulting from a working capital adjustment made in the first quarter of dollars in thousands  except share data the net loss in was  or per diluted share versus a net loss of  or per diluted share in the same period a year ago 
compared to gross sales for increased to  from  in sales in the human health and bioproducts segments increased compared to more than offsetting the decrease in the biopharma segments

the increased sales before the impact of foreign currency are primarily due to higher cell therapy services due to increased demand and higher sales of normal human cells and media products due to increased demand  higher pricing and new product launches in europe 
these increases were partly offset by the impact of the sale of the in vitro diagnostic cell business during the first quarter of the bioproducts segment gross margins decreased primarily due to additional bad debt reserves in and certain favorable inventory adjustments which did not repeat in  partly offset by favorable production volumes  pricing  cost reduction activities and the favorable impact of foreign currency 
the biopharma segment gross sales in of  were  or below the sales decrease primarily reflects the reduced volumes and suite utilization in our biopharmaceutical manufacturing business driven by the loss of a biopharmaceutical customer whose product failed to receive fda approval  changes in terms of an existing contract and completion of other contracts that were only partially replaced 
foreign currency had no impact on biopharma sales 
the biopharma segment gross margins were down significantly compared to the prior year due to lower suite utilization and lower pricing on an existing contract 
the human health segment gross sales in of  were  or above human health sales were favorably impacted due to exchange rates reflecting a weaker us dollar 
excluding the currency impact  the decrease results from the reduced pricing and market share of certain imaging products  lower shipments of a respiratory api due to reduced demand in the us  lower shipments of cardiovascular apis due primarily to the loss of a us customer and lower prices in europe 
partly offsetting these decreases were higher sales of central nervous system apis and a hypertension api due to increased demand  signing of a long term sales agreement for an api to treat alzheimer s disease and increased sales of crop protection and feed additive products due to high demand and successful implementation of higher capacity production lines 
the human health segment gross margins decreased due to pricing pressures on apis and other fine custom chemicals including a volume based rebate adjustment and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency partly offset by favorable product mix

the results include a pre tax charge of  for asset impairment and other charges related to the closure of a small manufacturing facility and other severance charges 
the operating profit in was  compared to  in the results reflect lower gross margins in all segments  the  pre tax charge for the mylan settlement discussed above and higher operating expenses 
net interest expense of  in increased from reflecting higher average interest rates due primarily to the higher fixed interest rate on certain senior notes issued in  partly offset by the lower average debt due primarily to cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the sale of the rutherford chemicals business 
the average interest rate was for the year versus in the provision for income taxes in resulted in an effective rate of as compared with in the same period of the combination of a loss due to the sale of rutherford chemicals  the mylan settlement  and a geographic shift of forecasted income resulted in  of domestic deferred tax assets being deemed unlikely to be realized  and as such  a valuation allowance for this amount was recorded against these assets in the deferred tax assets deemed unlikely to be realized for financial reporting purposes include foreign tax credit carry forwards  carrying a ten year life from inception  the tax benefit related to domestic net operating losses from continuing operations and research and experimentation tax credits that can be carried forward years  and a credit related to a federal alternative minimum tax that can be carried forward indefinitely 
the long carry forward period for domestic net operating losses and the alternative minimum credit and expected improvements in domestic continuing operations may result in these tax benefits ultimately being realized  however  there is no assurance that such improvements can be achieved 
the income from continuing operations in was  or per diluted share versus  or per diluted share in the income from continuing operations includes a charge of approximately  for the deferred tax valuation allowance and a  pretax charge for the mylan settlement both discussed above

the loss in includes pre tax charges of  for vitamin b litigation and  for asset impairment and other charges  pretax benefits of  due to a favorable insurance settlement and  for a favorable arbitration settlement 
in addition to the special items discussed above  the loss from discontinued operations included unfavorable product mix and higher energy and raw material prices 
the net loss in was  or per diluted share versus net income of  or per diluted share in liquidity and capital resources during cash and cash equivalents on hand increased  to  net cash flow from operations was  for the year ended for december   down from  in the decrease in cash flow is due primarily to loss of operating cash flows from rutherford chemicals  an increase in accounts receivable due to higher shipments in the fourth quarter compared to  and an increase in inventories due to timing of receipts partially offset by lower payments in for vitamin b litigation and the mylan legal settlement 
cash flows used in investing activities of  in included capital expenditures of  and the acquisition of genolife sa for approximately  compared to capital expenditures of  in cash flows from financing activities in of  included net borrowings of debt of  proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  partially offset by payment of dividends of  cash flows used in financing activities in were  including net repayments of debt of   to repurchase treasury stock and  to pay dividends offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  capital expenditures were   and  in  and  respectively 
in  part of the funds were used for suite expansion at our biopharma sites  cell therapy manufacturing capabilities  upgrades to powder media facilities and a large scale media preparation suite at our bioproducts sites  and warehouse upgrades and new small scale production equipment for generic pharmaceuticals at our human health sites 
in november  the company amended its five year syndicated senior revolving credit facility the year agreement of  which originated in november and expires in november the year agreement is led by jpmorganchase as the administrative agent 
the year agreement was amended to include an accordion feature which  if utilized  will allow for the increase of the total commitments of up to  with bank approval 
the year agreement allows the company to choose among various interest rate options and to specify the portion of the borrowing to be covered by specific interest rates 
under the year agreement the interest rate options available to the company are the following us prime rate  libor plus an applicable margin that ranges from 
to  or money market rate plus an applicable margin that ranges from 
to the applicable margin discussed above is based upon the ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda 
the company also pays a facility fee between

on the entire credit facility 
the bank loan is collateralized by dividend and distribution rights associated with a pledge of a portion of stock that the company owns in a foreign holding company 
this foreign holding company owns a majority of the company s non us operating subsidiaries 
dollars in thousands  except share data as of december   there was  outstanding and  undrawn under the year agreement 
of the undrawn amount   is available to be borrowed as of december  due to limits established in the credit agreement 
the year agreement is subject to financial covenants requiring the company to maintain certain levels of net worth  interest coverage ratio  leverage ratios and limitations on indebtedness 
the company complied with all covenants during in june  the company borrowed  in a private offering consisting of year guaranteed senior notes due in june with interest payments due semi annually at an annual rate of 
during october  the company borrowed an additional  in a private offering consisting of year guaranteed senior notes due in october with interest payments due semi annually at an annual rate of 
these notes rank equally with the company s other senior indebtedness 
the funds were used primarily to pay down existing bank debt and to provide cambrex with longer term fixed rate debt 
the and average interest rates were and  respectively 
contractual obligations at december   our contractual obligations with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows total long term debt  including capital leases       interest on debt  including swaps       operating leases       purchase obligations     mylan settlement      contractual cash obligations       see notes   and for additional information regarding our debt and other commitments 
management believes that existing sources of capital  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements 
a key to our access to liquidity is the maintenance of our strong long term credit ratings and ability to meet debt covenants to maintain certain levels of net worth  an interest coverage ratio and leverage ratios 
the company met all bank covenants during and does not anticipate any covenant compliance issues in the coming year 
any events that change the status of our ability to meet debt covenants or maintain our credit ratings could adversely impact our ability to fund operations 
our forecasted cash flow from future operations may be adversely affected by various factors including  but not limited to  declines in customer demand  increased competition  the deterioration in general economic and business conditions  as well as other factors 
see the risk factors section of this document for further explanation of factors that may negatively impact our cash flows 
any change in the current status of these factors could adversely impact the company s ability to fund operating cash flow requirements 
market risks in the normal course of business  the company uses a variety of techniques and instruments  including derivatives  as part of its overall risk management strategy to lower its exposure to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
currency risk management the company s primary market risk relates to exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions entered into by international operations which are primarily denominated in the us dollar  euro  swedish krona and british pound sterling 
the company currently uses foreign currency exchange forward dollars in thousands  except share data contracts to mitigate the effect of short term foreign exchange rate movements on the company s operating results 
the notional amount of these contracts at december  was  the company estimates the forward contracts to be approximately of the non local currency exposure during the period 
unrealized foreign exchange contract losses do not subject the company s actual results to risk as gains or losses on these contracts generally offset gains or losses on the transactions that are hedged 
given a scenario that the operating companies non local currency collections match their forecasts  and all exchange rates move against their local currencies  no more than  of pre tax profits for a twelve month period would be at risk 
this is based on unhedged risk of  as of december   the non local forecasted currency exposures were  of this forecasted exposure   was hedged with major banks and through offsetting inter company hedge contracts  thereby reducing the non hedged risk to  interest rate management each of the interest rate options in the revolving credit agreement includes floating rates 
this arrangement has the advantage of making lower interest rates available in a declining rate market 
however  it also exposes the company to any upward swings in interest rates 
the company has employed a plan to mitigate interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements to convert floating rates to fixed interest rates 
as of december   the company had eight interest rate swaps in place with an aggregate notional value of  at an average fixed rate of  and with varying maturity dates through the year the company s strategy has been to cover a portion of outstanding bank debt with interest rate protection 
at december   the coverage was approximately of our variable interest rate debt 
the swap stabilizes interest costs by converting floating or variable rates to fixed rates through a contract with a financial institution 
the company monitors the debt position and market trends to protect it from unforeseen shifts in interest rates 
for example  at december  the company had variable debt of  of which  is fixed by an interest rate swap 
holding all other variables constant  if the libor portion of the weighted average interest rates in the variable rate debt increased by basis points the effect on our earnings and cash flows would have been higher interest expense of contingencies the company is subject to various investigations  claims and legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities 
the company continually assesses all known facts and circumstances as they pertain to all legal and environmental matters and evaluates the need for reserves and or disclosures as deemed necessary based on these facts and circumstances and as such facts and circumstances develop 
environmental in connection with laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment  the company and or its subsidiaries is a party to several environmental proceedings and remediation investigations and cleanups and  along with other companies  has been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites superfund sites 
additionally  as discussed in the sale of rutherford chemicals section of note  the company has retained the liability for certain environmental proceedings associated with the rutherford chemicals business 
each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters will be decided unfavorably against the company 
the resolution of such matters often spans several years and frequently involves regulatory oversight and or adjudication 
additionally  many remediation requirements are not fixed and are likely to be affected by future technological  site  and regulatory developments 
consequently  the ultimate extent of liabilities with respect to such matters  as well as the timing of cash disbursements cannot be determined with certainty 
in matters where the company has been able to reasonably estimate its liability  the company has accrued for the estimated costs associated with the study and remediation of superfund sites not owned by the company and the company s current and former operating sites 
these accruals were  and  at dollars in thousands  except share data december  and  respectively 
the increase in the accrual is due to currency fluctuation of  payments of and an increase to the reserve of a portion of this increase relates to an increase in an existing reserve associated with the on going investigation and remediation at the company s carlstadt  new jersey location 
an assessment of remedial costs based on information currently known resulted in the increase

in february  the new jersey federal district court ruled that a lawsuit against cosan by the owners of property adjacent to the clifton location could be placed on the active calendar 
the outcome of this matter could also affect the reserves

the allegations arose from exclusive license agreements between profarmaco and mylan covering two active pharmaceutical ingredients apis 
the ftc alleged violations of the federal trade commission act  including unlawful restraint of trade and conspiracy to monopolize markets for the apis

on motion by the vitamin b defendants  the district court dismissed the litigation  under the long standing rule that foreign purchasers cannot sue in us courts under us antitrust statutes

the vitamin b defendants  supported by the us department of justice  appealed to the united states supreme court and oral arguments were heard on april  in june  the united states supreme court ruled that foreign purchasers could not sue in us courts under us antitrust statutes if the conduct at issue resulted in purely foreign harm 
however  the court left open potential claims where foreign injuries suffered by foreign plaintiffs were dependent upon domestic harm resulting from conduct that violates the us antitrust laws
