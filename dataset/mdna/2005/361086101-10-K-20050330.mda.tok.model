off balance sheet transactions the company was not a party to any off balance sheet transactions at december   or for any of the years ended december   or critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant policies are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations 
these policies require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies pertain to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  the impairment of excess of cost over fair value of net assets of acquired businesses and income taxes 
critical accounting policies are discussed regularly at least quarterly with the company s audit committee 
the technical services segment s revenues are based primarily on time and materials and are generally short term in nature 
revenues are recognized when services to customers have been rendered or when products are shipped and risk of ownership is passed to the customer 
the technical services business provides limited warranties to customers  depending upon the service performed 
warranty claim costs were not material during the three years ended december  the company s information technology services segment includes revenue recognized under multiple element arrangements with its customers  which requires the use of significant judgments and estimates by management 
the accounting policies for revenue recognition in the information technology services segment comply with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and with aicpa statement of position sop no 
software revenue recognition 
etif no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
sop no 
requires revenue to be recognized only after software is delivered  all significant obligations of the company are fulfilled  and all significant uncertainties regarding customer acceptance have expired 
in addition  the information technology services segment s revenues under long term service contracts are accounted for using a proportional performance method or on a straight line basis in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
the company s technical services and information technology services businesses evaluate and adjust allowances for doubtful accounts receivable through a continuous process of assessing accounts receivable balances on individual customers and on an overall basis 
this process consists of  among other tasks  a review of historical collection experience  current aging status and financial condition of customers 
as this process involves a significant amount of judgment and estimation  and sometimes involves significant dollar amounts  actual write offs could differ from estimated amounts  which could have a material effect on the results of operations of the company 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 which eliminates the amortization for goodwill excess of cost over fair value of net assets of acquired businesses and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
under sfas no 
 intangible assets with lives restricted by contractual  legal  or other means will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
as of december   the company had no intangible assets subject to amortization under sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
sfas no 
requires a two step process for testing impairment 
first  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists 
if an impairment is indicated  then second  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the unit s fair value to its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the amount of impairment for goodwill and other intangible assets is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its implied fair value 
based on valuations and analysis performed by independent valuation consultants and the company in the first quarter of  the company determined that the carrying value of its goodwill exceeded implied fair value  and therefore  the company recorded a non cash charge  after income taxes  of million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
no impairment charge was appropriate under the previous goodwill impairment standard sfas no 
 which was based on undiscounted cash flows 
based on valuations and analysis performed by the company at december   and  no additional impairment charge was required 
future evaluations of the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets are dependent on many factors  several of which are out of the company s control  including the demand for services provided 
to the extent that such factors or conditions change  it is possible that future impairments could occur up to the current goodwill carrying value of million  which could have a material effect on the results of operations of the company 
at december   the company had a significant amount of net deferred tax assets  which consisted principally of net operating loss carryforwards  alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences resulting from differences in the tax and book basis of certain assets and liabilities 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire  if unused  as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  and  million in the alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards have no expiration date 
based on evaluations performed by the company pursuant to sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of  a non cash valuation allowance of million was provided with respect to the company s federal and state net deferred tax assets see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards could be subject to limitation in the event of a change in ownership  as defined in the tax laws 
to the extent that factors or conditions change  it is possible that reductions in the non cash valuation allowance could occur up to the current valuation allowance of million  which could have a material effect on the results of operating of the company 
recent accounting pronouncement in december of  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for equity instruments of the enterprise  or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
the company is currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
r to determine which fair value based model and transitional provision to follow upon adoption 
the alternatives for transition include either the modified prospective or the modified retrospective methods 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock as the requisite service is rendered beginning with the first quarter of adoption 
the modified retrospective method requires recording compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
under the modified retrospective method  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
sfas no 
r will be effective for the company beginning in the third quarter of the impact of adoption on the company s consolidated financial statements is still being evaluated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from the adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are interest rates on the company s debt and investment portfolios and fluctuations in foreign currency 
the company centrally manages its debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
the company s investment portfolio consists of cash equivalents  accordingly  the carrying amounts approximate fair value 
the company s investments are not material to the financial position or performance of the company 
assuming variable rate debt of million at december   a one percent increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
a significant portion of the technical services business is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates see item technical services 
based on annual foreign currency based revenues and operating income of million and million  respectively  a one percent fluctuation of all applicable foreign currencies would result in an annual change in revenues and operating income of million and million  respectively
