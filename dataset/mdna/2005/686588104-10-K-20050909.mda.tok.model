cash flow statement net cash used in operating activities for fiscal was  compared to net cash used in operating activities for fiscal of  the increase in net cash used in operating activities of  during fiscal was primarily attributable to the increased activity in residential properties completed or under construction  site work costs and the acquisition of undeveloped land and improved building lots that will yield approximately  building lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately  in addition  restricted cash due from title company of  contributed to the increase in net cash used in operating activities 
this was partially offset by an increase in net income when compared with fiscal net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal this increase was primarily related to the acquisition of realen homes on july  net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  for fiscal the increase in net cash provided by financing activities of  is primarily attributable to an increase in financing to support the increase in real estate held for development as noted above 
lot positions as of june   the company owned or controlled approximately  building lots 
included in the aforementioned lots  the company had contracted to purchase  or has under option  undeveloped land and improved building lots for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  that are expected to yield approximately  building lots 
the company expects to utilize purchase money mortgages  secured financings and existing capital resources to finance the undeveloped land and improved building lot acquisitions described below 
contingent on the aforementioned  the company anticipates completing a majority of these acquisitions during the next several years 
undeveloped land acquisitions in recent years  the process of acquiring desirable undeveloped land has become extremely competitive  particularly in the company s northern region  mostly due to the lack of available parcels suitable for development 
in addition  expansion of regulation in the housing industry has increased the time it takes to acquire undeveloped land with all of the necessary governmental approvals required to begin construction 
generally  the company structures its land acquisitions so that it has the right to cancel its agreements to purchase undeveloped land by forfeiture of its deposit under the agreement 
as of june   all of the company s agreements to purchase undeveloped land were structured in this manner 
for fiscal  the company forfeited approximately  in land deposits and expensed approximately  in pre acquisition costs related to the cancellation of purchase agreements of which  related to contracts to purchase undeveloped land and  related to contracts to purchase improved lots 
included in the balance sheet captions inventory not owned variable interest entities and land deposits and costs of future developments  at june  the company had  invested in parcels of undeveloped land  of which  is deposits  a portion of which is non refundable 
the acquisition of these parcels of undeveloped land is expected to yield approximately  building lots 
the company attempts to mitigate the risks involved in acquiring undeveloped land by structuring its undeveloped land acquisitions so that the deposits required under the agreements coincide with certain benchmarks in the governmental approval process  thereby limiting the amount at risk 
this process allows the company to periodically review the approval process and make a decision on the viability of developing the acquired parcel based upon expected profitability 
in some circumstances the company may be required to make deposits solely due to the passage of time 
this structure still provides the company an opportunity to periodically review the viability of developing the parcel of land 
in addition  the company primarily structures its agreements to purchase undeveloped land contingent upon obtaining all governmental approvals necessary for construction 
under most agreements  the company secures the responsibility for obtaining the required governmental approvals as the company believes that it has significant expertise in this area 
the company intends to complete the acquisition of undeveloped land after all governmental approvals are in place 
in certain circumstances  however  when all extensions have been exhausted  the company must make a decision on whether to proceed with the purchase even though all governmental approvals have not yet been received 
in these circumstances  the company performs reasonable due diligence to ascertain the likelihood that the necessary governmental approvals will be granted 
at june   the company had preliminary approval for all of the parcels included in the balance sheet caption land held for development or sale and improvements 
improved lot acquisitions the process of acquiring improved building lots from developers is extremely competitive 
the company competes with many national homebuilders to acquire improved building lots  some of which have greater financial resources than the company 
the acquisition of improved lots is usually less risky than the acquisition of undeveloped land as the contingencies and risks involved in the land development process are borne by the developer 
in addition  governmental approvals are generally in place when the improved building lots are acquired 
at june   the company had contracted to purchase or had under option approximately  improved building lots for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  including  of deposits 
inflation inflation can have a significant impact on the company s business performance and the homebuilding industry in general 
rising costs of land  materials  labor  overhead  administrative costs and interest rates on floating credit facilities can adversely affect the company s business performance 
in addition  rising costs of certain items  such as lumber  can adversely affect the expected profitability of the company s backlog 
generally  the company has been able to recover any increases in costs through increased selling prices 
however  there is no assurance the company will be able to continue to increase selling prices to cover the effects of inflation in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments certain off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments are disclosed in various sections of the consolidated financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements and below 
some typical off balance sheet arrangements commonly affecting homebuilders include o cost sharing arrangements and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures capital contribution requirements  o debt and debt service guarantees  o surety bonds and standby letters of credit  o executed contracts for construction and development activity  and o variable interest entities  which are not consolidated 
each of these items are described below or in critical accounting policies following this section 
cost sharing arrangements and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures capital contribution requirements 
the company has developed and owned communities through joint ventures  accounted for using the equity method  with other parties in the past 
however  at the present time joint venture activities do not constitute a material portion of the company s operations 
in addition  the company has partnered with other homebuilders and developers  under cost sharing agreements  to acquire land and or to develop or improve common off site facilities  such as sewer treatment plants  that will benefit both parties 
most of these agreements are established as cost sharing agreements whereby the homebuilders and developers share in the cost of acquiring the parcel or improving the off site facility 
the company currently does not have any material unfunded commitments or capital contribution requirements with respect to joint ventures or cost sharing arrangements 
debt and debt service guarantees 
at june   the company had mortgage and other note obligations on the balance sheet totaling  the company currently does not have any off balance sheet debt service guarantees 
surety bonds and standby letters of credit 
as of june   the company had  in surety bonds and  in outstanding standby letters of credit in favor of local municipalities or financial institutions to guarantee the construction of real property improvements or financial obligations 
the  in surety bonds guarantee the construction of public improvements and infrastructure such as sewer  streets  traffic signals  grading  and wildlife preservations in connection with the various communities the company is developing 
surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from homebuilders and other real estate developers 
the surety bonds and standby letters of credit are renewable and expire upon completion of the required improvements 
standby letters of credit are a form of credit enhancement that is commonly required in real estate development to secure the construction of public improvements 
in the past three fiscal years  no surety bonds or standby letters of credit have been drawn on for use to satisfy the company s obligations to perform under the agreements with the public agencies 
executed contracts for site work and construction activity 
the company has entered into site work and construction contracts with various suppliers and contractors 
these contracts are for construction and development activity in the numerous communities the company has under development  and are originated in the normal course of business 
the site work contracts generally require specific performance by the contractor to prepare the land for construction and are written on a community by community basis 
for larger communities  site work contracts are awarded in phases in order to limit any long term commitment by the company or its contractors 
generally  site work contracts are completed in less than one year 
the company acts as a general contractor and contracts with various subcontractors at specified prices for construction of the homes it sells 
subcontractors generally work on a piece meal basis and are not awarded contracts for a specified number of homes 
these commitments are typically funded by construction loans and are originated in the normal course of business 
summary of outstanding obligations the following table summarizes the company s outstanding obligations as of june  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
for mortgage and other note obligations  payments due by period are shown based on the expiration date of the loan 
payments due during fiscal year ended june  payments due total thereafter in thousands obligations mortgage and other note obligations     operating leases     affordable housing contributions    total obligations      the above table does not include certain obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business  such as trade payables 
the above table also does not include any amounts needed to acquire lots or land under option or cancelable purchase contracts because these arrangements are completed only at the company s discretion  subject only to loss of option or deposit amounts and costs capitalized to date 
therefore  these option and cancelable purchase contracts do not represent binding enforceable purchase obligations 
as of june   the company had contracted to purchase  or had under option  undeveloped land and improved building lots for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million that are expected to yield approximately  lots 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of real estate assets  capitalization of costs  environmental liability exposure  miscellaneous litigation reserves  and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
variable interest entities are entities controlled by another entity through means other than voting rights 
fasb interpretation no 
provides guidance on determining whether and how a business enterprise should consolidate a variable interest entity 
fasb interpretation no 
requires significant use of judgment and estimates in determining its application 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of fasb interpretation no 
estimates 
impairment charges to reduce the company s real estate inventories to net realizable value are recorded using several factors including management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows  which include assumptions related to expected future demand and market conditions 
the adequacy of the company s impairment charges could be materially affected by changes in market conditions 
estimates for construction costs for homes closed are recorded in the period when the related home is closed 
these estimates are based on detailed budgets for each home and historical experience and trends 
if actual costs change  significant variances may be encountered 
reserves for the estimated cost of homes under warranty are recorded in the period in which the related home is closed and are based on historical experience and trends 
should actual warranty experience change  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
estimates for the costs to complete land development are recorded upon completion of the related land development project 
estimates for land and land development costs are allocated to development phases based on the total number of lots expected to be developed within each subdivision and are based on detailed budgets for the land development project and historical experience and trends 
if actual costs or the total number of lots developed changes  significant variances may be encountered 
revenue recognition 
the company primarily derives its total earned revenues from the sale of residential property 
the company recognizes residential revenue when title is conveyed to the homebuyer at the time of closing 
the company also sells developed and undeveloped land in bulk and under option agreements 
revenues from sales of land and other real estate are recognized when the company has received an adequate cash down payment and all other conditions necessary for profit recognition have been satisfied 
during fiscal  and  all sales transactions met the criteria for  and were accounted for  utilizing the full accrual method 
to the extent that certain sales or portions thereof do not meet all conditions necessary for profit recognition  the company would use other methods to recognize profit  including the percentage of completion  cost recovery and the deposit methods 
these methods of profit recognition defer a portion or all of the profit to the extent it is dependent upon the occurrence of future events 
also  in general  specific identification and relative sales value methods are used to determine the cost of sales 
management estimates of future costs to be incurred after the completion of each sale are included in cost of sales 
a change in circumstances that causes these estimates of future costs to increase or decrease significantly would affect the gain or loss recognized on future sales 
impairment 
the company assesses the impairment of its real estate assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value may not be recoverable 
indicators the company considers important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following o significant negative industry or economic trends  o a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  o a significant change in the manner in which an asset is used  and o an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to construct an asset 
real estate is stated at the lower of cost or estimated fair value using the methodology described as follows 
a write down to estimated fair value is recorded when we determine that the net book value exceeds the estimated selling prices less cost to sell 
these evaluations are made on a property by property basis 
when the company determines that the net book value of an asset may not be recoverable based upon the estimated undiscounted cash flow  an impairment write down is recorded 
values from comparable property sales will also be considered 
the evaluation of future cash flows and fair value of individual properties requires significant judgment and assumptions  including estimates of market value  development absorption  and remaining development costs 
significant adverse changes in circumstances affecting these judgments and assumptions in future periods could cause a significant impairment adjustment to be recorded 
capitalization of costs 
costs capitalized include direct construction and development costs  including predevelopment costs  interest on indebtedness  real estate taxes  insurance  construction overhead and indirect project costs 
costs previously capitalized related to any abandoned development opportunities are written off when it is determined such costs will not provide any future benefits 
any decrease in development activity may result in a portion of capitalized costs being expensed 
environmental liability exposure 
development and sale of real property creates a potential for environmental liability on the company s part as owner and developer  for its own acts as well as the acts of prior owners of the subject property or owners or past owners of adjacent parcels 
if hazardous substances are discovered on or emanating from any of its properties  the company and prior owners may be held liable for costs and liabilities relating to those hazardous substances 
the company generally undertakes environmental studies in connection with its property acquisitions 
in the event the company incurs environmental remediation costs  including clean up costs  consulting fees for environmental studies and investigations  monitoring costs  and legal costs relating to clean up  litigation defense  and the pursuit of responsible third parties  if these costs are incurred in connection with properties the company previously sold  then they are expensed 
the company capitalizes costs relating to land under development and undeveloped land as part of development costs 
costs incurred for properties to be sold are deferred and charged to cost of sales when the properties are sold 
should a previously undetected  substantial environmental hazard be found on the company s properties  significant liquidity could be consumed by the resulting clean up requirements and a material expense may be recorded 
further  governmental regulation on environmental matters affecting residential development could impose substantial additional expense on the company  which could adversely affect its results of operations or the value of properties owned under contract  or purchased by the company 
for additional information regarding risks associated with environmental hazards and environmental regulation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate income taxes 
estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws 
the company estimates actual current tax due and assesses temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  and changes in tax laws 
to the extent adjustments are required in any given period  the adjustments would be included within the tax provision in the statement of operations and or balance sheet 
these adjustments could materially impact our financial position and results of operations and liquidity

if an entity is deemed to be a vie  pursuant to fin  an enterprise that absorbs a majority of the expected losses of the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
for vies created before january   fin was deferred to the end of the first interim or annual period ending after march  the company fully adopted fin effective march  based on the provisions of fin  the company has concluded that whenever it enters into an option agreement to acquire land or lots from an entity and pays a significant deposit that is not unconditionally refundable  a vie is created under condition ii b of the previous paragraph 
the company has been deemed to have provided subordinated financial support  which refers to variable interests that will absorb some or all of an entity s expected theoretical losses if they occur 
for each vie created the company will compute expected losses and residual returns based on the probability of future cash flows as outlined in fin if the company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie it will consolidate the vie on its balance sheet

sab  revenue recognition which supersedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind the accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf the company adopted the provisions of this statement immediately  as required  and it did not have a significant impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  issued during the third quarter of  provides guidance on revenue recognition for revenues derived from a single contract that contains multiple products or services 
eitf also provides additional requirements to determine when these revenues may be recorded separately for accounting purposes

the fair value based method in fas r is similar to the fair value based method in fas in most respects  subject to certain key differences 
because there are no remaining unvested abp grants as of the adoption date and management does not believe that there will be significant change in the valuation methodologies  the company does not anticipate that the adoption of fas r will have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company
