item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
it is intended to supplement and highlight information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
the discussion set forth below contains certain statements that may be considered forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the company s actual results to materially differ from those projected in the forwarding looking statements 
for further information regarding forward looking statements  you should review the discussion under the caption forward looking statements on page of this report 
overview of performance the company derives substantially all of its revenue and income from community bank related activities 
the banks operate as typical community banking institutions and do not engage in any specialized finance or capital markets activities 
northway functions primarily as the holder of stock of its subsidiaries and assists in the management of the operations of its subsidiaries as appropriate 
the principal components of the company s income sources are net interest and dividend income 
net interest and dividend income is the difference between interest and fee income received on income earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowed funds 
our other sources of income include revenues from fee based services  such as debit card and atm fees and sales of securities 
economic and industry factors that could cause the company s financial performance to differ from expected results include changes in applicable federal and state regulations  changes in the hospitality industry on which the company s business is largely dependent  interest rate volatility  significant changes in loan losses which may affect the company s allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses  and changes in the securities market that would affect the performance of the company s investment portfolio 
management evaluates each of these factors on an ongoing basis to determine their impact and to effect any strategies necessary to mitigate these risks 
the company reported net income of  or per common share  in compared to net income of  or per common share  in and  or per common share  in return on average equity was in  compared to in and in return on average assets was in  compared to in and in during  the company recorded a decrease in interest and dividend income of  as a decrease in the average yield on earning assets of was only partially offset by an increase in average earning assets of  this was partially offset by the fact that the continuation of a low interest rate environment provided the company further opportunity to reduce its average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
during  the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased  resulting in a decrease in interest expense of  the company recorded a reduction in the provision for loan losses of  as the total provision for was  compared to  for the decrease in the provision for loan losses was the result of an ongoing review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income  excluding securities gains  increased  from last year 
this reflects  in part  the impact of a new non deposit product line introduced earlier in  in addition to our continuing efforts to maximize all components of noninterest income  including the introduction of bounce protection tm in less favorable market conditions for investment securities resulted in lower securities gains for the year than in  as realized gains decreased  to  noninterest expense increased  to  in compared to  in due primarily to an increase in salaries and benefits expense 
during  the company took advantage of the improved market conditions for investment securities and realized securities gains totaling  compared to  for the prior year 
the low interest rate environment resulted in significant mortgage refinancing activity 
the company decided to sell a portion of this loan volume in the secondary market based on the company s underwriting standards 
the result of these sales was an increase in gain on sale of loans of  to  in the current low interest rate environment also provided the company an opportunity to reduce its average cost of interest bearing liabilities by 
in addition  this rate environment allowed the company to increase its average outstanding borrowings at very attractive rates and use the proceeds to fund increases in both average loans and investments 
net interest and dividend income analysis fluctuations in interest rates as well as changes in volume and mix of income earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest and dividend income  the principal source of our income 
the discussion of net interest and dividend income is presented on a taxable equivalent basis  unless otherwise noted  to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax exempt assets 
the table below under the caption consolidated average balances  interest and dividend income expense and average yields rates  presents the average balances  income earned or interest paid  and average yields earned or rates paid on our assets and liabilities for the years ended december    and net interest and dividend income for decreased  or  compared to interest and dividend income decreased  or  in compared to the continued suppression of market interest rates during resulted in a decrease in the yield on average earning assets 
a decrease in the yield on loans was partially offset by an increase in average loan balances of  this resulted in a net decrease of  or  in interest and fees on loans 
the decrease in interest and fees on loans was partially offset by an increase in interest and dividend income on securities of  which was the result of an increase in average balances of  partially offset by a decrease in average yield of 
interest expense decreased  or  in compared to the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to a decrease in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities partially offset by an increase in average balances of  the increase in average balances is primarily the result of increases in average federal home loan bank fhlb advances of  total average deposits  including noninterest bearing dda  decreased  but a shift in the mix of deposits resulted in a decrease in time deposits of  partially offset by higher average balances in demand deposits  now accounts and savings accounts  which are all lower cost sources of funds for the company 
net interest and dividend income for increased  or  compared to interest and dividend income increased  in compared to this was due to an increase in average earning assets of  which increase was partially offset by a decrease in the yield on average earning assets 
interest income and fees on loans increased  which increase was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of  partially offset by a decrease in the average yield of 
furthermore  interest and dividend income on securities increased  as an increase in average securities of  was partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on securities of 
these increases in interest and dividend income were partially offset by a decrease in interest income on federal funds sold of  as the average balance decreased  and was accompanied by a decrease in the average yield of 
interest expense decreased  or  in compared to the decrease in net interest expense was due primarily to a decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities partially offset by an increase in average interest bearing liability balances of  the decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was a function of both the acquisition of long term debt at attractive rates as well as a decision by management to lower rates on interest bearing deposits 
the increase in the average liability balance is the result of increases in average fhlb advances of  as the company took advantage of the current low rate environment to borrow  in medium term advances at an average rate of 
furthermore  the average balance in junior subordinated debentures increased  as a result of the inclusion of this debt  which was issued during  for the full fiscal year as compared to six months in fiscal average interest bearing deposits increased  due primarily to the fact that deposits acquired in october were recorded for the full fiscal year 
the trend in net interest and dividend income is commonly evaluated in terms of average rates using net interest margin and interest rate spread 
the net interest margin is computed by dividing fully taxable equivalent net interest and dividend income by average total earning assets 
this ratio represents the difference between the average yield returned on average earning assets and the average rate paid for all funds used to support those earning assets  including both interest bearing and noninterest bearing sources of funds 
the net interest margin decreased to in after having decreased to in the decrease in the net interest margin for was a direct result of the decrease in the yield on earning assets  which decrease was only partially offset by the decrease in the cost of funds 
the interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread eliminates the impact of noninterest bearing funds and gives a direct perspective on the effect of interest rate fluctuations 
during  the net interest rate spread decreased to as the yield on earning assets declined and was only partially offset by a decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities of 
during  the net interest rate spread decreased to as the yield on earning assets declined and was only partially offset by a decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities of

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents the annual cost of providing an allowance for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the size of the provision for each year is determined by management based upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  the value of collateral and general economic factors 
the provision for loan losses was  in  a decrease of  from the provision recorded in the provision of  decreased  from the provision recorded in the provision for each of the three years was based upon a review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which is conducted on a quarterly basis 
these reviews are based upon many factors including the risk characteristics of the portfolio  trends in loan delinquencies  and an assessment of existing economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  review the banks allowances for loan losses and such review may result in changes to the allowance based on judgments different from those of management 
the decrease in the provision was due in part to a reduction in average impaired loans of  as well as the fact that the company realized significant recoveries during  which allowed the company to maintain its coverage ratio 
the decrease in the provision was due in large part to the recording of  to other expense for a provision for losses related to unfunded loan commitments such as unused lines of credit and unused portions of home equity loans 
this provision had previously been calculated as part of the allowance for loan losses 
although management utilizes its best judgment in providing for losses  there can be no assurance that the company will not have to change its provision for loan losses in subsequent periods 
management will continue to monitor the allowance for loan losses and modify the provision to the allowance for loan losses as appropriate

the company has a general policy of purchasing investment grade securities and us government securities to minimize credit risk 
all securities  however  carry interest rate risk  which affect their market values such that as market yields increase  the value of the company s securities decline and vice versa 
additionally  mortgage backed securities carry prepayment risk whereby expected yields may not be achieved due to the inability to reinvest proceeds from prepayment at comparable yields 
moreover  such mortgage backed securities may not benefit from price appreciation in periods of declining rates to the same extent as the remainder of the portfolio 
a portion of the securities portfolio is pledged to secure public deposits  short term securities sold under agreements to repurchase and treasury  tax and loan accounts

the company intends to continue to pay dividends on a quarterly basis subject to the financial condition and earnings of the company  capital requirements  and other factors  including applicable governmental regulations 
no dividends will be payable unless declared by the board of directors and then only to the extent funds are legally available for the payment of such dividends 
application of critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
allowance for loan losses 
allowance for loan losses are estimated at the individual banks based on estimates of losses related to customer loan balances 
in establishing the appropriate provisions for customer loan balances  the company makes assumptions with respect to their future collectibility 
the company s assumptions are based on an individual assessment of the customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the credit rating of the loans 
generally  these individual credit assessments occur prior to the inception of the credit exposure and at regular reviews during the life of the exposure and consider a the customer s ability to meet and sustain their financial commitments  b a customer s current and projected financial condition  c the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook  and d the economy in general 
once the company considers all of these factors  a determination is made as to the probability of default 
an appropriate provision is made  which takes into account the severity of the likely loss on the outstanding loan balances based on the company s experience in collecting these amounts 
the company s level of allowance for loan losses fluctuates depending upon all of the factors mentioned above 
goodwill and core deposit intangible 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 the company is required to perform annual impairment tests of its goodwill and intangible assets and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the company has elected to test for goodwill and intangible asset impairment in the fourth quarter of each year 
in that goodwill is carried on the books of the banks and the company owns of their outstanding stock  there is no market value for their common stock 
the company utilizes a multiple of earnings approach in analyzing the valuation of goodwill 
core deposit intangibles are carried on the books of the banks as well 
the valuation of core deposit intangibles incorporate deposits acquired compared with current deposit levels  considers deposit outflow assumptions made at acquisition as well as other factors 
the most recent impairment test of goodwill and core deposit intangible assets indicated that no adjustment was required 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and core deposit intangible that totaled  and  respectively  at december such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on the company s customer base  or the impact of changes in federal and state laws and regulations 
pension benefits 
the company maintains a trusteed non contributory pension plan the plan covering substantially all full time employees 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plan 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates 
the company considers market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the company determines the expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on the building block method  which consists of aggregating the expected rates of return for each component of the plan s asset mix 
plan assets are comprised primarily of mutual funds including bond funds  us equity funds  international equity funds  real estate funds and short term money market funds 
the company uses historic plan asset returns combined with current market conditions to estimate the rate of return 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption and generally does not change annually 
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments on the company s annual measurement date december and is subject to change each year 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are being recognized over approximately a year period  which represents the expected remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets 
these unrecognized losses will be systematically recognized as an increase in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with fas  employers accounting for pensions 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company in determining its pension benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
while the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
mortgage servicing rights msr or msrs 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through purchase or through sale of financial assets 
capitalized servicing rights are reported in other assets and are amortized into noninterest income in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost 
impairment is determined by stratifying rights by predominant characteristics  such as interest rates and original loan terms primarily and year 
fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics  when available  or based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
in periods of falling market interest rates  accelerated loan prepayment speeds can adversely impact the fair value of these mortgage servicing rights relative to their book value 
in the event that the fair value of these assets were to increase in the future  the company can recognize the increased fair value to the extent of the impairment allowance but cannot recognize an asset in excess of its amortized book value 
when the book value of an individual stratum exceeds its fair value  an impairment reserve must be recognized 
future changes in management s assessment of the impairment of these servicing assets  as a result of changes in observable market data relating to market interest rates  loan prepayment speeds  and other factors  could impact the company s financial condition and results of operations either positively or adversely 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by the company s boards of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the company s asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels trends 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and interest expenses associated with the company s financial instruments also change  thereby impacting net interest income nii  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet 
the company uses computer simulations to determine the impact on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics such as loan and deposit growth  loan and deposit pricing  changes in funding mix  and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
simulations based on numerous assumptions are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net interest income and capital 
from these scenarios  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a year horizon given both an immediate basis point  or  upward and downward shift in interest rates 
given the current level of interest rates  the company has modeled an upward shift in rates of basis points and a downward shift in rates of basis points 
using an immediate rate shock simulation where interest rates increase basis points  the december  earnings simulation model projects that net interest income for the twelve months ending december  would decrease by an amount equal to approximately 
in addition  utilizing an immediate rate shock simulation where interest rates decrease basis points  the december  earnings simulation model projects that net interest income for the twelve months ending december  would decrease by an amount equal to approximately 
using an immediate rate shock simulation where interest rates increase basis points  the december  earnings simulation model projected that net interest income for the twelve months ending december  would increase by an amount equal to approximately 
in addition  utilizing an immediate rate shock simulation where interest rates decrease basis points  the december  earnings simulation model projected that net interest income for the twelve months ending december  would decrease by an amount equal to approximately 
the projected results are within company s alco policy limits for both years 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including  among others  the nature and timing of interest rate levels  yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  and reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cashflows 
the assumptions differed in each of the periods included in the sensitivity analysis above 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
the most significant factors affecting the changes in market risk exposure during compared to were the continuation of the low interest rate environment  changes in the yield curve for investment securities  the increase in the aggregate principal amount in fixed rate loans extended by the banks  the aggregate increase in securities available for sale  the increase in total deposits  and the increase in long term debt 
liquidity risk liquidity risk management involves the company s ability to raise funds in order to meet its existing and anticipated financial obligations 
these obligations are the withdrawal of deposits on demand or at contractual maturity  the repayment of debt as it matures  the ability to fund new and existing loan commitments and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities 
liquidity may be provided through amortization  maturity or sale of assets such as loans and securities available for sale  liability sources such as increased deposits  utilization of the fhlb credit facility  purchased or other borrowed funds  and access to the capital markets 
liquidity targets are subject to change based on economic and market conditions and are controlled and monitored by alco 
at the bank level  liquidity is managed by measuring the net amount of marketable assets after deducting pledged assets  plus lines of credit  primarily with the fhlb  which are available to fund liquidity requirements 
management then measures the adequacy of that aggregate amount relative to the aggregate amount of liabilities deemed to be sensitive or volatile 
these include brokered deposits  deposits in excess of  term deposits with short maturities  and credit commitments outstanding 
additionally  the company requires cash for various operating needs including dividends to stockholders  the purchase of treasury stock  capital injections to the banks  and the payment of general corporate expenses 
the primary sources of liquidity for the company are dividends from the banks and reimbursement for services performed on behalf of the banks 
additionally  the company may utilize outside sources of funding such as the issuance of the trust preferred securities during cash and cash equivalents decreased by  during cash used for investing activities totaled  with lending activities utilizing  and investment purchases using  cash provided by financing activities totaled  this cash consisted of an increase in deposits of  an increase in repurchase agreements of  and  from fhlb advances partially offset by the repayment of maturing fhlb advances in the amount of  the net cash provided by operating activities totaled  and consisted primarily of net income of  and a decrease in other assets and other liabilities  net
