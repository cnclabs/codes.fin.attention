overview isramco  inc  a delaware company  is active in the exploration of oil and gas in israel and the united states 
the company acts as an operator of certain leases and licenses and also holds participation interests in certain other interests 
the company also holds certain non oil and gas properties discussed below 
critical accounting policies in response to the securities and exchange commission s release no 
cautionary advice regarding disclosure and critical accounting policies  the company identified the accounting principles which it believes are most critical to the reported financial status by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex of subjective decisions or assessment 
the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management 
evaluations of oil and gas reserves are important to the effective management of the company 
they are integral to making investment decisions about oil and gas properties such as whether development should proceed or enhanced recovery methods should be undertaken 
oil and gas reserve quantities are also used as the basis of calculating the unit of production rates for depreciation and evaluating for impairment 
oil and gas reserves are divided between proved and unproved reserves 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
unproved reserves are those with less than reasonable certainty of recoverability and are classified as either probable or possible 
the estimation of proved reserves  which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty  is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations and extrapolations of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines 
although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced  the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects  reservoir performance  regulatory approvals and significant changes in long term oil and gas price levels 
the calculation of unit of production depreciation is a critical accounting estimate that measures the depreciation of upstream assets 
it is the ratio of actual volumes produced to total proved developed reserves those proved reserves recoverable through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods applied to the asset cost 
the volumes produced and asset cost are known and  while proved developed reserves have a high probability of recoverability  they are based on estimates that are subject to some variability 
our cruise line operation is capital intensive 
at december   we have approximately  of net investment in the vessel recorded on our balance sheet 
we depreciate our assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimates of the useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
future events  such as property expansions  new competition and new regulations  could result in a change in the manner in which we are using certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than is temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
the company does not participate in  nor has it created  any off balance sheet special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing 
in addition  the company does not enter into any derivative financial instruments 
the company records a liability for asset retirement obligation at fair value in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long live assets 
liquidity and capital resources the company finances its operations primarily from cash generated by operations 
the company s operating activities provided net cash of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the availability of cash generated by operations could be affected by other business risks discussed in the risk factors section of this annual report 
working capital current assets minus current liabilities was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the increase in working capital is primarily attributable to increase of the value of marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal the increase in net cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to the purchase in march and maintenance  repairs and renovation of the vessel  and the outlays associated with the drilling of wells in texas and oklahoma  offset by the increase in the value of marketable securities

contractual obligations the company leases office facilities in texas and in israel and certain equipment pursuant to non cancelable operating lease agreements 
future minimum lease payments pursuant to these leases as of december  were as follows in thousands 
total thereafter operating leases texas     recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  and subsequently revised the interpretation in december fin r 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities  which have certain characteristics 
as revised  fin r is now generally effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending on or after march  we have no identified any variable interest entities 
in the event a variable interest entity is identified  we do not expect the requirements of fin r to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  sfas which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope  which may have previously been reported as equity  as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  for public companies 
the adoption of sfas no did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  an issue was bought before the financial accounting standards board regarding whether or not contract based oil and gas mineral rights held by lease or contact mineral rights should be recorded or disclosed as intangible assets 
the issue presents a view that these mineral rights are classified assets as defined in sfas no 
 business combinations  and therefore  should be classified separately on the balance sheet as intangible assets 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective for transactions subsequent to june   with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
required as of january  sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase method and that intangible assets be disaggregated and reported separately from goodwill sfas no 
established new accounting guidelines for both finite lived intangible assets and indefinite lived intangible assets 
under the statement  intangible assets should be separately reported on the face of the balance sheet and accompanied by disclosure in the notes to financial statements 
sfas no 
does not apply to accounting utilized by the oil and gas industry as prescribed by sfas no 
 and is silent about whether at not its disclosure provisions apply to oil and gas mineral rights to an upcoming agenda  which may result in a change in how isramco classifies these assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in commodity prices 
the company produces and sells natural gas and crude oil 
as a result  the company s financial results can be significantly affected if these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces
