item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are principally involved in the management and operation of broadband communications networks our cable segment and in the management of programming content that is distributed over national cable television networks our content segment 
in  we received over of our revenue from our cable segment  primarily through monthly subscriptions to our video  high speed internet and phone services  as well as from advertising 
subscribers typically pay us monthly  based on rates and related charges that vary according to their chosen level of service and the type of equipment they use 
revenue from our content segment is derived from the sale of advertising time and affiliation agreements with cable and satellite television companies 
we have several competitors in each aspect of our businesses  including satellite providers  dsl providers  telephone companies and broadcast networks 
highlights for the year include the following revenue growth of in our cable segment compared to the year  driven by continued subscriber growth in our digital cable and high speed internet services and rate increases in our video services 
our subscriber growth is attributable to new and improved products and advanced services in our digital cable and high speed internet services 
these include video on demand vod or on demand  high definition television hdtv programming and digital video recorders dvr s in our video services and a fast and reliable network  enhanced internet portal  video mail and additional content in our high speed internet services  operating income before depreciation and amortization growth of in our cable segment compared to the year  resulting from our revenue growth  efficiencies achieved and volume related savings based on our size  substantial completion of our cable systems upgrade  investment in and long term access to technology platforms and national fiber optic networks that allow us to control the development  delivery and quality of our digital and advanced services for our video  high speed internet and phone services  and repurchases of approximately million shares of our class a special common stock for aggregate consideration of billion pursuant to our board authorized repurchase program 
the following discussion provides the details of these highlights and insights into our consolidated financial statements  including business developments  critical accounting judgments and estimates used in preparing the financial statements  and discussions of our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
business developments we operate our businesses in an increasingly competitive  highly regulated and technologically complex environment 
we are the largest video  broadband high speed internet and cable phone service provider in the united states 
we have substantially completed the upgrade of our broadband communications networks  allowing us to provide customers with new and improved products and advanced services in our video  high speed internet and phone services 
we also have expanded the ownership and management of our content businesses on national  regional and local levels 
cable on november   we completed the acquisition of at t corp 
s broadband business  which we refer to as broadband and the broadband acquisition 
the broadband acquisition substantially increased the size of our cable operations and caused significant changes in our capital structure  including a substantially higher amount of debt 
as a result  direct comparisons of our results of operations for periods prior to november   to subsequent periods are not meaningful 
during  we expanded our efforts to acquire and develop technology that will drive product differentiation and new applications and extend our nationwide fiber optic network 
we achieved these objectives in through strategic agreements signed with gemstar tv guide and microsoft  which enable us to control and develop the enhancement of the user interface and the functionality of our service offerings  such as our interactive programming guide and our vod and dvr service 
in addition  we and gemstar formed an entity to develop and enhance interactive programming guides 
in december  we also announced a long term agreement with level communications that is part of the extension of our fiber optic network 
this national network  or backbone  provides a technically advanced  nationwide broadband network over which we can deliver new and enhanced services 
content on may   we completed the acquisition of techtv inc techtv for approximately million in cash 
on may   g and techtv began operating as one network that is available to approximately million cable and satellite homes nationwide as of december   and provides video and computer game related programming 
on july   we exchanged approximately million shares of liberty media corporation liberty series a common stock that we held with liberty for cash of million  an additional interest in e entertainment television e entertainment and of international channel networks  a cultural and heritage related national cable network that is available to approximately million cable homes nationwide as of december  qvc on september   we completed the sale to liberty of our approximate interest in qvc  inc for approximately billion 
we received from liberty billion of three year senior unsecured floating rate notes  approximately million shares of liberty series a common stock valued at billion  and cash of billion 
qvc is presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements 
refer to general developments of our business in part i and note to our consolidated financial statements included in item for a discussion of our acquisitions and other significant events 
critical accounting judgments and estimates we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for income taxes and legal contingencies are critical in the preparation of our financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them presented below 
valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise rights our cable systems are constructed and operated under non exclusive franchises granted by state or local governmental authorities for varying lengths of time 
as of december   we served approximately  franchise areas in the united states 
we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors limiting the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows 
accordingly  our cable franchise rights are not subject to amortization but are assessed periodically for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

we have acquired these cable franchise rights either directly from local franchise authorities or through many separate cable system acquisitions that include multiple franchise territories 
upon acquisition  we integrate the individual franchise territories into our national footprint  typically by incorporating the management of those territories into our existing geographic regions 
we control the sourcing of content  pricing  marketing and branding  and capital deployment throughout the company as if our cable franchise rights were a single asset 
therefore  we have concluded that we operate our cable franchise rights as a single asset within our cable segment 
from time to time  however  certain cable franchise rights may be separated and sold in units below the cable segment level 
we have concluded that emerging issues task force  unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets  supports the testing of our cable franchise rights for impairment at a level no higher than where the assets are both operated together and essentially inseparable 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
in  we tested our cable franchise rights for impairment at the cable segment level 
effective in the first quarter of  we changed the unit of accounting used for testing impairment to geographic regions 
we assess the recoverability of our cable franchise rights annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets  discounted cash flow analyses  analyses of current market transactions  and profitability information  including estimated future operating results  trends or other determinants of fair value 
if the value of our cable franchise rights determined by these evaluations is less than its carrying amount  an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets 
future adverse changes in market conditions or in the operating results of the related business may indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets  thereby possibly requiring a future impairment charge 
the carrying amount of cable franchise rights related to some of our historical cable systems is significantly less than their current estimated fair value largely because we acquired many of these rights directly from local franchise authorities rather than through separate cable system acquisitions 
conversely  the carrying amount of cable franchise rights for our more recent cable system acquisitions has not been significantly reduced through amortization and has not been reduced at all for acquisitions made subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 

nevertheless  testing for impairment at a level higher than the individual franchise agreement or cable system level reduces the likelihood of a future impairment charge related to our cable franchise rights 
income taxes our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income  changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities  income tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
from time to time  we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to some uncertainty 
examples of such transactions include business acquisitions and disposals  including like kind exchanges  issues related to consideration paid or received in connection with acquisitions  and certain financing transactions 
significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions 
we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities  and we record a liability when we believe that it is probable that we will be assessed 
we adjust our estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities  as well as changes in tax laws  regulations and precedent 
the financial statement effects of income tax uncertainties that arise in connection with business combinations and those associated with entities acquired in business combinations are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item the consolidated tax provision of any given year includes adjustments to prior year income tax provisions that are considered appropriate and any related estimated interest 
we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes 
differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution  individually or in the aggregate  are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow of any one period 
legal contingencies we are subject to legal  regulatory and other proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business and  in certain cases  those that we assume from an acquired entity in a business combination 
we record an estimated liability for those proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business based upon the probable and reasonably estimable criteria contained in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
for those litigation contingencies assumed in a business combination subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 we record a liability based on estimated fair value when such fair value is determinable 
we review outstanding claims with internal as well as external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss 
the risk of loss is reassessed as new information becomes available and liabilities are adjusted  as appropriate 
the actual cost of resolving a claim may be substantially different from the amount of the liability recorded 
significant and subjective estimates the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities 
we base our judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included in item for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these and other items 
results of continuing operations consolidated operating results revenues consolidated revenues for the years and increased billion and billion  respectively  from the previous year 
of these increases  billion and billion  respectively  relate to our cable segment and million and million  respectively  relate to our content segment  which are both discussed separately below 
the remaining changes primarily relate to our other business activities  primarily comcast spectacor 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses consolidated operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for the years and increased million and billion  respectively  from the previous year 
of these increases  million and billion  respectively  relate to our cable segment and million and million  respectively  relate to our content segment  both of which are discussed separately below 
the remaining increases relate to our other business activities  primarily comcast spectacor and corporate activities 
depreciation the changes in depreciation expense for the years and are primarily attributable to our cable segment 
the increase in our cable segment for the year compared to the previous year is principally due to the higher level of depreciation associated with capital expenditures related to our cable systems upgrade 
the increase in our cable segment for the year compared to the previous year is principally due to the effects of the broadband acquisition  as well as our increased level of capital expenditures 
amortization the changes in amortization expense for the years and are primarily attributable to our cable segment 
the decrease in our cable segment for the year compared to the previous year relates to decreases in the amortization of our franchise related customer relationship intangible assets 
as a result of the broadband acquisition  we recorded approximately billion of franchise related customer relationship intangible assets  which we are amortizing over their average estimated useful life of approximately four years 
in the fourth quarter of  we reduced the value of these intangible assets because we obtained updated valuation reports  which resulted in lower amortization expense 
this decrease was partially offset by amortization associated with intangibles acquired in the gemstar transaction 
this decrease was also offset by our content segment  principally associated with intangibles acquired in the techtv and liberty exchange transactions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item for further discussion about these transactions 
the increase in our cable segment for the year compared to the previous year relates principally to the effects of the broadband acquisition 
to historical comparisons on november   we completed the acquisition of at t corp 
s broadband business  which we refer to as broadband and the broadband acquisition 
the broadband acquisition substantially increased the size of our cable operations and caused significant changes in our capital structure  including a substantially higher amount of debt 
as a result  direct comparisons of our consolidated results of operations for periods prior to november   to subsequent periods are not meaningful 
please refer to our to historical and pro forma cable segment discussion below 
segment operating results operating income before depreciation and amortization is the primary basis we use to measure the operational strength and performance of our segments 
operating income before depreciation and amortization is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization  impairment charges  if any  related to fixed and intangible assets  and gains or losses from the sale of assets  if any 
as such  it eliminates the significant level of non cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital intensive nature of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations  and it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities 
our management and board of directors use this measure in evaluating our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of all of our operating segments 
this metric is used to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments and is a significant component of our annual incentive compensation programs 
we believe that this measure is also useful to investors as it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with other companies in our industries  although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies 
because we use operating income before depreciation and amortization as the measure of our segment profit or loss  we reconcile it to operating income  the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  in the business segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income loss  net income loss  net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with gaap 
all percentages are calculated based on actual amounts 
minor differences may exist due to rounding

operating expenses 
programming expenses represent our single largest operating expense and are fees paid to license programming from cable networks that we distribute  package and sell to our video subscribers 
programming expenses are impacted by changes in programming rates  the number of subscribers and the programming packages offered to subscribers 
in  programming costs increased million to billion  or  from we anticipate our programming expenses will increase in the future primarily as a result of increased costs to purchase programming and as additional programming is provided to our subscribers 
we anticipate that these increases will be mitigated  to some extent  by additional volume discounts 
other operating expenses increased million  or  from  primarily driven by increases in personnel associated with the growth in our high speed internet and digital cable services

to pro forma comparisons management uses pro forma data to evaluate performance when significant acquisitions or dispositions occur 
historical data reflects results of acquired businesses only after the acquisition dates  while pro forma data enhances comparability of financial information between periods by adjusting the data as if the acquisitions or dispositions occurred at the beginning of the prior year 
our pro forma data is only adjusted for the timing of acquisitions and does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities  cost savings or synergies that have or may be achieved by the combined businesses 
in the opinion of management  this information is not indicative of what our results would have been had we operated broadband since january   nor is it indicative of our future results

the increase in video revenue from to is primarily due to increases in monthly average revenue per video subscriber as a result of rate increases in our traditional video service  growth in digital subscribers  and repricing and repackaging of the digital and premium channel services in the broadband systems 
during  we added approximately  digital subscribers 
the increase in high speed internet revenue from to is primarily due to the addition in of approximately  high speed internet subscribers and is also due to the effects of an increase in monthly average revenue per subscriber 
the decrease in phone revenue from to is primarily a result of our focusing on operating efficiencies to drive profitability in the phone business  rather than focusing on subscriber growth 
as a result  during  our phone subscribers decreased by approximately  subscribers 
the increase in advertising sales revenue from to is primarily due to the effects of growth in regional national advertising as a result of the continued success of our regional interconnects  offset by reduced growth in a soft local advertising market 
other revenue includes revenue from our regional sports programming networks  installation revenues  guide revenues  commissions from electronic retailing and reduced revenue from other service offerings 
the increase in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers from to is primarily attributable to the increase in our revenues upon which the fees apply

the decrease in interest expense for the year from is a result of our debt reduction during and and due to the effects of our interest rate risk management program 
this decrease was offset somewhat by the effects of the write off of unamortized debt issue costs to interest expense in connection with the refinancing of our previously existing revolving credit facilities and by the early redemption of a portion of the comcast exchangeable notes 
the costs during associated with the refinancing and the redemption totaled million and million  respectively

we have entered into derivative financial instruments that we account for at fair value and which economically hedge the market price fluctuations in the common stock of most as of december  of our investments accounted for as trading securities 
the differences between the unrealized gains losses on trading securities and the mark to market adjustments on derivatives related to trading securities  as presented in the table above  result from one or more of the following we did not maintain an economic hedge for our entire investment in the security during some portion or for all of the period  the security to which the derivative relates changed due to a corporate reorganization of the issuing company to a security with a different volatility rate  the issuing company paid a new or an increased dividend to the shareholders of the security  or the change in the time value component of the derivative value during the period 
the mark to market adjustments on derivatives and hedged items consist principally of the fair value adjustments related to the derivative component of the notes exchangeable into comcast stock 
we are exposed to changes in the fair value of this derivative since the underlying shares of comcast class a special common stock that we hold in treasury are carried at our historical cost and not adjusted for changes in fair value 
as of december   approximately million shares of comcast class a special common stock collateralize the outstanding comcast exchangeable notes 
equity in net losses of affiliates 
the increase in equity in net losses of affiliates from to results principally from the effects of our additional investments and changes in the net income or loss of our equity method investees 
other income 
the increase in other income from to is primarily attributable to the million reduction in the estimated fair value liability associated with the at t securities litigation recorded as part of the broadband acquisition and the million gain recognized on the sale of our interest in dhc ventures  llc discovery health channel 
refer to notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in item for a discussion of this settlement and this sale 
the increase in other income from to is primarily attributable to lease rental income related to certain assets acquired in the broadband acquisition 
income tax expense benefit 
the changes in income tax expense benefit are primarily the result of the effects of changes in our income loss from continuing operations before taxes and minority interest 
minority interest 
the decrease in minority interest from to is attributable to the effects of our adoption of sfas no 
on july   upon which we now record our subsidiary preferred dividends  previously included within minority interest  to interest expense and  to a lesser extent  to increases in the net losses of some of our less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries 
the increase in minority interest from to is attributable to increases in the net income of our less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries and to dividends recorded to minority interest related to certain subsidiaries acquired in the broadband acquisition prior to the adoption of sfas no 
on july  discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations decreased from to primarily as a result of the period s including the results of qvc through august  while the period includes qvc s results for the full year 
as a result of the sale of qvc  we recognized a billion gain  net of approximately billion of related income taxes

r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
in addition  sfas no 
r will cause unrecognized expense based on the amounts in our pro forma footnote disclosure related to options vesting after the date of initial adoption to be recognized as a charge to results of operations over the remaining vesting period 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
r in our third quarter of  beginning july  under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition alternatives include prospective and retroactive adoption methods 
under the retroactive methods  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and share awards at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and share awards beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
r and we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas no 
r 
liquidity and capital resources during  we continued to strengthen our balance sheet through the repayment and refinancing of debt  and improved our liquidity through the sales or exchanges of our investments  which are more fully described below 
we believe that we will be able to meet our current and long term liquidity and capital requirements  including fixed charges  through our cash flows from operating activities  existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  through available borrowings under our existing credit facilities  and through our ability to obtain future external financing 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations amounted to billion for the year ended december   due principally to our operating income before depreciation and amortization  the effects of interest and income tax payments  proceeds from sales or exchanges of trading securities  and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
during  we made cash payments for interest totaling billion 
we anticipate that  for the foreseeable future  our cash paid for interest will decline modestly as average debt balances decline but will remain significant 
during  we made cash payments for income taxes totaling million  primarily as a result of state income taxes associated with our net income 
offsetting the cash payments were federal income tax refunds received during of approximately million 
we anticipate that our income tax payments will increase as our income increases and certain tax audits are settled 
also contributing to the increase in our cash flow from operating activities was million of proceeds received on the sale or exchange of our trading securities  including million received in connection with the liberty exchange transaction in july and million received in connection with our sale of million shares of liberty international common stock in december although the presentation of these proceeds within cash provided by operating activities is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these amounts are not indicative of our recurring operations  but result from sales of investments 
during  the net change in our operating assets and liabilities was million 
the changes in operating assets and liabilities are primarily a result of million in cash payments for liabilities recorded associated with the broadband acquisition 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was billion for the year ended december   and consists principally of our net repayments of debt of billion and repurchases of common stock of billion 
during the year ended december   our debt repayments and borrowings consisted of the following repayments million under senior and medium term notes  million under revolving credit facilities  million of comcast exchangeable debt and million under capital leases and other debt instruments 
borrowings million under revolving credit facilities  million  net under our commercial paper program and million under other debt instruments 
we have made  and may  from time to time in the future  make optional repayments on our debt obligations  which may include open market repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures  depending on various factors  such as market conditions 
commercial paper program 
in june  we entered into a commercial paper program to provide a lower cost borrowing source of liquidity to fund our short term working capital requirements 
the program allows for a maximum of billion of commercial paper to be issued at any one time 
our revolving bank credit facility supports this program 
as of december   amounts outstanding under the program totaled million with a weighted average interest rate of 
available borrowings under credit facilities 
we have traditionally maintained significant availability under our lines of credit to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
in january  we refinanced three of our existing revolving credit facilities with a new billion  five year revolving bank credit facility due january the interest rate for borrowings under this revolver is libor plus based on our current credit ratings 
we have four lines of credit aggregating billion and  as of december   amounts available under our lines of credit totaled billion 
the cross guarantee structure 
we and a number of our wholly owned subsidiaries that hold substantially all of our cable assets have unconditionally guaranteed each other s debt securities and indebtedness for borrowed money  including amounts outstanding under the billion bank credit facility 
as of december   billion of our debt was included in the cross guarantee structure 
comcast holdings corporation  our immediate predecessor and now a subsidiary  is not a guarantor and none of its debt is guaranteed under the cross guarantee structure 
as of december   million of our debt was outstanding at comcast holdings 
debt covenants 
we and our cable subsidiaries that have provided guarantees are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreement governing our bank credit facilities 
we and the guarantors are in compliance with the covenants and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business or raise additional capital 
the two financial covenants in our bank credit facility are tested on an ongoing basis and measure our leverage and interest coverage 
we have significant headroom under these financial covenants 
future compliance with these financial covenants is not dependent on further debt reduction or on improved operating results 
exchangeable notes 
we have outstanding notes exchangeable into the common stock of cablevision class a common stock  microsoft common stock  vodafone adrs and comcast class a special common stock together  the exchangeable notes 
at maturity the exchangeable notes are mandatorily redeemable at our option into i a number of shares of common stock or adrs equal to the underlying shares multiplied by an exchange ratio as defined  or ii its cash equivalent 
the maturity value of the exchangeable notes varies based upon the fair market value of the security to which it is indexed 
the exchangeable notes are collateralized by our investments in cablevision  microsoft and vodafone  respectively

we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and are not a party to leveraged instruments 
we manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties 
although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties  we do not expect such losses  if any  to be significant 
these derivative financial instruments  which can include swaps  rate locks  caps and collars  represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program

the estimated fair value approximates the proceeds necessary to settle the outstanding contracts 
we estimate interest rates on variable debt using the average implied forward london interbank offered rate libor rates for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect at december   plus the borrowing margin in effect for each credit facility at december  we estimate the floating rates on our swaps using the average implied forward libor rates for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect at december  excluding the effects of interest rate risk management instruments  of our total debt as of december   was at variable rates  compared to at december  as a matter of practice  we typically do not structure our financial contracts to include credit ratings based triggers that could affect our liquidity 
in the ordinary course of business  some of our swaps could be subject to termination provisions if we do not maintain investment grade credit ratings 
as of december   the estimated fair value of the proceeds to be received related to those swaps was immaterial 
the amount due or to be received upon termination  if any  would be based upon the fair value of those outstanding contracts at that time
