executive overview during the past three years  the company has experienced net losses 
these losses  combined with a build up in inventory  which are primarily the result of lower sales volumes related to recent market declines in the rv industry  have negatively impacted the company s liquidity 
in response to these conditions  the company has implemented initiatives to increase sales volumes through new product and floorplan introductions and the addition of new dealers  to reduce all categories of inventory  to re balance head counts to current retail sales supported production levels  to improve manufacturing efficiencies  and to further reduce manufacturing and other overhead costs 
in the company had a net loss of million or per share  compared to its net loss of million or per share in the company s results give effect to the establishment of a full valuation allowance in the amount of million against the company s net deferred tax asset as of the end of recent cumulative losses  the downturn in current market conditions and its impact on near term earnings outweighed other factors including the long carryforward periods and the company s forecasted long term profitability and led the company to conclude that it was more likely than not that its recorded net deferred tax assets will not be realized resulting in the full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset as of december  in  the company improved its gross margins by basis points from in to in the company also finished the year with a increase in market share  the third largest annual market share percent increase of the top ten class a manufacturers as reported by statistical surveys  inc key to the company s improvement in were new and enhanced product offerings  and improving profit margins driven by various cost reduction and efficiency initiatives with reduced workers compensation and warranty costs being two of the most significant cost reduction areas 
additionally  had the benefit of a full year of the new inspire product sales which was a significant factor in the company s overall increase in sales over in addition  during the third quarter  the company sold its travel trailer business  which it recorded as a discontinued operation 
the sale was designed to allow the company to further concentrate its efforts and resources on its growing motorhome business 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded net losses from discontinued operations of million  million and million  respectively

in addition to these measures  which are helping  the company believes that its workers compensation costs should be further reduced by recent state reforms 
other factors leading to the improvement in gross profit margin percentage from last year include higher sales  increased production levels at both nrv and cci  price increases  and reduced discounting  partially offset by production inefficiencies 
as the company has introduced new and revitalized products it has seen a rise in wholesale deliveries and an improvement in class a retail market share  to in from in both the industry and the company have experienced a shift to the more profitable diesel versus gas product lines 
stronger product offerings and the resulting increase in demand have reduced the need to discount many of the company s products through most of though there can be no assurance that future demand and competitive conditions will not cause the company to increase discounts in future periods 
looking ahead many of the same objectives the company addressed last year remain in place for the current year  including aggressive product development  cost containment  and increased customer satisfaction 
in addition  the company will focus on increasing its dealer body in with particular emphasis on the midwest  northeast  and east coast 
the fourth quarter saw the release of the remaining model year offerings 
nrv introduced the re designed tradewinds and islander diesel powered products at the industry s annual tradeshow in early december these two diesel products  which began to hit the market in meaningful numbers in the second quarter of  represent significant additions to the company s offerings given the relative strength of the class a motorhome diesel segment

though rvia expects substantial growth for the industry in the long term or decade ahead  rvia expects a decline in the industry in the near term or each of the years and this analysis of the company s financial condition and operating results should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company has performed an evaluation of its ability to continue as a going concern and believes it has sufficient financial resources to fund its operations through at least december  accordingly  the consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern  which contemplates the realization of the assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of the company s critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that the company believes are i the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and ii that require the company s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of long lived assets effective the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company assesses the fair value and recoverability of its long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in doing so  the company makes assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows and other factors 
the fair value of the long lived assets is dependent upon the forecasted performance of the company s business and the overall economic environment 
when the company determines that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable  it measures impairment based upon a forecasted discounted cash flow method 
the following table provides the estimated useful lives used for each asset type computer software hardware years furniture and fixtures years machinery and equipment years buildings and building improvements years warranty reserve the company s warranty reserve is established based on its best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
the company records an estimate for future warranty related costs based on recent actual warranty claims and historical experience 
also  the company s recall reserve is established  as necessary  based on management s estimate of the cost per unit to remedy a recall problem and the estimated number of units that will ultimately be brought in for the repair 
in addition  from time to time  the company is involved in warranty or lemon law litigation arising out of its operations in the normal course of business 
to date  the number of such matters as a percentage of sales is low and the aggregate cost to the company for these actions have not been material 
while the company s warranty costs have historically been within its expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same warranty costs that it has in the past 
a significant increase in dealer shop rates  the cost of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer  iii the price is fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
during the fourth quarter of  nrv began delivering motorhomes to its customers through independent third party carriers 
title and risks of rewards of ownership are transferred to a customer upon delivery of a motorhome to a third party carrier 
when all of the above criteria are satisfied  motorhome sales are generally recorded by nrv at the time the motorhomes are delivered to an independent third party carrier and are recorded by cci  which does not deliver its motorhomes through an independent third party carrier  when accepted by the dealer 
in addition  as is common throughout the rv industry  the company offers incentives to its dealers in the form of discounts and floorplan interest reimbursement programs  rebate and holdback programs  and retail sales incentives paid to dealer retail salespersons 
the company recognizes and records the costs of these incentives in accordance with emerging issue task force eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
discounts and floorplan interest reimbursement programs are offered to dealers on purchases of certain units during dealer or other trade show events 
the company will occasionally also offer these programs to its dealers to sell slower moving units 
the company recognizes the cost of these programs as a reduction of revenue and generally records the cost of discounts when the associated revenue is recognized 
rebate and holdback programs involve payments by the company to the dealer based on either a percentage of the net invoice price or a predetermined amount based on the model of the coach sold by the dealer 
the dealer incentive program varies by dealer 
not all dealers participate 
the purpose of the program is to provide an additional incentive to the dealer to promote sales of the product 
the dealers earn the incentive upon the wholesale purchase of the unit from the company 
the company recognizes these incentives as a reduction of revenue and records the cost of these incentives when the associated revenue is recognized 
the company often pays retail sales incentives directly to dealer retail salespersons to promote the sale of the product and the return of sale and warranty information 
this information assists in providing sales and marketing data to the company 
the company recognizes the cost of such retail sales incentives as a reduction of revenue and records the cost of such retail sales incentives when the associated revenue is recognized 
cooperative advertising arrangements exist through which dealers receive a certain allowance of the total purchases from the company if certain qualitative advertising criteria are met and if specified amounts are spent on the advertisements 
a dealer must maintain documentation of all advertising performed that includes the company s products and provide that documentation to the company upon request 
because the company receives an identifiable advertising benefit from the dealer  the company recognizes the cost of cooperative advertising as a selling expense and records the cost of cooperative advertising when the units are sold to the dealers 
legal proceedings the company is involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business  including a variety of warranty  lemon law and product liability claims typical in the recreation vehicle industry 
with respect to product liability claims  the company s insurance policies cover  in whole or in part  defense costs and liability costs for personal injury or property damage excluding damage to company motorhomes 
while it is impossible to estimate with certainty the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to this litigation  management is of the opinion that while the final resolution of any such litigation may have an impact on the company s consolidated results for a particular reporting period  the ultimate disposition of such litigation will not have any material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company estimates its income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenues and expenses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
the company is required to assess the likelihood that its net deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that its recorded net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary  the company is required to take into account all positive and negative evidence with regard to the utilization of a deferred tax asset  including the company s past earnings history  market conditions  management profitability forecasts  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a net deferred tax asset 
sfas no 
further states that it is difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
recent cumulative losses  the downturn in current market conditions and its impact on near term earnings outweighed other factors including the long carryforward periods and lead the company to conclude that it was more likely than not that its recorded net deferred tax assets will not be realized resulting in the full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset as of december  as a result  the company has recorded a non cash charge of million to establish a full valuation allowance against its december  net deferred tax asset 
the company expects to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until it can sustain an appropriate level of profitability and until such time  the company would not expect to recognize any significant tax benefits in its future results of operations 
during  the company s income tax expense was million million for continuing operations partially offset by a million income tax benefit for discontinued operations as a result of the company s full valuation allowance 
the provision for tax liabilities involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations by various taxing authorities 
in situations involving tax related uncertainties  the company provides for tax liabilities when it determines it is probable and estimable that additional taxes may be due 
as additional information becomes available  or these uncertainties are resolved with the taxing authorities  revisions to these liabilities may be required  resulting in additional provision for or benefit from income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations in the period such determination is made 
valuation of inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost estimated using the first in  first out method or market 
the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of inventories and maintains a reserve for excess and obsolescence to adjust the carrying value as necessary to the lower of cost or market or to amounts on hand to meet expected demand in the near term 
specifically  service and slow moving parts not being used in the manufacture of current model year motorhomes are reviewed by the company to determine which can be used in production  which can be used for future service and warranty repairs of customer owned motorhomes  and which can be returned to suppliers for full or partial credit 
in addition  prior model year finished good motorhomes are evaluated by the company and the value of those motorhomes is adjusted to an estimated market value based on a combination of the national automobile dealers association guide and the company s general industry knowledge 
the inventory reserves are reviewed each fiscal quarter and revisions are made as necessary 
unfavorable changes in obsolete inventory estimates would result in an increase in the inventory reserve and a decrease in gross profit 
workers compensation reserve the company s workers compensation reserve is established based on its best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing employee workers compensation claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the company records a reserve estimate for future workers compensation related costs based on the company s historical workers compensation claims paid history using an actuarial incurred but not reported ibnr approach 
even though the company s workers compensation costs declined during  the company cannot provide assurance that these costs will continue at these levels  increase or decrease  in the near term 
a significant change in california workers compensation legislation  the cost of claims or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts on its accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its dealers to make required payments 
the current methodology takes into consideration the dealer financing arrangement  where payment on motorhomes is pre approved prior to shipment with payment made directly from the dealer s third party finance source to the company within business days from the date of shipment 
this arrangement significantly reduces the risk of loss from the sale of motorhomes 
parts receivables represent a minimal portion of the total accounts receivable 
the company uses a specific reserve methodology and currently reserves of invoices greater than days old 
additionally  the company reviews all other accounts for collectibility and those not considered collectible are reserved for as deemed appropriate 
there is no expectation that this methodology will change in the near term  however  to the extent any of the assumptions should change in the future  the company will reassess the methodology and make any necessary adjustments 
restatement due to correction of errors the prior period financial statements presented in this annual report on form k have been restated for three correcting adjustments 
these adjustments are discussed in more detail below
