we acquired the foss lake gathering system as part of the western oklahoma acquisition in december the system is a low pressure gathering system consisting of approximately miles of four to inch pipeline connected to approximately wells and includes approximately  horsepower of owned compression and approximately  horsepower of leased compression 
the system gathers natural gas from the anadarko basin in western oklahoma from approximately producers 
we generate revenues by charging fixed fees per mcf of natural gas gathered and through settlement margin arrangements 
all of the natural gas gathered into the system is dehydrated at our butler compression station for delivery to our arapaho processing plant 
arapaho processing plant 
we acquired the arapaho processing plant  located in custer county  oklahoma  as part of the western oklahoma acquisition in december our arapaho gas processing plant is a cryogenic plant completed in early the plant is designed to recover ethane and heavier ngls  including propane 
the plant can also reject ethane and continue to recover high levels of propane 
the plant delivers processed natural gas into the panhandle eastern pipe line pepl and recovered ngls are sold into the conway  kansas ngl market via a pipeline system owned by a third party 
we generate revenues through keep whole contracts 
under these keep whole arrangements  we process the natural gas and sell the resulting ngls to third parties at market prices 
because the extraction of the ngls from the natural gas stream during processing reduces the btu content of the natural gas  we must either purchase natural gas at market prices for return to producers or make a cash payment to the producers 
accordingly  under these arrangements our revenues and gross margins increase as the price of ngls increases relative to the price of natural gas  and our revenues and gross margins decrease as the price of natural gas increases relative to the price of ngls 
in the latter case  however  we have the option of not operating the plant in a low processing margin environment because the btu content of the inlet natural gas meets the pepl btu specification 
approximately of the foss lake gas gathering contracts include additional fees to cover plant operating costs  fuel costs and shrinkage costs in a low processing margin environment 
because of our ability to operate the plant in several recovery modes  or to turn it off  as well as the additional fees provided for in the gas gathering contracts  our exposure is limited to a portion of the operating costs of the plant

we acquired the appleby gathering system as part of the pinnacle acquisition in march the system is a low pressure gathering system consisting of approximately miles of three to eight inch pipeline connected to approximately wells and includes approximately  horsepower of leased compression and  horsepower of owned compression 
the system gathers natural gas from the travis peak basin in texas from approximately seven producers  with one producer accounting for approximately of the volumes 
we sell the gas to marketing companies and to an industrial user under short term marketing contracts 
we generate a majority of our operating margin through percent of index contracts with the remaining margin generated through fee based contracts  which are described in more detail under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our contracts 
other gathering systems 
as part of the pinnacle acquisition  we acquired other natural gas gathering systems  primarily located in texas  one of which was disposed of in december for an insignificant amount and two of which have been subsequently sold in for proceeds of approximately million 
the systems typically gather natural gas from mature producing wells 
we generate revenues from these systems through percent of index  percent of proceeds and fixed fee contracts  which are described in more detail under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our contracts 
lateral pipelines 
we acquired the lake whitney lateral  the rio nogales lateral and the blackhawk lateral as part of the pinnacle acquisition in march we acquired our lubbock lateral in september and our hobbs lateral in april the lubbock and hobbs lateral pipelines are the only laterals we own that produce revenue on a per unit of throughput basis 
the other lateral pipelines operate on a fixed fee contract basis  under which our customer pays us a fixed monthly fee for the dedicated volume on that pipeline  independent of the volume of gas we transport 
the lake whitney lateral  constructed in  is a mile intrastate natural gas pipeline that transports natural gas to a third party s megawatt bosque power plant  located near waco  texas 
the lateral transports natural gas from the el paso field services pipeline and is the only pipeline connected to  and the sole source of natural gas for  the bosque power plant

in  we began construction of a new mmcf d processing plant 
this new plant replaces our existing cobb plant 
it was completed in the first quarter of the kermit processing plant is operated by a third party producer and we do not receive inlet volume information 
kenova processing plant 
our kenova cryogenic facility was expanded by mmcf d in to accommodate expected new production from a third party producer 
the cryogenic process utilizes a turbo expander and heat exchangers to cool the gas  which condenses the ngls 
the ngls are then separated from condensed gaseous components by distillation 
this facility receives all of its intake of natural gas from columbia gas transmission pipeline and processes gas from adjoining counties 
ngls extracted at this facility are transported to our siloam fractionator via pipeline 
boldman processing plant 
our boldman straight refrigeration processing plant processes gas using a propane refrigeration system to cool the gas and condense the ngls 
the ngls are then separated from condensed gaseous components by distillation 
this facility receives all of its intake of natural gas from columbia gas transmission pipelines and processes gas produced in pike  floyd  letcher and knott counties  kentucky 
ngls extracted at this facility are first delivered by truck to our maytown facility and transported via pipeline to our siloam fractionator 
maytown processing plant 
pursuant to contract  a third party producer provides certain operating services at our maytown facility  a straight refrigeration plant  on our behalf 
while providing operating services  this third party is responsible for the day to day operation of the maytown plant 
under our gas processing agreement with this third party  we have the right to assume the role of operator upon providing them with a day written notice 
like the boldman plant  the maytown plant also processes gas using a propane refrigeration system to cool the gas and condense the ngls 
the ngls are then separated from condensed gaseous components by distillation 
this facility receives all of its intake of natural gas from the third party s gathering system in kentucky 
ngls extracted at this facility are transported to siloam via pipeline 
the plant also contains a truck unloading facility that allows for the delivery of ngls into our pipeline system for transportation to our siloam fractionator 
cobb processing plant 
our cobb facility  a refrigerated lean oil processing plant  was acquired in the refrigerated lean oil process utilizes a propane refrigeration system to cool the gas and the lean oil 
the chilled lean oil absorbs the ngls  which are then separated from the lean oil by distillation 
this facility receives its entire intake of natural gas from columbia gas transmission lines and processes gas produced in kanawha  clay  roane and jackson counties  west virginia 
ngls extracted at this facility are transported to our siloam facility by tanker truck 
during  we began replacing our existing cobb facility with a newly constructed mmcf d processing plant 
we completed the new processing plant in the first quarter of kermit processing plant 
our kermit facility  a straight refrigeration plant  was constructed in connection with the expansion at our kenova facility and in anticipation of increased demand for our services 
this facility was designed and constructed to increase the volume of natural gas transported to our kenova facility by decreasing the liquid content of the natural gas in a third party s transmission lines 
the kermit plant processes gas using the same straight refrigeration process used at our boldman plant 
ngls extracted at this facility are transported to our siloam facility via tanker truck 
appalachian ngl pipelines our appalachia liquids pipeline includes the following segments design year ended december  throughput ngl utilization of year capacity throughput design pipeline location miles constructed gal day gal day capacity maytown to institute floyd county  ky to kanawha county  wv ranger to kenova lincoln county  wv to wayne county  wv kenova to siloam wayne county  wv to south shore  ky includes miles of currently unused pipeline extending from ranger to institute 
ngls transported through the ranger to kenova pipeline are included in the kenova to siloam volumes 
we earn fees for transporting the ngls recovered from the kenova  maytown  and boldman plants to siloam via our appalachian pipeline 
prior to  we owned and operated the line between kenova and siloam 
this pipeline system was expanded in by leasing from a third party the mile segment from maytown to ranger to institute and purchasing the mile segment from ranger to kenova and the mile segment from kenova to siloam 
these segments provide a contiguous pipeline system from our maytown plant to kenova and kenova to siloam 
the segment from ranger to institute is not required for the ngl pipeline operation and is currently idle 
ngls extracted from our maytown and kenova plants are injected directly into this pipeline system and transported to our siloam fractionator 
ngls extracted from our boldman plant are trucked to the maytown plant and transported via the ngl pipeline to siloam 
in november of  a failure and ensuing explosion and fire occurred on the section of leased pipeline from maytown to ranger 
the office of pipeline safety ops issued an order requiring among other things  hydrostatic testing of the line prior to its return to service 
until the pipeline is returned to service  maytown and boldman ngls are being trucked to siloam for fractionation resulting in an increase to our ngl transportation costs 
the partnership has submitted claims for and is pursuing business interruption insurance to cover the increased transportation costs incurred and lost income due to the pipeline being out of service as a result of the fire and explosion and ops order 
from november through december   our interruption loss was estimated to be approximately million 
we expect to incur these additional costs until the pipeline is returned to service 
appalachian fractionation facility our siloam fractionation plant receives substantially all of its ngls via pipeline or tanker truck from our five appalachia processing plants  with the balance received from tanker truck and rail car deliveries from other third party ngl sources 
the ngls are then separated into ngl products  including propane  isobutane  normal butane and natural gasoline 
the typical composition of the ngl throughput in our appalachian operations has been approximately propane  normal butane  isobutane and natural gasoline 
we do not currently produce or sell any ethane

you should read agreements with markwest hydrocarbon included in item of this form k for a more complete description of the contracts we have entered into with markwest hydrocarbon 
competition we face competition for natural gas and crude oil transportation and in obtaining natural gas supplies for our processing and related services operations  in obtaining unprocessed ngls for fractionation  and in marketing our products and services 
competition for natural gas supplies is based primarily on the location of gas gathering facilities and gas processing plants  operating efficiency and reliability  and ability to obtain a satisfactory price for products recovered 
competitive factors affecting our fractionation services include availability of capacity  proximity to supply and to industry marketing centers  and cost efficiency and reliability of service 
competition for customers is based primarily on price  delivery capabilities  flexibility  and maintenance of quality customer relationships 
in competing for new business opportunities  we face strong competition in acquiring natural gas and crude oil supplies and in competing for service fees 
our competitors include major integrated oil companies  medium and large sized independent e p companies  major interstate and intrastate pipelines  other large natural gas gatherers that gather  process and market natural gas and ngls  and a relatively large number of smaller gas gatherers of varying financial resources and experience 
many of our competitors operate as master limited partnerships and enjoy a cost of capital comparable  and in some cases lower  than ours 
other competitors  such as major oil and gas and pipeline companies  have capital resources and control supplies of natural gas substantially greater than ours 
smaller local distributors may enjoy a marketing advantage in their immediate service areas 
title to properties substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rights of way granted by the apparent record owners of the property 
lands over which pipeline rights of way have been obtained may be subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the right of way grants 
we have obtained  where necessary  easement agreements from public authorities and railroad companies to cross over or under  or to lay facilities in or along  watercourses  county roads  municipal streets  railroad properties and state highways  as applicable 
many of these permits are revocable at the election of the grantor 
in some cases  property on which our pipelines were built was purchased in fee 
our siloam fractionation plant and kenova processing plant are on land that we own in fee 
some of the leases  easements  rights of way  permits  licenses and franchise ordinances that were transferred to us required the consent of the then current landowner to transfer these rights  which in some instances was a governmental entity 
our general partner believes that it has obtained sufficient third party consents  permits and authorizations for the transfer of the assets necessary for us to operate our business in all material respects 
our general partner believes that we have satisfactory title to all of our assets 
to the extent certain defects in title to the assets contributed to us or failures to obtain certain consents and permits necessary to conduct our business arise within three years after the closing of our initial public offering  we are entitled to indemnification from markwest hydrocarbon under the omnibus agreement 
title to property may be subject to encumbrances 
our general partner does not believe that any of these encumbrances materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest in these properties or should materially interfere with their use in the operation of our business 
the partnership has pledged substantially all of our assets to secure the debt of our subsidiary markwest energy operating company  llc the operating company as discussed in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated and combined financial statements included in item of this form k 
regulatory matters our activities are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations  as well as orders of regulatory bodies  governing a wide variety of matters  including marketing  production  pricing  community right to know  protection of the environment  safety and other matters 
some of our gas  liquids and crude oil gathering and transmission operations are subject to regulation by various regulatory bodies 
in many cases  various phases of our gas  liquids and crude oil operations in the states in which we operate are subject to rate and service regulation 
applicable statutes generally require that our rates and terms and conditions of service provide no more than a fair return on the aggregate value of the facilities used to render services 
our appalachian pipeline carries ngls across state lines 
the primary shipper on the pipeline is markwest hydrocarbon  who has entered into agreements with us providing for a fixed transportation charge for the term of the agreements  which expire on december  we are the only other shipper on the pipeline 
as we do not operate our appalachian pipeline as a common carrier and do not hold the pipeline out for service to the public generally  there are currently no third party shippers on this pipeline and the pipeline is and will continue to be operated as a proprietary facility and consequently should not be subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission  ferc 
however  we cannot provide assurance that ferc would not determine that such transportation is within its jurisdiction 
in such a case  we would be required to file a tariff for such transportation with the ferc and provide a cost justification for the transportation charge 
markwest hydrocarbon has agreed to not challenge the status of our appalachian pipeline or the transportation charge during the term of our agreements with markwest hydrocarbon 
moreover  the likelihood of other entities seeking to utilize our appalachian pipeline is remote 
however  we cannot predict whether an assertion of ferc jurisdiction might be made with respect to this pipeline  nor provide assurance that such an assertion would not adversely affect our results of operations 
with respect to the michigan crude pipeline  one shipper recently contacted ferc to inquire about a transportation rate increase and the pipeline s regulatory rate structure 
in response  ferc requested that we contact the shipper to initiate a discussion regarding the shipper s questions 
we are presently in discussions with all shippers regarding rate structures and are attempting to resolve any issues they may have 
ferc also requested that we file a tariff 
while the michigan crude pipeline operations are entirely within the state of michigan and have been regulated by the state of michigan  we have calculated and determined that our current and proposed rate structures are well below rates that would be allowed under ferc s cost of service rate making structure 
however  we cannot predict whether a ferc jurisdictional challenge might be made with respect to the michigan crude pipeline  nor provide assurance that such a development would not adversely affect our results of operations 
some of our liquids and crude oil gathering facilities deliver into pipelines that have the ability to make redeliveries in both interstate and intrastate commerce 
the rates we charge on our liquids and crude oil facilities are not regulated at the state or federal level  however  there can be no assurance that the rates for service on these facilities will remain unregulated in the future 
safety regulation 
our pipelines are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation under the hazardous liquid pipeline safety act hlpsa  as amended relating to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of pipeline facilities 
the hlpsa covers crude oil  carbon dioxide  ngl and petroleum products pipelines and requires any entity which owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with the regulations under the hlpsa  to permit access to and allow copying of records and to make certain reports and provide information as required by the secretary of transportation 
we believe that our pipeline operations are in substantial compliance with applicable hlpsa requirements  however  due to the possibility of new or amended laws and regulations or reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that future compliance efforts associated with the hlpsa will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 
the pipeline safety improvement act of includes numerous provisions that tighten federal specifications and safety requirements for natural gas and hazardous liquids pipeline facilities 
many of the statute s provisions build on existing statutory requirements and strengthen regulations of the research and special programs administration and the us department of transportation office of pipeline safety ops  in particular  with respect to operator qualifications programs  natural mapping system and safe excavation practices 
management of the partnership believes that compliance efforts associated with the pipeline safety improvement act of will not have a material effect on its operations 
on november   a leak and release of vapors occurred in a pipeline transporting ngls from the maytown gas processing plant to our siloam fractionator 
this pipeline is owned by a third party  and leased and operated by our subsidiary  markwest energy appalachia  llc 
a subsequent ignition and fire from the leaked vapors resulted in property damage to five homes and injuries to some of the residents 
the exact cause of the leak and resulting fire is unknown and is being investigated by the ops  the owner and us 
pursuant to a corrective action order issued by the ops on november  and amended november   pipeline and valve integrity evaluation  testing and repair efforts are required and are being conducted on the affected pipeline segment before service can be resumed 
both the pipeline owner and we are working with ops to assure compliance with the order

our processing and fractionization plants  pipelines and associated facilities in connection with the gathering and processing of natural gas  the transportation  fractionation and storage of ngls and the storage and gathering and transportation of crude oil are subject to multiple environmental obligations and potential liabilities under a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations  including without limitation  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the federal water pollution control act or the clean water act  the oil pollution act  and analogous state and local laws and regulations 
such laws and regulations affect many aspects of our present and future operations and generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations  licenses  permits  inspections and other approvals  with respect to air emissions  water quality  wastewater discharges  solid and hazardous waste management 
failure to comply with these laws  regulations  permits and licenses may expose us to fines  penalties and or interruptions in our operations that could be material to our results of operations 
if an accidental leak  spill or release of hazardous substances occurs from our lines or facilities  in the process of transporting natural gas  or at any facilities that we own  operate or otherwise use  or where we send materials for treatment or disposal  we could be held jointly and severally liable for all resulting liabilities  including investigation  remedial and clean up costs 
likewise  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination  including groundwater contamination or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination for properties owned  leased or acquired by us which may have been previously operated by third parties and who may have released or disposed of hazardous substances or wastes  all of which could materially affect our results of operations and cash flows 
nevertheless  we believe that our operations and facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
however  we cannot ensure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us 
the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment  and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation  and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate 
revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions  particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers  could have material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
ongoing remediation and indemnification from a third party 
the previous owner operator of our boldman and cobb facilities has been or is currently involved in investigatory or remedial activities with respect to the real property underlying these facilities pursuant to an administrative order by consent for removal actions with epa regions ii  iii  iv  and v in september and an agreed order entered into with the kentucky natural resources and environmental protection cabinet in october the previous owner operator has agreed to retain sole liability and responsibility for  and indemnify markwest hydrocarbon against  any environmental liabilities associated with the epa administrative order  the kentucky agreed order or any other environmental condition related to the real property prior to the effective dates of markwest hydrocarbon s agreements pursuant to which markwest hydrocarbon leased or purchased the real property 
in addition  the previous owner operator has agreed to perform all the required response actions at its cost and expense in a manner that minimizes interference with markwest hydrocarbon s use of the properties 
on may   markwest hydrocarbon assigned to us the benefit of this indemnity from the previous owner operator 
to date  the previous owner operator has been performing all actions required under these agreements  and  accordingly  we do not believe that the remediation obligation of these properties will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
employee safety the workplaces associated with the processing and storage facilities and the pipelines we operate are also subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act  osha  and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local government authorities  and citizens 
we believe that we have conducted our operations in substantial compliance with osha requirements  including general industry standards  record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances 
in general  we expect industry and regulatory safety standards to become stricter over time  thereby resulting in increased compliance expenditures 
while these expenditures cannot be accurately estimated at this time  we do not expect such expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
employees we do not have any employees 
to carry out our operations  our general partner or its affiliates employ approximately individuals who operate our facilities and provide general and administrative services as our agents 
the paper  allied industrial  chemical and energy workers international union local represents employees at our siloam fractionation facility in south shore  kentucky 
the collective bargaining agreement with this union expired on june   markwest hydrocarbon is currently negotiating a new contract with the union 
the agreement covers only hourly  non supervisory employees

item legal proceedings markwest energy partners  in the ordinary course of business  is a defendant in various lawsuits and a party to various other legal proceedings  some of which are covered in whole or in part by insurance 
in the opinion of management  none of these actions  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations

markwest hydrocarbon  inc et al  floyd circuit court  commonwealth of kentucky  civil action no 
ci  filed february  these actions seek recovery of property or personal injury damages sustained as a result of a leak and ensuing explosion and fire occurring november  in a ngls line owned by a third party and leased and operated by our subsidiary  markwest energy appalachia  llc 
the four inch pipeline transported ngls from the maytown gas processing plant to our siloam fractionator 
the ensuing ignition and fire from the leaked vapors resulted in property damage to five homes and injuries to some of the residents 
the exact cause of the leak  explosion and resulting fire is unknown and is being investigated by the ops  the pipeline owner and us 
pursuant to a corrective action order issued by the ops  pipeline and valve integrity evaluation  testing and repair efforts are required and are being conducted on the affected pipeline segment before service can be resumed 
until repairs are completed and service is resumed on the line  ngls from our boldman and maytown plants will be trucked directly to the siloam fractionator  resulting in an increase in our ngl transportation costs 
the partnership has submitted claims for and is pursuing business interruption insurance to cover the increased transportation costs incurred and lost income 
while investigation into the incident continues  at this time we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for property damage and personal injury liability  resulting from the incident 
the deductible for the insurance is million  which has been accrued for as a charge to operations in item submission of matters to a vote of security holders no matter was submitted to a vote of the holders of our common units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended december  part ii item market for registrant s common units and related unitholder matters our common units have been listed on the american stock exchange amex under the symbol mwe since may  prior to may   our equity securities were not listed on any exchange or traded on any public trading market

the partnership has also issued  subordinated units  for which there is no established public trading market 
there were approximately holders of record of our subordinated units 
distributions of available cash the partnership distributes of its available cash within days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record and to the general partner 
available cash is defined in our partnership agreement and generally consists of all cash and cash equivalents of the partnership on hand at the end of each quarter less reserves established by the general partner for future requirements plus all cash on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter resulting from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter 
the general partner has the discretion to establish cash reserves that are necessary or appropriate to i provide for the proper conduct of our business  ii comply with applicable law  any of our debt instruments or other agreements  or iii provide funds for distributions to unitholders and the general partner for any one or more of the next four quarters 
distributions of available cash during the subordination period during the subordination period as defined in the partnership agreement and discussed further below  our quarterly distributions of available cash will be made in the following manner first  to the common unitholders and to our general partner  until each common unitholder has received a minimum quarterly distribution of plus any arrearages from prior quarters 
second  to the subordinated unitholders and to our general partner  until each subordinated unitholder has received a minimum quarterly distribution of plus any arrearages from prior quarters 
third  to all unitholders  pro rata  and to our general partner  until each unitholder has received a distribution of per quarter 
thereafter  in the manner described in incentive distribution rights below 
distributions of available cash after the subordination period we will make distributions of available cash for any quarter after the subordination period in the following manner first  to all unitholders  pro rata  and to our general partner until we distribute for each outstanding unit an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution for that quarter  and thereafter  in the manner described in incentive distribution rights below 
incentive distribution rights incentive distribution rights represent the right to receive an increasing percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash after the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels  as described below  have been achieved 
our general partner currently holds the incentive distribution rights  but may transfer these rights separately from its general partner interest  subject to restrictions in the partnership agreement 
if for any quarter we have distributed available cash to the common and subordinated unitholders in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution  and we have distributed available cash on outstanding common units in an amount necessary to eliminate any cumulative arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution  then  we will distribute any additional available cash for that quarter among the unitholders and our general partner in the following manner first  to all unitholders  pro rata  and to our general partner until each unitholder receives a total of per unit for that quarter the first target distribution  second  to all unitholders  pro rata  and to our general partner  until each unitholder receives a total of per unit for that quarter the second target distribution  third  to all unitholders  pro rata  and to our general partner  until each unitholder receives a total of per unit for that quarter the third target distribution  and thereafter  to all unitholders  pro rata  and to our general partner 
in each case  the amount of the target distribution set forth above is exclusive of any distributions to common unitholders to eliminate any cumulative arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution 
we are presently distributing in excess of per unit per quarter 
there is no guarantee that we will pay the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units in any quarter  and we will be prohibited from making any distributions to unitholders if it would cause an event of default under our credit facility 
the subordination period generally will not end earlier than june  however  a portion of the subordinated units may be converted into common units at an earlier date on a one for one basis based upon the achievement of certain financial goals defined in the partnership agreement 
as a result of achieving those goals in may   subordinated units will convert into common units on june  an additional  of the outstanding subordinated units will also convert into common units on september  the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes contains restrictions on our ability to make cash distributions 
under the indenture  we are restricted from making distributions a restricted payment if at the time of making the restricted payment  a default or an event of default has occurred and is continuing 
the partnership s failure to file this annual report on form k for year ended december  and its quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission s rules and regulations constituted a default under the indenture and the failure to file the form k within thirty days after the april  notice from the indenture trustee constituted an event of default under the indenture 
on may   the partnership paid a cash distribution to unitholders for the first quarter of this cash distribution  made while the event of default for failure to file its form k had occurred and was continuing  constituted a default under the indenture  and this default matured into an event of default thirty days after such restricted payment was made  or june  both of these events of default are cured through the filing of this form k and the quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of prior to any declaration of acceleration of the senior notes by the trustee as a result of such events of default 
in addition  as the partnership was unable to deliver its audited consolidated financial statements within days of december   the partnership is not in compliance with its debt covenants for the credit facility 
the lending institutions of our credit facility have waived the days delivery requirement until june  item selected financial data on may   the partnership completed its initial public offering and thereafter the partnership became the successor to the business of the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business midstream business 
the selected financial information for the partnership was derived from the audited consolidated and combined financial statements as of and for the years ended december   and the selected historical financial information of the midstream business as of and for the years ended december  and are derived from the audited combined financial statements of the midstream business 
the selected financial data should be read in conjunction with the combined and consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
on may   management  after discussion with the audit committee of our board of directors  determined that previously issued financial statements for the years ended december  and and for each of the first three quarters of and should be restated to reflect compensation expense allocated to us attributable to the sale of subordinated partnership units and interests in the partnership s general partner to certain employees and directors of markwest hydrocarbon that occurred during  and the partnership has also restated revenue for by million to record natural gas inventory at cost

we receive a flat fee from our other lateral pipelines and  consequently  the throughput data from these lateral pipelines is excluded from this statistic 
includes throughput from our kenova  cobb  and boldman processing plants 
we acquired our michigan crude pipeline in december item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a delaware limited partnership formed by markwest hydrocarbon on january  to acquire most of the assets  liabilities and operations of the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business 
since our initial public offering in may of  we have significantly expanded our operations through a series of acquisitions 
we are engaged in the gathering  processing and transmission of natural gas  the transportation  fractionation and storage of ngl products and the gathering and transportation of crude oil 
to better understand our business and the results of operations discussed below  it is important to have an understanding of three factors the nature of the contracts from which we derive our revenues  the difficulty in comparing our results of operations across periods  both because of our recent acquisition activity  and the nature of our relationship with markwest hydrocarbon 
our contracts we generate the majority of our revenues and gross margin from natural gas gathering  processing and transmission  ngl transportation  fractionation and storage  and crude oil gathering and transportation 
in our current areas of operations  we have a variety of contract types 
in many cases  we provide services under contracts that contain a combination of more than one of the arrangements described below 
while all of these services constitute midstream energy operations  we provide services under the following five types of contracts fee based contracts 
under fee based contracts  we receive a fee or fees for one or more of the following services gathering  processing and transmission of natural gas  transportation  fractionation and storage of ngls  and gathering and transportation of crude oil 
the revenue we earn from these contracts is directly related to the volume of natural gas  ngls or crude oil that flows through our systems and facilities and is not directly dependent on commodity prices 
in certain cases  our contracts provide for minimum annual payments 
to the extent a sustained decline in commodity prices results in a decline in volumes  however  our revenues from these contracts would be reduced 
percent of proceeds contracts 
under percent of proceeds contracts  we generally gather and process natural gas on behalf of producers  sell the resulting residue gas and ngls at market prices and remit to producers an agreed upon percentage of the proceeds based on an index price 
in other cases  instead of remitting cash payments to the producer  we deliver an agreed upon percentage of the residue gas and ngls to the producer and sell the volumes we keep to third parties at market prices 
under these types of contracts  our revenues and gross margins increase as natural gas prices and ngl prices increase  and our revenues and gross margins decrease as natural gas prices and ngl prices decrease 
percent of index contracts 
under percent of index contracts  we generally purchase natural gas at either a percentage discount to a specified index price  a specified index price less a fixed amount or a percentage discount to a specified index price less an additional fixed amount 
we then gather and deliver the natural gas to pipelines where we resell the natural gas at the index price  or at a different percentage discount to the index price 
with respect to and above  the gross margins we realize under the arrangements decrease in periods of low natural gas prices because these gross margins are based on a percentage of the index price 
conversely  our gross margins increase during periods of rising natural gas prices 
keep whole contracts 
under keep whole contracts  we gather natural gas from the producer  process the natural gas and sell the resulting ngls to third parties at market prices 
because the extraction of the ngls from the natural gas during processing reduces the btu content of the natural gas  we must either purchase natural gas at market prices for return to producers or make a cash payment to the producers equal to the energy content of this natural gas 
accordingly  under these arrangements  our revenues and gross margins increase as the price of ngls increases relative to the price of natural gas  and our revenues and gross margins decrease as the price of natural gas increases relative to the price of ngls 
east texas system gathering arrangements 
we gather volumes on the east texas system under contracts with fee arrangements that are unique to that system 
these contracts typically contain one or more of the following revenue components fixed gathering and compression fees 
typically  gathering and compression fees are comprised of a fixed fee portion in which producers pay a fixed rate per unit to transport their natural gas through the gathering system 
under the majority of these arrangements  fees are adjusted annually based on the consumer price index 
settlement margin 
typically  the terms of our east texas system gathering arrangements specify that we are allowed to retain a fixed percentage of the volume gathered to cover the compression fuel charges and deemed line losses 
to the extent the east texas system is operated more efficiently than specified per contract allowance  we are entitled to retain the difference for our own account 
condensate sales 
during the gathering process  thermodynamic forces contribute to changes in operating conditions of the natural gas flowing through the pipeline infrastructure 
as a result  hydrocarbon dew points are reached  causing condensation of hydrocarbons in the high pressure pipelines 
the east texas system sells the condensate collected in the system at a monthly crude oil index based price 
in our current areas of operations  we have a combination of contract types and limited keep whole arrangements 
in many cases  we provide services under contracts that contain a combination of more than one of the arrangements described above 
the terms of our contracts vary based on gas quality conditions  the competitive environment at the time the contracts are signed and customer requirements 
our contract mix and  accordingly  our exposure to natural gas and ngl prices  may change as a result of changes in producer preferences  our expansion in regions where some types of contracts are more common and other market factors 
any change in mix will impact our financial results 
at december   our primary exposure to keep whole contracts was limited to our arapaho oklahoma processing plant and our east texas processing contracts 
at the arapaho plant inlet  the btu content of the natural gas meets the downstream pipeline specifications  however  we have the option of extracting ngls when the processing margin environment is favorable 
in addition  approximately half  as measured in volumes  of the related gas gathering contracts include additional fees to cover plant operating costs  fuel costs and shrinkage costs in a low processing margin environment 
because of our ability to operate the plant in several recovery modes  including turning it off  coupled with the additional fees provided for in the gas gathering contracts  our overall keep whole contract exposure is limited to a portion of the operating costs of the plant 
in east texas approximately of the inlet volumes are processed pursuant to keep whole contracts 
for the year ended december   we generated the following percentages of our revenue and gross margin from the following types of contracts fee based percent of proceeds percent of index keep whole total revenue gross margin includes other types of contracts tied to ngl prices 
includes other types of contracts tied to natural gas prices 
includes other types of contracts tied to both ngl and natural gas prices 
impact of recent acquisitions on comparability of financial results in reading the discussion of our historical results of operations  you should be aware of the impact of our recent acquisitions 
since our initial public offering  we have completed six acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of million 
these six acquisitions include the pinnacle acquisition  which closed on march   for consideration of million  the lubbock pipeline acquisition also known as the power tex lateral pipeline  which closed september   for consideration of million  the western oklahoma acquisition  which closed december   for consideration of million  the michigan crude pipeline acquisition  which closed december   for consideration of million  the hobbs acquisition  which closed april   for consideration of million  and the east texas acquisition  which closed on july   for consideration of million 
our historical results of operations for the year ended december   do not reflect the impact of these acquisitions on our operations for the full year 
our results of operations for the year ended december   reflect the impact of our four acquisitions  as well as nine months of operations for our hobbs lateral acquisition and five months of results from our east texas system acquisition 
our relationship with markwest hydrocarbon  inc our financial statements for the year ended december  reflect  in part  the results of the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business on a historical cost basis for the period from january  through may  combined with our results for the period from may   the date of our initial public offering  through december  our results prior to may  include charges from markwest hydrocarbon for direct costs and allocations of indirect corporate overhead and the results of contracts in force at the time 
the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business predominantly consisted of the markwest hydrocarbon appalachian operations 
our results of operations after our initial public offering changed substantially  primarily as a result of the contracts we entered into in connection with our initial public offering 
these differences are primarily driven by the way in which we generate revenues in contrast to the way in which the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business generated revenues 
historically  the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business generated its revenues pursuant to keep whole and percent of proceeds contracts 
upon the formation of the partnership  markwest hydrocarbon retained these contracts and subcontracted the services to the partnership under fee based arrangements 
by entering into these fee based contracts with markwest hydrocarbon  the partnership was able to reduce the commodity price volatility from the revenue generated from these assets  which significantly impacted our financial statements before and after the date of our initial public offering 
the major difference between the financial statements of the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business and our financial statements is in revenues and purchased product costs 
generally  revenues and purchased product costs in the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business s financial statements are higher because the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business revenues included the aggregate sales price for all the ngl products produced in its operations  and the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business s purchased product costs included the cost of natural gas purchases needed to replace the btu content of the ngls extracted in its processing operations and the percentage of the proceeds from the sale of ngl products remitted to producers under percent of proceeds contracts 
in contrast  after entering into the new contractual arrangements  our revenues related to these assets include just the fees we receive for processing natural gas  transporting  fractionating and storing ngls and the aggregate proceeds from ngl sales we receive under our percent of proceeds contracts  and our purchased product costs related to these assets primarily consist of the percentage of proceeds from the sale of ngl products remitted to producers under these contracts  along with a small portion of costs attributable to natural gas purchases to satisfy our obligations under our keep whole contracts 
our facility expenses  similar to the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business  principally consist of those expenses required to operate our facilities  including applicable personnel costs  fuel  plant utility costs and maintenance expenses 
however  markwest hydrocarbon continues to incur the producer plant fuel reimbursement obligations  as was the case prior to the partnership s formation 
under a services agreement  we reimburse markwest hydrocarbon monthly for the general and administrative support provided to us in the prior month 
restatement of financial statements we have determined that  in certain cases  we did not comply with generally accepted accounting principles in the preparation of our and consolidated financial statements and  accordingly  we have restated our and annual financial statements through the filing of this form k 
the partnership has also filed form q a s for the first three quarters of to restate its quarterly financial statements for and the restatements result from an allocation of compensation expense from markwest hydrocarbon attributed to its sale of a portion of its subordinated partnership units and interests in our general partner to certain employees and directors from through markwest hydrocarbon had historically recorded the sale of the subordinated partnership units and interests in our general partner to certain of markwest hydrocarbon s employees and directors as a sale of an asset 
these arrangements are referred to as the participation plan 
however  markwest hydrocarbon determined that these transactions should be accounted for as compensatory arrangements  consistent with the guidance in apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
this guidance requires markwest hydrocarbon to record compensation expense based on the market value of the subordinated partnership units and the formula value of the general partner interests held by the employees and directors at the end of each reporting period 
the formula value is the amount markwest hydrocarbon would pay to repurchase the interests if the employee exercises its put option or if markwest hydrocarbon exercises its call option for the interests held by the employees or directors 
in the process of determining the ultimate accounting treatment for these transactions a conclusion was reached by the partnership that the compensation expense related to services provided by markwest hydrocarbon s employees and directors recognized under apb should be allocated to the partnership pursuant to topic b of the codification of the staff accounting bulletins  allocation of expenses and related disclosure in financial statements of subsidiaries  divisions or lesser business components of another entity  based on the amount of time each employee devotes to the partnership 
compensation attributable to interests that were sold to individuals who serve on both our board of directors and on the board of directors of markwest hydrocarbon is allocated equally 
the charge is a non cash item that did not affect management s determination of the partnership s distributable cash flow for any period  and did not affect net income attributed to the limited partners 
under the partnership agreement  the general partner is deemed to have made a capital contribution equal to the compensation expense recorded under the participation plan  and the compensation expense is allocated to the general partner 
as a result  there is no impact on the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition to these adjustments  we have also made an adjustment to record natural gas inventory at cost in the fourth quarter of the impact of these restatements was to reduce net income by million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in addition  the partnership has restated its financial position by reducing its originally reported assets and liabilities and equity by million at december   the major details of which are shown in note  restatement of consolidated financial statement  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k 
the information contained in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations has been changed to reflect these restatement adjustments 
all amounts reported in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are as restated  unless otherwise stated

revenues 
our revenues were higher than our revenues primarily due to our and acquisitions  which increased our revenues by million 
the increase was also due to higher appalachia ngl product sales prices and volumes  which increased revenue by million 
in addition  higher margins due to higher gas prices in the southwest  along with increased southwest processing margins from an increase in liquid prices  contributed million 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in our michigan pipeline throughput volumes  which decreased revenue by million 
purchased product costs 
purchased product costs were higher in primarily due to our late and acquisitions  which increased our purchased product costs by million 
the remainder of the increase is primarily attributable to price and volume increases for our appalachia ngl product sales 
price increases contributed million and volume increases contributed an additional million to purchased product costs 
facility expenses 
facility expenses increased approximately million during relative to the same period in primarily due to our and acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a expenses increased during the year ended december  compared to because markwest hydrocarbon was contractually limited in the amount it could charge us to million annually  from may   the date of our initial public offering  through may  in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses have increased due to increased administrative costs of million associated with our acquisitions  increased sarbanes oxley compliance related expenses and audit fees of million  an increase in bonus and severance expense of million and professional services costs of million 
in addition  the allocation of compensation expense to the partnership resulting from the sale of the subordinated partnership units and interests in the general partner to certain of markwest hydrocarbon s employees and directors from through increased sg a by million 
the charge is a non cash item that did not affect management s determination of the partnership s distributable cash flow for any period  and did not affect net income attributed to the limited partners 
depreciation 
depreciation expense increased during primarily due to our and acquisitions  which increased depreciation by approximately million 
additionally  commencing january   we accelerated the rate of depreciation of our michigan gathering pipeline and processing plant by reducing the estimated useful lives of the related assets from years to years to more closely match expected lives of contractually dedicated reserves behind our facilities 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization expense increased during primarily due to the east texas system acquisition in july on july   we completed the acquisition of american central eastern texas carthage gathering system and gas processing assets located in east texas for approximately million 
of the total purchase price  million was allocated to customer contracts  of which million was amortized during impairment 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a write off of million of costs associated with an isomerization unit taken out of service 
during the fourth quarter of  our general partner s board of directors approved a plan to replace our existing cobb extraction facility with a new facility 
consequently  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we wrote down the carrying value of the current cobb facility by million to its estimated fair value 
interest expense 
interest expense increased during relative to primarily due to increased debt levels resulting from the financing of our and acquisitions 
a significant amount of our acquisitions were financed through additional borrowings under our credit facility and the issuance of our senior notes 
amortization of deferred financing costs 
the increase in amortization of deferred financing costs in relative to is attributable to the debt re financings completed in as well as an increase in deferred financing cost as a result of the issuance of the senior notes 
during  we amortized approximately million of deferred financing costs related to debt issuance costs incurred to finance our acquisitions  of which million represented accelerated amortization due to the refinancing of our credit facility in july and again in october deferred financing costs are being amortized over the estimated term of the related obligations  which approximates the effective interest method

our revenues were higher than our revenues primarily due to our acquisitions  which increased our revenues by million  partially offset by the impact of the terms of the new contracts entered into by us with markwest hydrocarbon concurrent with the closing of our may initial public offering 
purchased product costs 
purchased product costs were higher in primarily due to our acquisitions  which increased our purchased product costs by million  partially offset by the impact of the terms of the new contracts entered into by us with markwest hydrocarbon concurrent with the closing of our may initial public offering 
facility expenses 
facility expenses increased during primarily due to our acquisitions  which added million 
increased fuel expenses in appalachia and increased throughput at our michigan operations also increased facility expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a expenses increased in principally due to increased non cash  phantom unit compensation expense  a result of an increase in our common unit price and the number of units granted and vested during  and the partnership s incremental costs associated with being a publicly traded company 
in addition  the allocation of compensation expense to the partnership resulting from the sale of subordinated partnership units and interests in the general partner to certain of markwest hydrocarbon s employees and directors from through increased sg a by million 
depreciation 
depreciation expense increased during primarily due to our acquisitions 
impairment 
during the fourth quarter of  our general partner s board of directors approved a plan to replace our existing cobb extraction facility with a new facility 
consequently  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we wrote down the carrying value of the current cobb facility to its estimated fair value 
interest expense 
interest expense increased during primarily due to an increase in our average outstanding debt 
most of our acquisitions were financed through additional borrowings under our credit facility 
amortization of deferred financing costs 
we amortized million in deferred financing costs related to the issuance of our debt in to finance our acquisitions 
the increase in amortization of deferred financing costs in relative to the same period in was due to an increase in deferred financing costs as a result of the increase in the size of our credit facility 
deferred financing costs are being amortized over the estimated term of the related obligations  which approximates the effective interest method 
income taxes 
the partnership has not been subject to income taxes since its inception on may   the date of conveyance of the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business to the partnership 
the midstream business recorded a non cash adjustment of million to eliminate deferred income tax liabilities that existed at the date of conveyance of the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business from markwest hydrocarbon to the partnership 
accordingly  the midstream business has recorded a deferred tax benefit for the year ended december   which increased net income by million 
seasonality with respect to our percent of proceeds  percent of index and keep whole contracts  which collectively accounted for approximately and of our revenues and and of our gross margin for the year ended december  and  respectively  we are dependent upon the sales prices of commodities  such as oil  natural gas and ngl products  which can fluctuate with winter weather conditions  and other changes in supply and demand 
liquidity and capital resources overview our primary source of liquidity to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures other than for larger acquisitions is cash flow from operations 
the public and institutional markets have been our principal source of capital to finance a majority of our growth including acquisitions 
during  we increased our capital through the issuance of million of additional equity and million of long term fixed rate debt 
since we have sold debt and equity in both public and private offerings in the past  we expect that these sources of capital will continue to be available to us in the future as we continue to grow and expand our operations 
however  we caution that ready access to capital on reasonable terms and the availability of desirable acquisition targets at attractive prices are subject to many uncertainties 
the partnership s objective is to maintain a capital structure with approximately equal amounts of debt and equity 
at december   we had long term debt outstanding of million 
total partners capital at that date was million  which resulted in a long term debt to total capital ratio of 
equity during january  we completed a secondary public offering of  common units  at per unit for gross proceeds of million 
in addition  of the  common units available to underwriters to cover over allotments   were sold for gross proceeds of million 
to maintain its interest  the general partner of the partnership contributed million 
total gross proceeds were million less associated offering costs of million  netting us approximately million 
as approximately million of the offering costs had been incurred during fiscal  net cash generated from the offering during was approximately million 
the funds were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility 
during july  we completed a private placement of  common units  at per unit for gross proceeds of million 
to maintain its interest  the general partner of the partnership contributed million 
total gross proceeds were million less associated offering costs of million netting us approximately million  which were used to finance our east texas system acquisition 
on september   we completed a secondary public offering of  common units at per unit for gross proceeds of million and  common units were sold by certain selling unitholders 
of the  common units sold by us   common units were sold pursuant to the underwriter s over allotment option 
we did not receive any proceeds from the common units sold by the selling unitholders 
our total net proceeds from the offering  after deducting transaction costs of million and including our general partner s capital contribution of million to maintain its interest  were million  which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our amended and restated credit facility 
the inability of the partnership to file its annual report on form k for the year ended december  and its quarterly report on form q for the quarter ending march  on time may impact the timing of the partnership s efforts to raise equity in the future 
we will no longer have the ability to incorporate by reference information from our filings into a new registration statement for one year following the later of the filing of this form k  and the form q for the quarter ending march  should the partnership choose to raise capital through a public offering registered on form s if the partnership raises additional capital through public debt or equity offerings  the partnership will be required to file a form s registration statement  which is a long form type of registration statement 
the requirement to file a form s registration statement may effect our ability to access the capital markets on a timely basis and will increase the costs of doing so 
the partnership has the ability to issue an unlimited number of units to fund immediately accretive acquisitions 
under the provisions of the partnership agreement an immediately accretive acquisition is one that in the general partner s good faith determination would have  if acquired by the partnership as of the date that is one year prior to the first day of the quarter in which such acquisition is consummated  resulted in an increase to the amount of operating surplus generated by the partnership on a per unit basis for all outstanding units with respect to each of the four most recently completed quarters on a pro forma basis as compared to the actual amount of operating surplus generated by the partnership on a per unit basis for all outstanding units  excluding operating surplus attributable to the acquisition with respect to each of such four most recently completed quarters 
during and  the partnership consummated six acquisitions aggregating approximately million that were partially funded by equity and debt offerings 
for acquisitions that are not immediately accretive  the partnership has the ability to issue up to  common units without unitholder approval 
debt credit facility 
the operating company amended and restated its credit facility in july  increasing the maximum lending limit from million to million 
the proceeds from the secondary public offering and borrowings under the credit facility were used to finance the east texas system acquisition 
the credit facility included a million revolving facility and a million term loan facility 
the term loan portion of the amended and restated credit facility was scheduled to mature in december and the revolving portion was scheduled to mature in may on october   the credit facility was  once again  amended and restated decreasing the maximum lending limit from million to million and increasing the term of the facility to five years 
the credit facility includes a revolving facility up to million subject to the restrictive covenants discussed below with the potential to increase the maximum lending limit to million 
the credit facility is guaranteed by the partnership and all of our present and future subsidiaries and is collateralized by substantially all of our existing and future assets and those of our subsidiaries  including stock and other equity interests 
at the partnership s option  the borrowing under the credit facility bears interest at a variable interest rate based on either i libor plus an applicable margin  which is fixed at a rate of for the first two quarters following the closing of the credit facility or ii base rate as defined for any day  a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the higher of a the federal funds rate plus of or b the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by the administrative agent of the debt as its prime rate plus an applicable margin  which is fixed at a rate of for the first two quarters following the closing of the credit facility 
after that period  the applicable margin adjusts quarterly based on our ratio of funded debt to ebitda as defined in the agreement 
for the years ended december   the weighted average interest rate was 
in connection with the credit facility  we are subject to a number of restrictions on our business  including restrictions on our ability to grant liens on assets  merge  consolidate or sell assets  incur indebtedness other than subordinated indebtedness  make acquisitions  engage in other businesses  enter into capital or operating leases  engage in transactions with affiliates  make distributions on equity interests and other usual and customary covenants 
in addition  we are subject to certain financial maintenance covenants  including our ratios of total debt to ebitda  total senior secured debt to ebitda  ebitda to interest and a minimum net worth requirement 
failure to comply with the provisions of any of these covenants could result in acceleration of our debt and other financial obligations 
there was no debt outstanding under the facility at december  and  based on the covenants below  we had available borrowing capacity of approximately million 
the covenants are used to calculate the available borrowing capacity on a quarterly basis 
the credit facility contains covenants requiring the partnership to maintain a ratio of not less than to of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense for the prior four fiscal quarters  a ratio of not more than to of total consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda for the prior four fiscal quarters  a minimum net worth of million plus of proceeds of equity issued subsequent to october   and a ratio of not more than to of consolidated senior debt to consolidated ebitda for the prior four fiscal quarters 
the operating company incurs a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facility at a rate ranging from to basis points based upon the ratio of our consolidated funded debt as defined in the agreement to consolidated ebitda as defined in the agreement for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters 
the credit facility matures on october  at that time  the credit facility terminates and all outstanding amounts thereunder will be due and payable 
as the partnership was unable to deliver its audited consolidated financial statements within days of december   the partnership was not in compliance with its debt covenants 
the lending institutions of our credit facility have waived the days delivery requirement until june  senior notes 
on october   we and our subsidiary markwest energy finance corporation issued million of senior notes at a fixed rate of and with a maturity date of november  subject to compliance with certain covenants  we may issue additional notes from time to time under the indenture 
interest on the notes accrues at the rate of per year and is payable semi annually in arrears on may and november  commencing on may  we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after november  at certain redemption prices together with accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption  and we may redeem all of the notes at any time prior to november  at a make whole redemption price 
in addition  prior to november   we may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a specified redemption price 
if we sell certain assets and do not reinvest the proceeds or repay senior indebtedness  or if we experience specific kinds of changes in control  we must offer to repurchase notes at a specified price 
each of our existing subsidiaries  other than markwest energy finance corporation  has guaranteed the notes jointly and severally  fully and conditionally and for so long as such subsidiary guarantees any of our other debt 
not all of our future subsidiaries will be required to become guarantors 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior debt 
these notes are senior in right of payment to all of our future subordinated debt but effectively junior in right of payment to our secured debt to the extent of the assets securing the debt  including our obligations in respect of our bank credit facility 
the proceeds from these notes were used to pay down the remaining outstanding debt under our credit facility 
the indenture governing the senior notes limits the activity of the partnership and certain of our subsidiaries  which we refer to as the restricted subsidiaries 
the provisions of such indenture places limits  to a degree  on the ability of the partnership and the restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  declare or pay dividends or redeem  repurchase or retire such equity interest or subordinated indebtedness  make investments  incur liens  create any consensual limitation on the ability of the restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends  make loans or transfer property to the partnership  engage in transactions with the partnership s affiliates  sell assets  including equity interest of the partnership s subsidiaries  make any payment on or with respect to  or purchase  redeem  defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any subordinated obligation or guarantor subordination obligation except principal and interest at maturity  and consolidate  merge or transfer assets 
the debt incurrence covenants do not presently restrict our ability to borrow under or expand our credit facility 
currently  all of our subsidiaries are restricted subsidiaries 
the partnership has agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement  or under certain circumstances  a shelf registration statement  pursuant to a registration rights agreement relating to the senior notes 
on february   the partnership filed the exchange offer registration statement relating to the senior notes 
the partnership failed to complete the exchange offer in the time provided for in the subscription agreements and as a consequence is incurring an interest rate penalty of until such time as the exchange offer is completed 
in addition  the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes contains restrictions on our ability to make cash distributions 
under the indenture  we are restricted from making a restricted payment if at the time of making the restricted payment  a default or an event of default has occurred and is continuing 
the partnership s failure to file this annual report on form k for year ended december  and its quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission s rules and regulations constituted a default under the indenture  and the failure to file the form k within thirty days after the april  notice from the indenture trustee constituted an event of default under the indenture 
on may   the partnership paid a cash distribution to unitholders for the first quarter of this cash distribution  made while the event of default for failure to file its form k had occurred and was continuing  constituted a default under the indenture  and this default matured into an event of default thirty days after such restricted payment was made  or june  both of these events of default are cured upon the filing of this form k and the quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of prior to any declaration of acceleration of the senior notes by the trustee as a result of such events of default 
liquidity requirements the partnership has budgeted million for capital expenditures for the year ending december   exclusive of any acquisitions  consisting of million for expansion capital and million for sustaining capital 
sustaining capital includes expenditures to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives 
expansion capital includes expenditures made to expand or increase the efficiency of the existing operating capacity of our assets 
expansion capital expenditures include expenditures that facilitate an increase in volumes within our operations 
we believe that our available cash  cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operating  interest and general and administrative expenses  our capital expenditure budget  our short term contractual obligations and distribution payments at current levels for the foreseeable future 
however  our ability to finance additional acquisitions will likely require the issuance of additional common units  the expansion of our credit facility  additional debt financing or a combination thereof 
in the event that we desire or need to raise additional capital  we cannot guarantee that additional funds will be available at times or on terms favorable to us  if at all 
our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders and to make acquisitions will depend upon our future operating performance  and more broadly  on the availability of debt and equity financing which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our largest customer is markwest hydrocarbon 
consequently  matters affecting the business and financial condition of markwest hydrocarbon including its operations  management  customers  vendors  and the like have the potential to impact our liquidity 
subsequent events on march   we acquired a non operating membership interest in starfish pipeline company  llc  from an affiliate of enterprise products partners  lp for million 
starfish owns the ferc regulated stingray natural gas pipeline and the unregulated triton natural gas gathering system and west cameron dehydration facility  all located in the gulf of mexico and southwestern louisiana 
the acquisition was financed through the partnership s existing credit facility and will be accounted for under the equity method of accounting beginning in the first quarter of on april   the board of directors of the general partner of markwest energy partners  lp  declared the partnership s quarterly cash distribution of per unit for the first quarter of this distribution represents an increase of per unit  or  over the previous quarterly distribution 
the indicated annual rate is per unit 
the first quarter distribution of approximately million was paid on may   to unitholders of record on may  cash flow december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by operating activities was higher in than in by million  primarily due to an increase in operating income contributed by our and acquisitions before certain non cash charges 
we expect that overall our ngl volumes will be higher than in  principally due to a full year of activity for our july east texas acquisition  and that cash provided by operating activities in will exceed levels 
however a precipitous decline in natural gas or ngl prices in would significantly affect the amount of cash flow that would be generated from operations 
net cash used in investing activities was higher in than by million because of our two acquisitions  which aggregated approximately million 
total expenditures for our acquisitions were approximately million 
in addition  the partnership used cash of million in for capital expenditures  primarily as a result of the construction of new processing plants and gathering systems in east texas to handle our future contractual commitments and for the new cobb replacement processing facility 
we had capital expenditures of million in in  we expect to use cash of million for capital expenditures and we anticipate expanding our operations in through acquisitions provided the right opportunity and financing is available 
as previously discussed  in the first quarter of  we acquired a non operating membership interest in starfish pipeline company  llc for million 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million 
our equity financings and borrowings under our credit facility and bond offering were primarily responsible for the inflow 
the partnership raised funds through two public offerings and one private offering of partnership units generating net proceeds of million 
in addition  the partnership issued a net of million of debt to finance its two acquisitions in the general partner of the partnership provided funds of million to fund construction activities at the cobb processing plant 
distributions to unitholders were million  representing an increase over the million paid in for the year ended december   the partnership s financing activities provided million 
the partnership issued million of debt to finance its four acquisitions in additional funds were provided by a private placement of common units for million  and a contribution by the general partner of million to fund construction activities at the cobb processing plant 
distributions to unitholders in were million 
total contractual cash obligations a summary of our total contractual cash obligations as of december   is as follows  in thousands payment due by period type of obligation total obligation due in due in due in thereafter long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations includes interest on our senior notes through of million on our senior notes 
annual rent expense under these operating leases was million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
critical accounting policies a summary of the significant accounting policies that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is presented in note of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
certain of these accounting policies require the use of estimates 
we have identified the following estimates that  in our opinion  are subjective in nature  require the exercise of judgment  and involve complex analysis 
these estimates are based on our knowledge and understanding of current conditions and actions that we may take in the future 
changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events 
subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the long lived assets  including related intangibles  of identifiable business activities for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if impairment has occurred  the amount of impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a provision for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value 
for assets identified to be disposed of in the future  the carrying value of these assets is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell to determine if impairment is required 
until the assets are disposed of  an estimate of the fair value is recalculated when related events or circumstances change 
when determining whether impairment of one of our long lived assets has occurred  we must estimate the undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset or asset group 
our estimate of cash flows is based on assumptions regarding the volume of reserves behind the asset and future ngl product and natural gas prices 
the amount of reserves and drilling activity are dependent in part on natural gas prices 
projections of reserves and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors  including changes in general economic conditions in regions in which our products are located  the availability and prices of ngl products and competing commodities  the availability and prices of natural gas supply  our ability to negotiate favorable marketing agreements  the risks that third party natural gas exploration and production activities will not occur or be successful  our dependence on certain significant customers  producers  gatherers  treaters and transporters of natural gas  and competition from other ngl processors  including major energy companies 
any significant negative variance in any of the above assumptions or factors could materially affect our cash flows  which could require us to record an impairment of an asset 
valuation of intangibles significant judgment is required in establishing the fair value and determining appropriate amortization periods for our intangible assets 
intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the fair values of acquired intangible assets are determined by management using relevant information and assumptions 
fair value is generally calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate  which requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate 
amortization of intangible assets with finite useful lives is recorded over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
at december   we had million of net intangible assets 
an impairment of our intangible assets could result in a material  non cash expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
the partnership applies sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets in determining the life of its intangible assets 
in establishing the amortization period for the customer contract intangible asset for the east texas acquisition  which accounts for million of the intangible assets  the partnership considered the life of the assets to which the contracts relate  anticipated drilling activity in the area  likelihood of renewals  competitive factors  regulatory or legal provisions  and maintenance and renewal costs 
as a result of an analysis of these factors  the customer contracts are expected to have an average life of years  including anticipated renewals 
based on an independent third party analysis of the reserves in the area and the pertinent terms of the customer contracts  the partnership has determined that a straight line amortization method is appropriate and representative of the economic benefits of the intangible asset 
because of the significant judgment required in determining the fair value and life and related method of amortization of customer contract intangible assets  actual cash flows could differ significantly from estimated amounts used to determine the fair value  life and amortization method of these intangible assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise  or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas no 
r requires an entity to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees in the income statement 
the revised statement requires that an entity account for those transactions using the fair value based method  and eliminates the intrinsic value method of accounting in apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  which was permitted under sfas no 
 as originally issued 
the revised statement requires entities to disclose information about the nature of the share based payment transactions and the effects of those transactions on the financial statements 
sfas r is effective for public companies for the first fiscal year beginning after december  all public companies must use either the modified prospective or the modified retrospective transition method 
we have not yet evaluated the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement on our financial statements 
on march   the sec staff issued sab no 
 share based payment  to express the views of the staff regarding the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations and to provide the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
the partnership will take into consideration the additional guidance provided by sab in connection with the implementation of sfas no 
r 
in march  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which clarifies the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
a conditional asset retirement obligation is an unconditional legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
therefore  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation under sfas no 
if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
fin permits  but does not require  restatement of interim financial information 
the provisions of fin are effective for reporting periods ending after december  the partnership is currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on its consolidated financial statements 
risk factors in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this form k  you should carefully consider the following factors when evaluating markwest energy partners 
risks inherent in our business if we are unable to successfully integrate our recent or future acquisitions  our future financial performance may be negatively impacted 
our future growth will depend in part on our ability to integrate our recent acquisitions and our ability to make future acquisitions of assets and businesses at attractive prices 
we recently completed the east texas system  western oklahoma and michigan crude pipeline acquisitions  which geographically expanded our operations in the southwest  particularly east texas and oklahoma  and expanded our operations in michigan 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully integrate these or any other acquisitions into our operations  or that we will achieve the desired profitability from such acquisitions 
failure to successfully integrate these substantial or future acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the integration of acquisitions with our existing business involves numerous risks  including operating a significantly larger combined organization and integrating additional midstream operations to our existing operations  difficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired businesses  especially if the assets acquired are in a new business segment or geographical area  the loss of customers or key employees from the acquired businesses  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the failure to realize expected synergies and cost savings  coordinating geographically disparate organizations  systems and facilities  integrating personnel from diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures  and consolidating corporate and administrative functions 
further  unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined  and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition 
following an acquisition  we may discover previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired assets that will be subject to the same stringent environmental laws and regulations relating to releases of pollutants into the environment and environmental protection as our existing plants  pipelines and facilities 
thus  our operation of these new assets could cause us to incur increased costs to attain or maintain compliance with such laws and regulations 
if we consummate any future acquisition  our capitalization and results of operation may change significantly  and you will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic  financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources 
our acquisition strategy is based in part on our expectation of ongoing divestitures of assets within the midstream industry 
a material decrease in such divestitures will limit our opportunities for future acquisitions and could adversely affect our operations and cash flows available for distribution to our unitholders 
a significant decrease in natural gas production in our areas of operation due to the decline in production from existing wells  depressed commodity prices  reduced drilling activities or other factors otherwise could adversely affect our revenues and operating income and cash flow 
our profitability is materially impacted by the volume of natural gas we gather  transmit and process and ngls we transport and fractionate at our facilities 
a material decrease in natural gas production in our areas of operation would result in a decline in the volume of natural gas delivered to our pipelines and facilities for gathering  transporting and processing and ngls delivered to our pipelines and facility for fractionation and transportation 
the effect of such a material decrease would be to reduce our revenue and operating income 
fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves 
drilling activity generally decreases as oil and natural gas prices decrease 
we have no control over the level of drilling activity in the areas of operations  the amount of reserves underlying the wells and the rate at which production from a well will decline  sometimes referred to as the decline rate 
in addition  we have no control over producers or their production decisions  which are affected by  among other things  prevailing and projected energy prices  demand for hydrocarbons  the level of reserves  geological considerations  governmental regulation and the availability and cost of capital 
failure to connect new wells to our gathering systems would  therefore  result in the amount of natural gas we gather  transmit and process and the amount of ngls we transport and fractionate being reduced substantially over time and could  upon exhaustion of the current wells  cause us to abandon our gathering systems and  possibly  cease gathering operations 
our ability to connect to new wells will be dependent on the level of drilling activity in our areas of operations and competitive market factors 
as a consequence of such declines  our revenues would be materially adversely affected 
our substantial debt and other financial obligations could impair our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and our ability to fulfill our debt obligations 
we have substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations 
subject to the restrictions governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations and the indenture governing the notes  we may incur significant additional indebtedness and other financial obligations  which may be secured and or structurally senior to the notes 
our substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations could have important consequences 
for example  they could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes  impair our ability to obtain additional financings in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes  have a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements and an event of default occurs as a result of that failure that is not cured or waived  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness and other financial obligations  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  distributions and other general partnership requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt 
these restrictions could limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to obtain future financings  make needed capital expenditures  withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general  conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise 
our existing credit facility contains covenants requiring us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial conditions 
we may be unable to meet those ratios and conditions 
any future breach of any of these covenants or our failure to meet any of these ratios or conditions could result in a default under the terms of our credit facility  which could result in acceleration of our debt and other financial obligations 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation proceeding or proceed against the collateral 
a material decrease in the supply of crude oil available for transport through our michigan crude pipeline  or a significant decrease in demand for refined products in the markets served by this pipeline  could adversely affect our revenues and cash flow 
the volume of crude oil we transport through our michigan crude pipeline depends on the availability of crude oil produced in the areas accessible to our crude oil pipeline 
if there were a material decrease in the volume of crude oil shipped on the pipeline due to reduced production from our shippers  less expensive supplies of crude oil available to the markets served by our pipeline  competition from trucks or reduced demand for refined product  such events may adversely affect our revenues and cash flow from the pipeline operations 
we depend on third parties for the natural gas we process and the ngls we fractionate at our facilities  and any reduction in these quantities could reduce our revenues and cash flow 
although we obtain our supply of natural gas and ngls from numerous third party producers  a significant portion is supplied by a limited number of key producers suppliers who are committed to us under processing contracts 
however  pursuant to many of these contracts or other supply arrangements  the producers are under no obligation to deliver a specific quantity of natural gas or ngls to our facilities 
if these key suppliers or a significant number of other producers were to decrease materially the supply of natural gas or ngls to our systems and facilities for any reason  we could experience difficulty in replacing those lost volumes 
because our operating costs are primarily fixed  a reduction in the volumes of natural gas or ngls delivered to us would result not only in a reduction of revenues but also a decline in net income and cash flow of similar or greater magnitude 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our gas processing  transportation  fractionation and storage agreements with markwest hydrocarbon  and its failure to satisfy its payment or other obligations under these agreements could reduce our revenues and cash flow 
markwest hydrocarbon accounts for a significant portion of our revenues and gross margin 
these revenues and margins are generated by the volumes of natural gas contractually committed to markwest hydrocarbon by the appalachian producers described above and the fees generated from processing  transportation  fractionation and storage services provided to markwest hydrocarbon 
we expect to derive a significant portion of our revenues and gross margin from the services we provide under our contracts with markwest hydrocarbon for the foreseeable future 
any default or nonperformance by markwest hydrocarbon of its contractual obligations to us could significantly reduce our revenues and cash flows 
thus  any factor or event adversely affecting markwest hydrocarbon s business  creditworthiness or its ability to perform under its contracts with us or its other contracts related to our business could also adversely affect us 
the fees charged to third parties under our gathering  processing  transmission  transportation  fractionation and storage agreements may not escalate sufficiently to cover increases in costs and the agreements may not be renewed or may be suspended in some circumstances 
our costs may increase at a rate greater than the rate that the fees we charge to third parties increase pursuant to our contracts with them 
furthermore  third parties may not renew their contracts with us 
additionally  some third parties obligations under their agreements with us may be permanently or temporarily reduced upon the occurrence of certain events  some of which are beyond our control  including force majeure events wherein the supply of either natural gas  ngls or crude oil are curtailed or cut off 
force majeure events include but are not limited to revolutions  wars  acts of enemies  embargoes  import or export restrictions  strikes  lockouts  fires  storms  floods  acts of god  explosions  mechanical or physical failures of equipment or facilities of the partnership or third parties 
if the escalation of fees is insufficient to cover increased costs  if third parties do not renew or extend their contracts with us or if any third party suspends or terminates its contracts with us  our financial results would be negatively impacted 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties  and a general increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by our customers could reduce our revenues and cash flow 
we are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers 
any increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by our customers could reduce our revenues and cash flow 
we may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers  which would reduce our revenues and limit our future profitability 
the renewal or replacement of existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond our control  including competition from other pipelines  and the price of  and demand for  natural gas  ngls and crude oil in the markets we serve 
our competitors include large oil  natural gas  refining and petrochemical companies  some of whom have greater financial resources and access to natural gas and ngl supplies than we do 
additionally  our customers who gather gas through facilities that are not otherwise dedicated to us may develop their own processing and fractionation facilities in lieu of using our services 
certain of our competitors may also have advantages in competing for acquisitions or other new business opportunities because of their financial resources and access to natural gas and ngl supplies 
as a consequence of the increase in competition in the industry and volatility of natural gas prices  end users and utilities are reluctant to enter into long term purchase contracts 
many end users purchase natural gas from more than one natural gas company and have the ability to change providers at any time 
some of these end users also have the ability to switch between gas and alternative fuels in response to relative price fluctuations in the market 
because there are numerous companies of greatly varying size and financial capacity that compete with us in the marketing of natural gas  we often compete in the end user and utilities markets primarily on the basis of price 
the inability of our management to renew or replace our current contracts as they expire and to respond appropriately to changing market conditions could have a negative effect on our profitability 
for more information regarding the competition that we have  please see item competition  which is incorporated herein by reference 
our profitability is affected by the volatility of ngl product and natural gas prices 
the profitability of our natural gas processing and ngl fractionation operations is affected by volatility in prevailing ngl product and natural gas prices 
changes in the prices of ngl products have historically correlated closely with changes in the price of crude oil 
crude oil  ngl product and natural gas prices have been subject to significant volatility in recent years in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for ngl products and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control  including the level of domestic oil  natural gas and ngl production  imports of crude oil  natural gas and ngls  seasonality  the condition of the us economy  political conditions in other oil producing and natural gas producing countries  and domestic government regulation  legislation and policies 
the gross margins we realize under percent of proceeds and percent of index contracts  as well as our keep whole contracts  are directly affected by changes in ngl product prices and natural gas prices  and are therefore more sensitive to volatility in commodity prices than our fee based contracts 
additionally  changes in natural gas prices may indirectly impact our profitability since prices can influence drilling activity and well operations and thus the volume of gas we gather and process 
in the past  the prices of natural gas and ngls have been extremely volatile  and we expect this volatility to continue 
we are subject to operating and litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance 
our operations are subject to numerous operating hazards and risks incidental to processing  transporting  fractionating and storing natural gas and ngls and to transporting and storing crude oil 
these hazards include damage to pipelines  plants  related equipment and surrounding properties caused by floods and other natural disasters  inadvertent damage from construction and farm equipment  leakage of crude oil  natural gas  ngls and other hydrocarbons  fires and explosions  and other hazards  including those associated with high sulfur content  or sour gas that could also result in personal injury and loss of life  pollution and suspension of operations 
as a result  we may be a defendant in various legal proceedings and litigation arising from our operations 
we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates 
as a result of market conditions  certain insurance premiums and deductibles could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
for example  insurance carriers are now requiring broad exclusions for losses due to war risk and terrorist acts 
if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
transportation on certain of our pipelines may be subject to federal or state rate and service regulation  and the imposition and or cost of compliance with such regulation could adversely affect our profitability 
some of our gas  liquids and crude oil transmission operations may be subject to jurisdiction and rate and service regulations of the ferc or of various state regulatory bodies  depending upon the factual circumstances upon which each pipeline s jurisdictional status is based 
ferc generally regulates the transportation of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce  and ferc s regulatory authority also extends to facilities construction  acquisition  extension or abandonment of services or facilities  accounts and records  and depreciation and amortization policies 
intrastate natural gas pipeline operations are generally not subject to regulation by ferc  and some gathering systems are specifically exempted from ferc regulation by the natural gas act nga  but such operations are often subject to regulation by various agencies of the states in which they are located 
the applicable statutes and regulations generally require that our rates and terms and conditions of service provide no more than a fair return on the aggregate value of the facilities used to render services  and ferc rate cases can involve complex and expensive proceedings 
our appalachian pipeline carries ngls across state lines 
the primary shipper on the pipeline is markwest hydrocarbon  who has entered into agreements with us providing for a fixed transportation charge for the term of the agreements  which expire on december  we are the only other shipper on the pipeline 
as we do not operate our appalachian pipeline as a common carrier and do not hold the pipeline out for service to the public generally  there are currently no third party shippers on this pipeline and the pipeline is and will continue to be operated as a proprietary facility and consequently should not be subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc 
however  we cannot provide assurance that ferc would not determine that such transportation is within its jurisdiction 
in such a case  we would be required to file a tariff for such transportation with ferc and provide a cost justification for the transportation charge 
markwest hydrocarbon has agreed to not challenge the status of our appalachian pipeline or the transportation charge during the term of our agreements with markwest hydrocarbon 
moreover  the likelihood of other entities seeking to utilize our appalachian pipeline is remote 
however  we cannot predict whether an assertion of ferc jurisdiction might be made with respect to this pipeline  nor provide assurance that such an assertion would not adversely affect our results of operations 
with respect to the michigan crude pipeline  one shipper recently contacted ferc to inquire about a transportation rate increase and the pipeline s regulatory rate structure 
in response  ferc requested that we contact the shipper to initiate a discussion with the shipper regarding its questions 
we are presently in discussions with all shippers regarding rate structures and are attempting to resolve any issues they may have 
ferc also requested that we file a tariff 
while the michigan crude pipeline operations are entirely within the state of michigan and have been regulated by the state of michigan  we have calculated and determined that our current and proposed rate structures are well below rates which would be allowed under ferc s cost of service rate making structure 
however  we cannot predict whether a ferc jurisdictional challenge might be made with respect to the michigan crude pipeline  nor provide assurance that such a development would not adversely affect our results of operations or cash flow 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental  safety and other regulatory matters  and the violation of or the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our profitability 
our business is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous governmental agencies that enforce complex and stringent laws and regulations with respect to a wide range of environmental  safety and other regulatory matters 
we could be adversely affected by increased costs due to more strict pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from non compliance with required operating or other regulatory permits 
new environmental laws and regulations might adversely impact our products and activities  including the gathering  processing  transportation  fractionation  and storage of natural gas and ngls and the transportation and storage of crude oil 
federal  state and local agencies also could impose additional safety requirements  any of which could affect our profitability 
in addition  we face the risk of accidental releases or spills associated with our operations  which could result in material costs and liabilities  including those relating to claims for damages to property and persons 
failure by us to comply with environmental or safety related laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations and even the issuance of injunctions that restrict or prohibit the performance of our operations 
for more information regarding the environmental  safety and other regulatory matters that could affect our business  please see item regulatory matters and environmental matters  which is incorporated herein by reference 
we are indemnified for liabilities arising from an ongoing remediation of property on which our facilities are located and our results of operation and our ability to make payments of principal and interest on the notes could be adversely affected if the indemnifying party fails to perform its indemnification obligation 
the previous owner operator of our boldman and cobb facilities has been or is currently involved in investigatory or remedial activities with respect to the real property underlying these facilities pursuant to an administrative order by consent for removal actions with epa regions ii  iii  iv  and v in september and an agreed order entered into with the kentucky natural resources and environmental protection cabinet in october the previous owner operator has agreed to retain sole liability and responsibility for  and indemnify markwest hydrocarbon against  any environmental liabilities associated with the epa administrative order  the kentucky agreed order or any other environmental condition related to the real property prior to the effective dates of markwest hydrocarbon s agreements pursuant to which markwest hydrocarbon leased or purchased the real property 
in addition  the previous owner operator has agreed to perform all the required response actions at its cost and expense in a manner that minimizes interference with markwest hydrocarbon s use of the properties 
on may   markwest hydrocarbon assigned to us the benefit of this indemnity from the previous owner operator 
our results of operation and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders could be adversely affected if in the future either the previous owner operator or markwest hydrocarbon fails to perform under the indemnification provisions of which we are the beneficiary 
the amount of gas we process  gather and transmit or the crude oil we gather and transport may be reduced if the pipelines to which we deliver the natural gas or crude oil cannot or will not accept the gas or crude oil 
all of the natural gas we process  gather and transmit is delivered into pipelines for further delivery to end users 
if these pipelines cannot or will not accept delivery of the gas due to downstream constraints on the pipeline  we will be forced to limit or stop the throughput of gas through our pipelines and processing systems 
in addition  interruption of pipeline service upstream of our processing facilities would likewise limit or stop throughput through our processing facilities 
likewise  if the pipelines into which we deliver crude oil are interrupted  we will be limited in  or prevented from  conducting our crude oil transportation operations 
such interruptions or constraints on pipeline service may be caused by any number of factors beyond our control  including necessary and scheduled maintenance as well as unexpected damage to the pipeline 
since our revenues and gross margin depend upon the volumes of natural gas we process  gather and transmit  the throughput of ngls through our transportation  fractionation and storage facilities and the volume of crude oil we gather and transport  any such limitation or reduction of volumes could result in a material reduction in our gross margin 
our business would be adversely affected if operations at any of our facilities were interrupted 
our operations are dependent upon the infrastructure that we have developed  including processing and fractionation plants  storage facilities and various means of transportation 
any significant interruption at these facilities or pipelines or our inability to transmit natural gas or ngls  or transport crude oil to or from these facilities or pipelines for any reason would adversely affect our results of operations 
operations at our facilities could be partially or completely shut down  temporarily or permanently  as the result of any number of circumstances that are not within our control  such as unscheduled turnarounds or catastrophic events at our physical plants  labor difficulties that result in a work stoppage or slowdown  and a disruption in the supply of crude oil to our crude oil pipeline  natural gas to our processing plants or gathering pipelines  or a disruption in the supply of ngls to our transportation pipeline and fractionation facility 
due to our lack of asset diversification  adverse developments in our gathering  processing  transportation  transmission  fractionation and storage businesses would reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
we rely exclusively on the revenues generated from our gathering  processing  transportation  transmission  fractionation and storage businesses 
due to our lack of asset diversification  an adverse development in one of these businesses would have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition and results of operations than if we maintained more diverse assets 
risks related to our partnership structure cost reimbursements and fees due our general partner may be substantial and reduce our cash available for distribution to you 
payments to our general partner may be substantial and reduce the amount of available cash for distribution to unitholders 
prior to making any distribution on the common units  we reimburse our general partner for all expenses it incurs on our behalf 
our general partner has sole discretion in determining the amount of these expenses 
our general partner and its affiliates also may provide us other services for which we will be charged fees as determined by our general partner 
markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates have conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary responsibilities  which may permit them to favor their own interests to your detriment 
markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates own and control our general partner 
markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates also own a significant limited partner interest in us 
a number of officers and employees of markwest hydrocarbon and our general partner also own interests in us 
conflicts of interest may arise between markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates  including our general partner  on the one hand  and us  on the other hand 
as a result of these conflicts  our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our unitholders 
these conflicts include  among others  the following situations conflicts relating to control employees of markwest hydrocarbon who provide services to us also devote significant time to the businesses of markwest hydrocarbon and are compensated by markwest hydrocarbon for these services  neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires markwest hydrocarbon to pursue a future business strategy that favors us or utilizes our assets for processing  transportation or fractionation services we provide 
markwest hydrocarbon s directors and officers have a fiduciary duty to make these decisions in the best interests of the stockholders of markwest hydrocarbon  our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us  such as markwest hydrocarbon  in resolving conflicts of interest  which has the effect of limiting its fiduciary duty to our unitholders  our general partner may limit its liability and reduce its fiduciary duties  while also restricting the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that  without the limitations  might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty 
as a result of purchasing units  our unitholders consent to some actions and conflicts of interest that might otherwise constitute a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law  our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by our general partner and its affiliates  including the processing  transportation and fractionation agreements with markwest hydrocarbon  our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel  accountants or others to perform services for us  in some instances  our general partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of cash distributions  even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make a distribution on the subordinated units or to make incentive distributions or to hasten the conversion of subordinated units  and our partnership agreement gives our general partner broad discretion in establishing financial reserves for the proper conduct of our business 
these reserves also will affect the amount of cash available for distribution 
our general partner may establish reserves for distribution on the subordinated units  but only if those reserves will not prevent us from distributing the full minimum quarterly distribution  plus any arrearages  on the common units for the following four quarters 
conflicts relating to costs our general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales  capital expenditures  borrowings  issuance of additional partnership securities and reserves  each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders  our general partner determines which costs incurred by markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates are reimbursable by us  and our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf 
unitholders have less ability to elect or remove management than holders of common stock in a corporation 
unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation  unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business  and therefore limited ability to influence management s decisions regarding our business 
unitholders did not elect our general partner or its board of directors and have no right to elect our general partner or its board of directors on an annual or other continuing basis 
markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates choose the board of directors of our general partner 
the directors of our general partner also have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to its members  markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates 
furthermore  if unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner  they have little ability to remove our general partner 
first  our general partner generally may not be removed except upon the vote of the holders of at least of the outstanding units voting together as a single class 
also  if our general partner is removed without cause during the subordination period and units held by markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates are not voted in favor of that removal  all remaining subordinated units will automatically be converted into common units and any existing arrearages on the common units will be extinguished 
a removal under these circumstances would adversely affect the common units by prematurely eliminating their contractual right to distributions over the subordinated units  which would otherwise have continued until we had met certain distribution and performance tests 
cause is narrowly defined to mean that a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final  non appealable judgment finding our general partner liable for actual fraud  gross negligence  or willful or wanton misconduct in its capacity as our general partner 
cause does not include most cases of charges of poor management of the business  so the removal of our general partner because of the unitholders dissatisfaction with our general partner s performance in managing our partnership will most likely result in the termination of the subordination period 
furthermore  unitholders voting rights are further restricted by the partnership agreement provision which states that any units held by a person who owns or more of any class of units then outstanding  other than our general partner  its affiliates  their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our general partner  cannot be voted on any matter 
in addition  the partnership agreement contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations  as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders ability to influence the manner or direction of management 
these provisions may discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our general partner or otherwise change our management 
as a result of these provisions  the price at which the common units will trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price 
the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party  and that party could replace our current management team  in each case without unitholder consent 
our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders 
furthermore  there is no restriction in the partnership agreement on the ability of the owners of our general partner from transferring their ownership interest in our general partner to a third party 
the new owner of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with its own choices and to control the decisions taken by the board of directors and officers 
our general partner s absolute discretion in determining the level of cash reserves may adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders 
our partnership agreement requires our general partner to deduct from operating surplus cash reserves that in its reasonable discretion are necessary to fund our future operating expenditures 
in addition  the partnership agreement permits our general partner to reduce available cash by establishing cash reserves for the proper conduct of our business  to comply with applicable law or agreements to which we are a party or to provide funds for future distributions to partners 
these cash reserves will affect the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
our partnership agreement contains provisions  which reduce the remedies available to unitholders for actions that might otherwise constitute a breach of fiduciary duty by our general partner 
our partnership agreement limits the liability and reduces the fiduciary duties of our general partner to our unitholders 
the partnership agreement also restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions that would otherwise constitute breaches of our general partner s fiduciary duties 
if you choose to purchase a common unit  you will be treated as having consented to the various actions contemplated in the partnership agreement and conflicts of interest that might otherwise be considered a breach of fiduciary duties under applicable state law 
markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates may engage in competition with us 
markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates may engage in competition with us 
pursuant to the omnibus agreement  markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates have agreed not to engage in  whether by acquisition  construction or otherwise  the business of processing natural gas and transporting  fractionating and storing ngls 
these restrictions  however  do not apply to the gathering of natural gas  any business operated by markwest hydrocarbon or any of its subsidiaries at the closing of our initial public offering  any business that markwest hydrocarbon or any of its subsidiaries acquires or constructs that has a fair market value of less than million  any business that markwest hydrocarbon or any of its subsidiaries acquires or constructs that has a fair market value of million or more if we have been offered the opportunity to purchase the business for fair market value  and we decline to do so with the concurrence of the conflicts committee of our general partner  and any business that markwest hydrocarbon or any of its subsidiaries acquires or constructs where the fair market value of the restricted business is million or more and represents less than of the aggregate value of the entire business acquired or constructed  provided  however  that following completion of such acquisition or construction  we are provided the opportunity to purchase such restricted business  and we decline to do so with the concurrence of the conflicts committee of our general partner 
upon a change of control of markwest hydrocarbon or a sale of the general partner by markwest hydrocarbon  the non competition provisions of the omnibus agreement will terminate 
we do not have any employees and rely solely on employees of markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates who serve as our agents 
we do not have any employees and rely solely on employees of markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates who serve as our agents 
markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates conduct businesses and activities of their own in which we have no economic interest 
if these separate activities are significantly greater than our activities  there could be material competition for the time and effort of the employees who provide services to our general partner 
if the employees of markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates do not devote sufficient attention to the management and operation of our business  our financial results may suffer and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders may be reduced 
we may issue additional common units without your approval  which would dilute your ownership interests 
during the subordination period  our general partner  without the approval of our unitholders  may cause us to issue up to  additional common units 
our general partner may also cause us to issue an unlimited number of additional common units or other equity securities of equal rank with the common units  without unitholder approval  in a number of circumstances such as the issuance of common units in connection with acquisitions or capital improvements that increase cash flow from operations per unit on a pro forma basis  the conversion of subordinated units into common units  the conversion of units of equal rank with the common units into common units under some circumstances  the conversion of the general partner interest and the incentive distribution rights into common units as a result of the withdrawal of our general partner  issuances of common units under our long term incentive plan  or issuances of common units to repay indebtedness  the cost of which to service is greater than the distribution obligations associated with the units issued in connection with the debt s retirement 
the issuance of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects our unitholders proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease  the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease  because a lower percentage of total outstanding units will be subordinated units  the risk that a shortfall in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution will be borne by our common unitholders will increase  the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished  and the market price of the common units may decline 
after the end of the subordination period  we may issue an unlimited number of limited partner interests of any type without the approval of our unitholders 
our partnership agreement does not give our unitholders the right to approve our issuance of equity securities ranking junior to the common units at any time 
our general partner has a limited call right that may require you to sell your common units at an undesirable time or price 
if at any time more than of the outstanding common units are owned by our general partner and its affiliates  our general partner will have the right  but not the obligation  which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us  to acquire all  but not less than all  of the remaining common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then current market price 
as a result  you may be required to sell your common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on your investment 
you may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of your units 
you may not have limited liability if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business 
under delaware law  you could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that the right or the exercise of the right by our unitholders as a group to remove or replace our general partner  to approve some amendments to the partnership agreement  or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the control of our business 
our general partner generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership  such as its debts and environmental liabilities  except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to our general partner 
in addition  section of the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act provides that  under some circumstances  a unitholder may be liable to us for the amount of a distribution for a period of three years from the date of the distribution 
we have found material weaknesses in our internal controls that require remediation and concluded  pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  that our internal control over financial reporting at december  were not effective 
as we disclose in our management s report on internal control over financial reporting in part ii  item a  controls and procedures  of this form k  we have discovered deficiencies  including material weaknesses  in our internal control over financial reporting 
while we are taking immediate steps to correct our internal control weaknesses  the material weaknesses that have been discovered will not be considered remediated until the new and improved internal controls operate for a period of time  are tested and it is concluded that such new and improved internal controls are operating effectively 
pending the successful completion of such testing and the hiring of additional personnel  we will perform mitigating procedures relating to our internal control weaknesses 
if we fail to remediate any material weaknesses  we could be unable to provide timely and reliable financial information  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the inability of the partnership to file this annual report on form k for the year ended december  and our quarterly report for the quarter ended march  on time has impacted the partnership in various ways 
the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes contains restrictions on our ability to make cash distributions 
under the indenture  we are restricted from making a restricted payment if at the time of making the restricted payment  a default or an event of default has occurred and is continuing 
the partnership s failure to file this annual report on form k for year ended december  and its quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission s rules and regulations constituted a default under the indenture  and the failure to file the form k within thirty days after the april  notice from the indenture trustee constituted an event of default under the indenture 
on may   the partnership paid a cash distribution to unitholders for the first quarter of this cash distribution  made while the event of default for failure to file its form k had occurred and was continuing  constituted a default under the indenture  and this default matured into an event of default thirty days after such restricted payment was made  or june  both of these events of default are cured upon the filing of this form k and the quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of prior to any declaration of acceleration of the senior notes by the trustee as a result of such events of default 
in addition  as the partnership was unable to deliver its audited consolidated financial statements within days of december   the partnership is not in compliance with its debt covenants for the credit facility 
the lending institutions of our credit facility have waived the days delivery requirement until june  the partnership has agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement  or under certain circumstances  a shelf registration statement  pursuant to a registration rights agreement relating to the senior notes 
on february   the partnership filed the exchange offer registration statement relating to the senior notes 
the partnership failed to complete the exchange offer in the time provided for in the subscription agreements and as a consequence is incurring an interest rate penalty of until such time as the exchange offer is completed 
in addition  the inability of the partnership to file this annual report on form k for the year ended december  on time may impact the timing of the partnership s ability to raise equity in the future 
we will no longer have the ability to incorporate by reference into the registration statements for one year following the filing of this form k should the partnership choose to raise capital through a public offering registered on form s in effect  if the partnership raises additional capital through public debt or equity offerings  the partnership will be required to file a form s registration statement  which is a long form type of registration statement 
the requirement to file a form s registration statement may effect our ability to access the capital markets on a timely basis and will increase the costs of doing so 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we face market risk from commodity price changes and to a lesser extent interest rate changes 
commodity price our primary risk management objective is to reduce volatility in our cash flows

we may utilize a combination of fixed price forward contracts  fixed for floating price swaps and options available in the over the counter otc market 
the partnership may also enter into futures contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex 
swaps and futures contracts allow us to protect our margins because corresponding losses or gains on the financial instruments are generally offset by gains or losses in the physical market 
we enter into otc swaps with financial institutions and other energy company counterparties 
we conduct a standard credit review on counterparties and have agreements containing collateral requirements where deemed necessary 
we use standardized swap agreements that allow for offset of positive and negative exposures 
we are subject to margin deposit requirements under otc agreements with non bank counterparties and nymex positions 
as of december   we have hedged natural gas price risk in texas part of our pinnacle acquisition by entering into fixed for floating price swaps that settle monthly through december  as follows mmbtu mmbtu interest rate although we had no debt outstanding with a floating interest rate at year end  we would be exposed to changes in interest rates in the future if we were to draw on our partnership credit facility 
we may make use of interest rate swap agreements in the future  to adjust the ratio of fixed and floating rates in our debt portfolio
