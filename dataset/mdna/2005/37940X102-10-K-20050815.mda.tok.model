business description we are a leading payment processing company 
as a high volume payments processor of electronic transactions  we enable merchants  multinational corporations  financial institutions  consumers  government agencies and other profit and non profit business enterprises to facilitate payments to purchase goods and services or further other economic goals 
our role is to serve as an intermediary in the exchange of information and funds that must occur between the necessary parties so that a transaction can be completed 
including our time as part of national data corporation  now known as ndchealth  or ndc  we have provided transaction processing services since we were incorporated in georgia as global payments inc in september and we spun off from ndc on january  we market our products and services throughout the united states  canada and europe  and we also conduct business in latin america  morocco and the philippines through our money transfer offerings 
we operate in one business segment  electronic transaction payment processing  and we provide products through our merchant services and money transfer offerings 
our merchant services offerings target customers in many vertical industries including government  professional services  restaurants  universities  utilities  gaming  retail and health care 
our money transfer offerings primarily target immigrant laborers in the united states and europe 
total revenues from our merchant services and money transfer offerings are as follows in thousands merchant services money transfer for a discussion of revenues in the united states  canada and europe for the fiscal years ended may   and  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
merchant services our merchant services offerings provide merchants and financial institutions with credit and debit card transaction processing  check services  and terminal management 
we use two basic business models to market our merchant services offerings 
one model  referred to as direct merchant services  features a salaried and commissioned sales force  independent sales organizations  or isos  and independent sales representatives  all of whom sell our end to end services directly to merchants 
our other model  referred to as indirect merchant services  provides the same basic products and services as direct merchant services  primarily to financial 
table of contents institutions and isos on an unbundled basis  that in turn resell our products and services to their merchants 
we also offer sales  installation  and servicing of atm and point of sale pos terminals and selected card issuing services  which are components of indirect merchant services  through muzo  as  or muzo  our subsidiary based in the czech republic 
our direct merchant services are marketed in the united states and canada and our indirect merchant services are marketed in the united states  canada and central and eastern europe 
for the fiscal year ended may   approximately of our total revenue arose from direct merchant services and approximately arose from indirect merchant services 
direct merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced as a percentage of transaction value  whereas indirect merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced on a specified amount per transaction 
in both merchant services models  we also charge for other processing fees unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value 
direct merchant services we market our services through a variety of sales channels that includes a dedicated sales force  isos  an internal telesales group  trade associations  alliance and agent bank relationships  retail outlets and financial institutions 
in addition to receiving referrals from approximately  bank branch locations in canada  we have affiliations with more than organizations  including financial institutions  alliance bank branch locations and trade associations  and approximately certified application providers  or caps  in the united states that provide sales leads 
additionally  we market directly to customers through print advertising and direct mail efforts 
we also participate in major industry tradeshows and publicity events and actively execute various public relations campaigns 
we pursue this strategy because we believe that it utilizes one of the lowest delivery cost systems available to successfully acquire target customers 
credit and debit card transaction processing credit and debit card transaction processing includes visa  mastercard and on line and off line debit card processing 
credit and debit card processing involves a consumer or cardholder acquiring goods or services from a merchant and using a credit or debit card as the form of payment 
the term merchant generally refers to any organization that accepts credit or debit cards for the payment of goods and services  such as retail stores  both physical locations and internet sites  restaurants  universities  and government agencies 
we are the processing intermediary between the merchant and the card associations  debit networks  and financial institutions 
although card transactions may appear to be simple  a transaction requires a complex process involving various participants in a series of electronic connections 
in addition to electronic transaction payment processors such as global payments  also known as merchant acquirers  participants in this process also include card issuers  cardholders  merchants  members  and card associations 
card issuers are financial institutions that issue credit and debit cards to approved applicants and are identifiable by their trade name typically imprinted on the issued cards 
an approved applicant for a credit or debit card from a card issuer is referred to as a cardholder  and may be any entity for which an issuer wishes to extend a line of credit  such as a consumer  corporation  or government agency 
the cardholder may use the card at any merchant location that meets the qualification standards of the relevant card association  such as mastercard  visa  other cards such as american express  discover  and diners club  or debit networks such as star  nyce  and pulse in the united states and interac in canada 
the card associations and debit networks consist of members  generally financial institutions  who establish uniform regulations that govern much of the industry 
during a typical card transaction  the merchant and the card issuer do not interface directly with each other  but instead rely on merchant acquirers 
a merchant acquirer can be an independent processor that acts with a member sponsor  such as global payments  or the merchant acquirer can be a bank itself 
we perform a series of services including authorization  electronic draft capture  
table of contents file transfers to facilitate the funds settlement and certain exception based  back office support services such as chargeback and retrieval resolution 
the following is a more detailed description of credit and debit card transactions a card transaction begins when a cardholder presents a card for payment at a merchant location and the merchant swipes the card s magnetic strip through a pos terminal card reader  which may be provided by global payments through our terminal management offering 
alternatively  card and transaction information may be captured and transmitted to our network through a pos device by one of a number of products that we offer directly or through a cap 
for a credit card transaction  authorization services generally refer to the process in which the card issuer indicates whether a particular credit card is authentic and whether the impending transaction value will cause the cardholder to exceed defined limits 
the terminal electronically records sales draft information  such as the credit card identification number  transaction date  and dollar value of the goods or services purchased 
debit card payments differ slightly from traditional credit card transactions in that the cardholder is required to have sufficient funds available in a deposit account at the time of the transaction  or the debit card transaction will not be authorized 
pin based or on line debit transactions are sent through a debit network  while signature based  off line debit  or check card transactions are sent through card associations and require a signature at the time of purchase 
also  pin based or on line debit transactions typically deduct the purchase amount from the cardholder s deposit account within a day of the purchase  depending on the time of the purchase 
signature based  off line debit  or check card transactions typically debit the cardholder s deposit account two to three days after the purchase  although the funds are held with a memo posted to the cardholder s bank account 
a credit card posts to a cardholder s account  reducing the available credit limit in a similar manner 
after the card and transaction information is captured by the pos device  the terminal automatically either dials a pre programmed phone number or otherwise connects to our network  such as through the internet or a leased line  in order to receive authorization of the transaction 
we route the request to the applicable card association or debit network 
the card association or debit network forwards the authorization request to the card issuer  who determines a response based on the status of the cardholder s account 
the response is returned to the merchant s terminal via the same communication network 
this entire authorization and response process occurs within seconds from the time the merchant swipes the cardholder s card through the pos terminal card reader 
electronic draft capture is the process of transferring sales draft data into an electronic format so that it may be sent through networks for clearing and settlement 
the card associations use a system known as interchange  in the case of credit and check cards  and financial institutions use the debit networks  in the case of debit cards  to transfer the information and funds between the card issuers and us to complete the link between merchants and card issuers 
in order to provide our transaction processing services  we must be designated a certified processor by  and be a merchant service provider of mastercard or an iso of visa 
these designations are dependent upon our being sponsored by member clearing banks of both organizations and our adherence to the standards of the visa and mastercard associations 
as an independent merchant acquirer  we have four financial institution sponsors in the united states and two in canada with whom we have sponsorship or depository and processing agreements 
these agreements allow us to route transactions under the member s bank identification number  or bin  for visa transactions  and interbank card association number  or ica  for mastercard transactions in order to clear credit card transactions through visa and mastercard  respectively 
the member financial institutions of visa and mastercard  some of which are our competitors  set the standards with which we must comply 
funds settlement refers to the process of transferring funds for sales and credits between cardholders and merchants  including the final debiting of a cardholder s account and crediting of a merchant s account for sales transactions 
depending on the type of transaction  either the interchange system or the debit networks are used to transfer the information and funds between the electronic transaction payment processors member sponsor and card issuers  to complete the link between merchants and card issuers 
we use our network telecommunication 
table of contents infrastructure to deliver funding files to our member sponsors  who create a file to fund the merchants over the federal reserve s automated clearing house system in the united states  and the automated clearing settlement system and the large value transfer system in canada 
in our united states portfolio and most of our canadian portfolio except for certain managemed merchant accounts and large accounts  merchant funding primarily occurs after the member receives the funds from the card issuer through the card associations 
for certain of the canadian managed merchant accounts and large accounts  the member funds the merchants before the member receives the net settlement funds from the card associations or interac for debit transactions 
timing differences  interchange expense  and exception items cause differences between the amount the member receives from the card associations and the amount funded to the merchants 
our sponsorship agreement requires the net result  typically called net settlement  to be advanced to the member if the merchant funding obligation exceeds the incoming amount from the card associations  or we temporarily hold the surplus on behalf of the member in a joint deposit account if the opposite occurs 
in practice  we believe independent processors typically participate in the net settlement or surplus  as the member attempts to have no impact in member owned bank accounts at the end of each day 
the member accounts are typically called suspense accounts  which are brought to a zero balance by temporarily transferring surplus funds to or requiring an additional advance to satisfy a deficit from the member sponsored  independent processor 
each participant in the transaction process receives compensation for its services 
as an illustration  on a credit card transaction  the card association may fund the member after retaining a hypothetical referred to as an interchange fee or interchange expense 
the card associations have published more than different interchange expense rate arrangements 
the card issuer seeks reimbursement of from the cardholder in the cardholder s monthly credit card bill 
the member would  in turn  pay the merchant 
the net settlement after this transaction would require us to advance to the member 
after the end of the month  we would bill the merchant a percentage of the transaction  or discount  to cover the full amount of the interchange fee and our net revenue from the transaction 
if our net revenue from the merchant in the above example was basis points  we would bill the merchant at the end of the month for the transaction  reimburse ourselves for approximately in interchange fees and retain as our net revenue for the transaction 
our gross profit on the transaction reflects the net revenue less operating expenses  including the network and systems cost to process the transaction and commissions paid to our sales force or iso 
if it is determined that the merchant in the above transaction is to be placed on reserve or delay  then collateral is held to minimize contingent liabilities to global payments associated with charges properly reversed by cardholders  otherwise known as chargebacks 
this contingent liability arises from our performance guarantee to the member sponsor 
the merchant funds are held as a cash deposit to minimize this risk of loss associated with the transactions processed 
on behalf of the member  global payments holds all or a portion of the deposit for the convenience of the member 
in this situation  the member would net fund global payments  the same amount the member received from the card association 
this amount is comprised of the that would have been funded by the member to the merchant  less the same for the interchange expense 
if a transaction previously processed by global payments through the member is charged back by the cardholder through the card issuer  the member is notified of the shortfall in the anticipated wire 
if the amount of the chargeback is  the member would receive  net from the card association and be required to fund the merchant the same 
therefore  global payments would be required to advance to the member 
this amount is comprised of for the chargeback  plus the same for the interchange expense 
in addition to the card processing services described above  we also process retrieval requests on behalf of merchants for issuing banks and provide chargeback resolution services  both of which relate to cardholders disputing an amount that has been charged to their credit card 
we review the dispute and handle the related exchange of information and funds between the merchant and the card issuer if a charge is to be reversed 
as a result of our financial institution sponsorship and the terms of our standard merchants agreement  our direct 
table of contents merchant services customers are liable for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder 
in the event  however  that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants  due to merchant fraud  insolvency  bankruptcy or any other reason  we may be liable for any such reversed charges 
we utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk 
our risk management services include credit underwriting  credit scoring  fraud control  account processing  and collections 
in addition  we may require cash deposits  guarantees  letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability 
notwithstanding our risk management activities  we have historically experienced some losses due to merchant defaults 
check services our check products offer merchant customers risk management alternatives  in the case of verification and recovery  or risk elimination  in the case of guarantee  by leveraging our internal and external databases of checkwriters to help decide whether the merchant should accept a check as the form of payment from a particular checkwriter 
check guarantee services include comprehensive check verification and guarantee services designed for a merchant s specific needs and risk adversity 
this service offering guarantees payment of all checks that are electronically verified primarily using pos check readers through our extensive databases  which allows merchants to expand their revenue base by applying less stringent requirements when accepting checks from consumers 
if a verified check is dishonored  our check guarantee service generally provides the merchant with reimbursement of the check s face value  and then we pursue collection of the check through our internal collection services 
while we have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter  we have historically recovered less than of the guaranteed checks 
to protect against this risk  we use verification databases that contain information on historical delinquent check writing activity and up to date consumer bank account status 
we derive revenue for these services primarily by charging the merchant a percentage of the face value of each guaranteed check 
check verification and recovery services are similar to those provided in the check guarantee service  except that these services do not guarantee payment of the verified checks 
check verification service provides a low cost loss reduction solution for merchants wishing to quickly measure a customer s check worthiness at the point of sale without incurring the additional expense of check guarantee services 
we provide check recovery service for these customers upon their request 
we derive revenues for these services primarily from the service fees collected from delinquent check writers  fees charged to merchants based on a transaction rate per verified check  and fees charged to merchants for specialized services  such as electronic re deposits of dishonored checks 
in the specialized vertical market of gaming  our vip preferred proprietary software product provides the gaming industry with the tools necessary to establish revolving check cashing limits for the casinos customers 
vip preferred also offers an electronic check option  vip preferred e check  which eliminates the need for paper checks as part of the vip preferred suite of products 
our gaming products allow fast access to cash with high limits so that gaming establishments can increase money to the gaming floors and reduce risk 
we derive revenue from our gaming products primarily based on a percentage of the transaction value 
indirect merchant services through our indirect merchant services business model  we market unbundled products and services primarily to financial institutions and isos that in turn resell our products and their services to their merchants 
the primary service offering in this business model is credit and debit card transaction processing 
these products and services are identical with those offered under our direct merchant services business model 
we primarily perform authorization  electronic draft capture and file transfer services for our indirect merchant services customers 
in addition  we may perform merchant accounting and other back office services 
the primary differences between indirect merchant services credit and debit card transaction processing and direct 
table of contents merchant services relate to funds settlement and financial institution sponsorship 
our indirect merchant services customers perform their own funds settlement and either have their own bin ica or separate financial institution sponsorship 
since we are not party to the financial institution sponsorship  we are not potentially liable for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder 
our merchant accounting services provide information primarily for our indirect merchant services customers to monitor portfolio performance  control expenses  disseminate information  and track profitability through the production and distribution of detailed statements summarizing electronic transaction payment processing activity 
our risk management services allow financial institutions to monitor credit and transaction risk  thereby enhancing the profitability of their merchant portfolios 
our risk management services include credit underwriting  credit scoring  fraud control  account processing  and collections 
in europe  we provide these indirect merchant services through our muzo subsidiary 
consistent with central and eastern european payments processing environment  muzo additionally provides sales  installation  and servicing of atm and pos terminals  and card issuing services 
our card issuing services in europe include card database management and card personalization 
terminal management our terminal management offering supports both our direct and indirect merchant service offerings 
this offering provides a variety of products and services relating to electronic transaction payment processing equipment  such as terminal programming and deployment  set up and telephone training  maintenance and equipment replacement  warehousing and inventory control  customer service  technical support  customized reporting  and conversions 
we provide these services directly to our own portfolio of merchants to support our credit and debit card transaction processing and check services 
we also provide these services indirectly to merchants on behalf of a limited number of our financial institution and independent sales organization customers 
we derive revenue from equipment sales and rentals  programming and deployment fees  and repairs and maintenance services 
money transfer our money transfer product and service offerings include a variety of services such as consumer to consumer and business to business money transfer  financial electronic data interchange  and account balance  management information  and depositing reporting 
for the fiscal year ended may   approximately of our total revenue arose from money transfer services 
consumer to consumer money transfer a majority of the revenue derived from our money transfer offering consists of our consumer to consumer electronic money transfer services marketed under our dolex brand to the growing population of first and second generation latin americans living in the united states 
this consumer segment regularly transfers money to family and friends living in latin america 
following the europhil acquisition  we expanded our money transfer origination locations to europe and our settlement locations to morocco  the philippines  and new destinations in latin america 
we operate over originating retail branch locations in the united states and over in europe  and have settlement arrangements with more than  bank  exchange house and retail locations worldwide 
dolex was founded in  primarily by its current management team 
the consumer to consumer money transfer service offering is primarily driven by transaction levels and unit pricing 
our business strategy is to competitively price our services  provide a timely and quality service  diversify our services through our customer loyalty program and increase our physical presence through additional originating branch locations and expansion into other settlement countries 
we believe this strategy will further expand our customer base and increase our market share 

table of contents in a typical consumer to consumer money transfer transaction  a customer visits one of our originating branch locations and pays a fee based on the nature and amount of the transaction performed on the customer s behalf 
in addition  the customer is quoted a retail exchange rate when the money transfer transaction is requested 
the customer will receive a receipt that includes the amount the beneficiary will receive  the retail exchange rate  money transfer fee  settlement location and total amount that was remitted to dolex 
once the transaction is completed at the originating branch location  for recipients in mexico  our call center contacts the beneficiary to provide an identification number  settlement location  and the amount to enable the recipient to claim the money transferred in its name 
we earn additional revenue based on the difference between the retail exchange rate that is quoted and the wholesale exchange rate when the currency is purchased in much larger denominations than the individual customer s transaction 
each business day  we determine the amount of currency needed to settle daily  bid the wholesale exchange rates based on the amount needed and purchase currency at the best available rates 
business to business money transfer our business to business money transfer products and services also provide financial  management and operational data to financial institutions  corporations and government agencies worldwide and allow these organizations to exchange the information with financial institutions and other service providers 
we also provide edi tax filing and internet tax payment services that allow financial institutions and government agencies to offer corporate taxpayers a secure and convenient method of paying taxes electronically 
tax payment security is handled through both ssl encryption decryption and multi level password access and operates through a web site that serves as the portal for securely receiving tax information and delivering the transaction for payment 
our business to business money transfer services are primarily priced based on a rate per transaction processed 
employees as of may   we and our subsidiaries had approximately  employees 
many of our employees are highly skilled in technical areas specific to electronic transaction payment processing and money transfer 
we believe that our current and future operations depend substantially on retaining our key technical employees 
competition merchant services our primary competitors in the electronic transaction payment processing industry include other merchant acquirers  as well as major national and regional financial institution processors and isos  some of which are our customers 
certain of these companies are privately held  and the majority of those that are publicly held do not release the information necessary to precisely quantify our relative competitive position 
as an independent merchant acquirer  our principal affiliation with financial institutions relates to the sponsorship that enables our access to the card associations and debit networks 
we believe an independent merchant acquirer  such as global payments  will tend to be more of an advocate for the merchant customer  as there is no other relationship with a card issuing business or cardholder customer service  which is typical of a financial institution processor 
also  a financial institution processor sales channel is primarily based on referrals within the institution  to further leverage a customer relationship  while an independent processor or iso will tend to be focused on sales from all channels  including internally generated leads 
finally  a financial institution processor may not have the same executive focus on a merchant acquiring business  as the business is generally not core to the total revenues of the financial institution 
we primarily differ from isos in that we have our own processing platform and financial institution sponsorship agreements 
based on industry publications such as the nilson report  dated april  we are a leading  mid market merchant acquirer in the united states 
according to that report  one of our competitors  first data corporation and its affiliates  is the largest electronic transaction payment processor in the united states 

table of contents our primary competitor in canada is moneris solutions  which we believe has a slightly larger share of the canadian merchant acquirer s market based on transactions processed 
moneris solutions is a joint investment of the royal bank of canada and the bank of montreal 
however  we believe that we are the largest publicly traded independent processor in canada 
we service all industry segments and specialize in the direct merchant services  mid market segment in the united states and the large and mid market segments in canada 
we define mid market as a merchant with an average of  to  in annual visa and or mastercard volume 
many of our iso relationships provide merchant referrals in the small market segment  with average annual visa and or mastercard volumes below  national accounts or large market merchants that we serve average between million to million in annual visa and or mastercard volume 
our primary strategy to distinguish ourselves from our competitors focuses on offering a variety of electronic transaction payment processing solutions to our customers 
these enhanced services involve vertical market and sophisticated reporting features that add value to the information obtained from our electronic transaction payment processing databases 
we believe that our knowledge of these specific markets  the size and effectiveness of our dedicated sales force  affiliations with trade associations  agent banks and caps  our ability to offer specific  integrated solutions to our customers  including hardware  software  processing  and network facilities  and our flexibility in packaging these products are positive factors that enhance our competitive position 
money transfer our primary competitors in the consumer to consumer money transfer business are more diversified with a broader international reach 
we believe our service offering ranks fourth in dollar volume transferred from the united states to latin america 
in addition  many of our competitors use agency agreements with third parties at the point of sale to collect funds and input transaction data 
we generally use a fixed cost  branch owned model at the point of sale rather than a variable cost  agent based model 
we believe this model enhances our growth strategy  as higher transaction levels may provide significant future leverage 
the most significant competitive factors relating to our consumer to consumer money transfer offering include customer service  quality  value added features  functionality  price  reliability  the breadth and effectiveness of our distribution channel  and the manner in which we deliver our services 
these competitive factors will continue to change as new distribution channels and alternative payment solutions are developed by our competitors and us 
for instance  we believe the electronic money transfer offerings may evolve from a cash based solution to a card based solution at the origination and settlement points in the transaction process 
our ability to effectively compete in the marketplace depends on our ability to adapt to these technological and competitive advancements 
we believe our knowledge of the industry  our relative size  and our branch owned model gives us an advantage over our competitors when adapting to these changes 
industry overview and target markets industry overview payment processing service providers provide high volume electronic transaction payment processing and support services directly to financial institutions  merchants  and independent sales organizations 
generally  the payment processing market in the united states and canada continues to transition from traditional financial institution providers to independent merchant acquirers  such as global payments 
we believe merchants seek more efficient distribution channels  as well as increased technological capabilities required for the rapid and efficient creation  processing  handling  storage  and retrieval of information 
in europe  financial institutions remain the dominant provider of payment processing services to merchants  although the outsourcing of back end processing services to third party service providers is becoming more prevalent 
throughout all markets  processing services have become increasingly complex  requiring significant capital commitments to develop  maintain and update the systems necessary to provide these advanced services at a competitive price 

table of contents global payments also provides electronic money transfer services to consumers in the united states and europe sending money to latin america  morocco  and the philippines 
unlike our major competitors in the latin american corridor that operate an agent based network  we generally utilize a branch owned network strategy at the point of sale 
we believe that this differentiation allows us to be more flexible and competitive when setting our prices and introducing new products and services 
as a result of continued growth in our industry  several large merchant acquirers  including us  have expanded operations both domestically and internationally 
this expansion has come in the form of acquisitions  and the creation of alliances and joint ventures 
we believe that the electronic payment transaction processing and money transfer industries will continue to consolidate as banks and independent processors that do not have the necessary infrastructure to participate in a highly competitive environment look to exit the business 
visa  through its member banks  has announced that it will begin offering cards containing chip technology in canada 
chip technology can securely store and encrypt confidential information 
the chip is difficult to copy and has the power to be programmed with spending and usage limits  making it possible to authorize transactions off line 
chip technology will enable a host of additional features including applications such as loyalty  access control  rewards  and public transit passes 
we expect that it will take up to five years for all participants to implement the equipment necessary to accept and process the chip card compliant transactions in the canadian marketplace 
we have been working to develop a long term plan to ensure our merchants will benefit from the migration to chip technology in the canadian market 
we believe the number of electronic transactions will continue to grow in the future and that an increasing percentage of these transactions will be processed through emerging technologies 
to help our customers reduce their transaction costs and speed up the transaction approval process  we have integrated new technologies into our service offerings such as internet protocol communications and check truncation or conversion at the point of sale 
as new technologies like radio frequency identification or contactless payment card continue to evolve  we plan to develop new products and services that will exploit the benefits that these new technologies can offer our customers 
we also believe that new emerging markets will continue to develop in areas that have been previously dominated by paper based transactions 
industries such as quick service restaurants  government  recurring payments  and business to business  should continue to see transaction volumes migrate to more electronic based settlement solutions 
we believe that the continued development of new products and services and the emergence of new vertical markets will be a significant factor in the growth of our business for the foreseeable future 
target markets we believe that significant global opportunities exist for continued growth in the application of electronic transaction payment processing and money transfer services 
although the united states accounts for the largest payment processing volume in the world  global expansion by financial institutions into new geographies and the increased recognition by governments of the ability of payment cards to facilitate economic growth  is rapidly transforming the electronic commerce market into a global payments opportunity 
additionally  positive migration trends led by the rapid globalization of the economy are also leading the way for increased electronic money transfer opportunities 
the rapid growth of retail credit card transactions  as well as the increased utilization of debit cards  directly correlates with the historic growth of our business 
according to the nilson report dated march worldwide annual visa and mastercard purchase volume increased to over trillion in in the united states  the nilson report dated february estimates that more than trillion of annual consumer spending is charged using visa and mastercard cards  a trillion  or  increase from its february estimate of trillion 
based on figures reported in the nilson report dated june  we also believe that over billion us of annual canadian consumer spending uses visa  mastercard or debit as the form of payment  representing an increase of billion us  or  from the prior year estimate of billion 
in europe  credit card utilization remains underdeveloped relative to the two most developed credit markets in the world  the united states and united kingdom 
according to a report by lafferty  if european 
table of contents spending patterns grew to half of the penetration rate and spending levels of the united states market  there would be an billion credit card processing volume opportunity for our industry 
equally as attractive has been the increase in the number of international immigrants  which the united nations population division estimates has increased from million in to million at the end of the world bank estimates that billion was remitted worldwide in with over of the volume originating in the united states 
in march  the pew hispanic center estimated that approximately million latin american immigrants reside within the united states 
according to a march report released by the inter american development bank  the expected value of electronic money transfer remittances to the latin american market in calendar was estimated to be almost billion 
strategy in pursuing our business strategy  we seek to increase our penetration in existing markets  expand into new geographic regions as represented by our acquisition of muzo in the czech republic  and expand into new payment areas as represented by our acquisitions of dolex and europhil in the electronic money transfer service industry 
we believe that this strategy provides us with the greatest opportunity to expand our existing business  leverage our existing infrastructure  and maintain a consistent base of recurring revenues  thereby maximizing shareholder equity and acquisition returns on investment 
we intend to accomplish this overall strategy as follows existing offerings in pursuing this business strategy  we intend to increase our penetration of existing markets and to further leverage our infrastructure 
our objectives to execute this strategy include the following expand distribution channels  primarily direct merchant services  isos  and caps  provide the best possible customer service at levels that exceed our competitors by investing in technology  training and product enhancements  grow our direct merchant services  domestic and canadian market share by concentrating on the mid market segment in the united states and on the small and mid market segments in canada  grow our consumer to consumer money transfer customer base and market share by expanding our branch locations and offering competitive pricing  provide the latest  secure  enhanced products and services by developing value added applications  enhancing existing products  and developing new systems and services to blend technology with our customer needs  and focus on potential domestic and international acquisitions or investments and alliances with companies that have high growth and operate in profitable sectors of payments related industries through compatible products and services  development capabilities and distribution capabilities 
international markets we intend to focus on further diversification in international markets with geographic areas of payments industry growth  such as latin america  europe and the asia pacific region 
we are evaluating these markets due to the following attractive characteristics currently low but growing credit and debit card utilization  money transfer opportunities  the absence of a dominant merchant acquirer or processor  and potential to satisfy our acquisition strategy

banking regulations as of may   the canadian imperial bank of commerce  or cibc  owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result of cibc s equity interest in our company  we are considered a subsidiary of cibc for us bank regulatory purposes 
cibc is a canadian bank with operations in the united states 
accordingly  cibc is regulated in the us as a foreign bank and  as a result  is subject to most of the same limitations as a us bank holding company under provisions of the bank holding company act 
as a subsidiary of cibc for us bank regulatory purposes  we are subject to those same regulations 
we are also subject to examination by the federal reserve board 
as a general matter  we are able to operate our merchant services and money transfer businesses as we have historically  but our ability to expand into unrelated businesses may be limited unless they are permitted activities under the bank holding company act or the federal reserve board otherwise approves such activities 
bank holding companies may engage in the business of banking  managing and controlling banks  and in other activities so closely related to managing and controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
the gramm leach bliley act  enacted in  amended the bank holding company act to allow greater operational flexibility for bank holding companies whose us depository institution subsidiaries are well capitalized  well managed and meet certain other conditions 
such companies are referred to as financial holding companies 
a foreign bank also may qualify as a financial holding company if it as well as any foreign bank affiliate that maintains a us branch  agency  or commercial lending company is well capitalized and well managed 
financial holding companies may engage in activities that are financial in nature  or that are incidental or complementary to financial activities 
the legislation defines securities and insurance activities as being permissible financial activities  allows certain merchant banking activities  and establishes a procedure for the federal reserve board  together with the us treasury department  to announce additional permissible activities 
as a foreign bank  cibc may qualify for financial holding company status and has done so 
if a financial holding company falls out of compliance with the requirements of the gramm leach bliley act  it must enter into an agreement with the federal reserve board to rectify the situation 
the federal reserve board may refuse to allow the financial holding company  which would include its subsidiaries  to engage in new financial activities may require it to cease current financial activities and may require it to divest its banking business altogether 
the merchant services and money transfer businesses that we conduct are permissible activities for bank holding companies as well as financial holding companies under us law  and we do not expect the limitations described above to adversely affect our current operations 
it is possible  however  that these restrictions might limit our ability to enter other businesses that we may wish to engage in at some time in the future 
it is also possible that these laws may be amended in the future  or new laws or regulations may be adopted  which could adversely affect our ability to engage in our current or additional businesses 

table of contents additionally  cibc is subject to the bank act canada  which  among other things  limits the types of business which cibc may conduct  directly or indirectly  and the types of investments which cibc may make 
cibc s shareholding in our company is currently permitted under the bank act 
under the bank act  cibc is permitted to continue to hold its interest in us  as long as the business undertaken by us is consistent with the applicable provisions of the bank act 
if we undertake businesses inconsistent with the businesses in which cibc is permitted to hold an interest  cibc may be required  pursuant to the provisions of the bank act  to dispose of its shares 
we have agreed with cibc  in effect  that we will not undertake any business inconsistent with the applicable provisions of the bank act 
we do not anticipate that compliance with this undertaking will affect  in any material way  our ability to carry on the merchant services and money transfer businesses 
our ability to expand into other businesses will be governed by the undertaking and the applicable provisions of canadian banking legislation at the relevant time 
the office of the superintendent of financial institutions canada  or osfi  has ruled that it considers the provision of our consumer electronic money transfer business  albeit conducted outside of canada  to be a business that is to a significant extent the business of banking and that we are therefore a foreign bank as defined in the bank act 
following receipt of this osfi ruling  we applied for and received an exemption order which exempts us from most of the foreign bank provisions of the bank act 
as a result of receiving this exemption order  we do not believe that osfi s determination that we are a foreign bank under the bank act will affect  in any material way  our ability to carry on the merchant services and money transfer businesses in canada or to expand into other non banking businesses 
however  there is no assurance that subsequent amendments to the bank act would not adversely affect our ability to carry on our business in canada as it is conducted today 
except as discussed above  the bank act does not otherwise apply to us 
money transfer licensing and regulations the company is subject to various us federal  state and foreign laws and regulations governing money transmission and the sale of payment instruments  such as official checks and money orders 
in the united states  most states license consumer money transfer service providers and issuers of money orders such as dolex 
the applicable state statutes and regulations typically require dolex to obtain and maintain certain required licenses as a condition to performing these activities 
these statutes and regulations generally require dolex to a satisfy minimum net worth requirements  b procure and maintain a surety bond with minimum statutory levels of coverage  c demonstrate the character and fitness of the officers and directors of dolex  and d subject itself to periodic financial audits 
the consumer to consumer money transfer service offering also is subject to regulation by various agencies of the federal government that are charged with implementing and enforcing anti money laundering laws and regulations  including the bank secrecy act  as amended by the usa patriot act of collectively  the bsa

global payments european money transfer companies collectively  europhil are regulated by various governmental agencies in spain  belgium  and the united kingdom in their money transfer activities 
prior to its acquisition by global payments  europhil received approval from these governmental agencies to act as a money transfer service provider 
these governmental agencies generally require europhil to a satisfy minimum share capital requirements  b periodically submit information regarding financial results  changes in corporate documentation or ownership  insurance  and other relevant information  c register and maintain transaction

these regulations may include limitations on what types of entities may offer money transfer services  limitations on the amount of principal that can be moved into or out of a country  limitations on the number of money transfers that may be received by a customer  limitations on the exchange rates between foreign currencies  and regulations intended to help detect and prevent money laundering 
our use of a branch network for the origination of electronic money transfers rather than an agent model typically utilized by our larger competitors allows greater control of our regulatory compliance in each origination and settlement jurisdiction 
dolex and europhil have developed compliance programs to monitor regulatory requirements and developments and to implement policies and procedures to help satisfy these requirements 
foreign and domestic governments may impose new or additional rules on money transfers and sales of payment instruments  including regulations which i prohibit transactions in  to or from certain countries  governments  nationals and individuals and entities  ii impose additional identification  reporting or recordkeeping requirements  iii limit the entities capable of providing money transfer services and sales of payment instruments  iv limit or restrict the revenue which may be generated from money transfers  including revenue derived from foreign exchange  v require additional consumer disclosures  or vi limit the number or principal amount of money transfers which may be sent to or from the jurisdiction
