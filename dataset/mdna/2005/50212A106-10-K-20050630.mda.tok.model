these solutions enable our customers to manage the entire life cycle of an individual s identity for a variety of applications including civil identification  criminal identification and border management 
our customers use our solutions to help solve the following three critical problems in identity verification and management assurance that the identification document is authentic and has been issued to the correct person  confidence that the person holding the identification is uniquely tied to and authorized to use the document  and verification of the privileges the individual is entitled to at a particular point in time 
our solutions annually produce more than million secure government issued credentials at more than  locations 
we are the second largest provider of us drivers licenses with a market share  and we are the sole source provider of passport production capability to the us department of state 
we also are a recognized leader in biometrics in the field of face recognition 
in addition  we are the leader in document authentication technology with approximately  installations in countries 
our customers include governments  law enforcement agencies and businesses around the world 
recent strategic initiatives the market for identity solutions has continued to develop at a rapid pace over the past months 
in particular  consumers of identity solutions are demanding end to end solutions with increased functionality that can solve their spectrum of needs across the identity life cycle 
we have addressed these developments through  among other things  through four important initiatives that we began in  including the acquisition of zn vision technologies ag  or zn  a german provider of face recognition and computer vision products  which we completed in january  and which has resulted in a substantial enhancement to our biometrics technologies and research and development capabilities  the february acquisition of trans digital technologies corporation  or tdt  the sole source provider of us high technology solutions for the production of passports for the us department of state  which enabled us to win a contract to provide production capability for the common access card  or cac  smart card program to the us department of state  
table of contents the acquisition of imaging automation  inc  or ia  the worldwide market leader in document authentication  which we completed in october  and which has supplemented our installed customer base  significantly expanded our distribution channels  and provided us with a high value entr e into new markets  and the creation of a products group  consisting of product marketing  product management  sales and business development personnel and headed by an experienced sales executive  which focuses on driving sales of our products to our worldwide customer base and increasing product sales as a percentage of our overall net sales 
financial results we generate revenue through the sale and license of products and services for verifying and managing identities 
our revenues increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december   due in large part to the acquisitions described in the preceding paragraph 
revenue is derived from multi year contracts for systems implementation  credential production and related services as well as from solution sales to law enforcement agencies  the federal government  foreign governments and the gaming industry 
our net loss for was million 
capital raising initiatives and repayment of indebtedness in august  we sold approximately million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the offering 
during  we repaid in full a million promissory note that we had issued to buddy beck  a director of viisage and the former sole shareholder of tdt in connection with our acquisition of tdt 
million of the note was repaid in cash and the remaining million was settled as an offset against a purchase price reduction negotiated as part of the acquisition of tdt 
in addition  in  we repaid in full our million debt obligation to lau technologies  or lau  one of our principal stockholders 
finally  in  we repaid million representing the outstanding principal balance under our loan agreement with commerce bank and trust company which was subsequently terminated 
in december  we entered into a new loan agreement with a commercial lender which permits us to borrow up to  subject to certain financial covenants which may restrict the amounts borrowed 
certain of these covenants were amended in march no borrowings have been made under this agreement to date other than million in letters of credit issued by citizens to certain of our customers 
we expect our current capital resources to be adequate for our needs for at least the next months 
however  if we enter into a new drivers license contract or engage in a significant acquisition or other strategic transaction  we could be required to raise additional capital  either in the form of debt or equity 
acquisitions in january  we acquired all outstanding shares of zn in exchange for an aggregate of  newly issued shares of our common stock and in cash 
in addition  we assumed zn s employee share option plan  and accordingly have reserved  shares of our common stock for issuance to the plan participants 
the options under this plan were fully vested prior to the close of the transaction 
in february  we acquired all outstanding shares of tdt in exchange for  newly issued shares of our common stock  million in cash and million in notes  which have subsequently been repaid in full 
in october  we completed the acquisition of ia 
the purchase price for the acquisition included approximately million shares of common stock  approximately million in cash and the assumption of approximately million of debt  which has subsequently been repaid in full 
in addition  we issued fully vested stock options effective as of the close of the transaction to assume ia s employee stock option plans  and accordingly have reserved  shares of our common stock for issuance to the plans participants 

table of contents litigation in march and april  eight putative class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against us  bernard c 
bailey  william k 
aulet and denis k 
berube and other members of our board of directors 
the suits allege violations of the federal securities laws by us and certain of our officers and directors arising out of purported misrepresentations in the guidance that we provided on our anticipated financial results for fiscal following the release of our second and third quarter results  which allegedly artificially inflated the price of our stock during the period may  through march  we are not able to estimate the amount of the loss allegedly suffered by members of the putative class or the amount of legal costs and internal efforts associated with defending ourselves and our officers and directors 
in december  a georgia court granted summary judgment in favor of georgia s department of motor vehicle safety  or dmvs  in connection with litigation brought by one of our competitors in march alleging that the dmvs did not comply with its own bid process when it selected viisage as the vendor for its new digital drivers license program 
as a result of the judge s ruling  in the fourth quarter of  we took a non cash write down of million for an impairment charge to assets then on our balance sheet 
our appeal of this ruling to the georgia supreme court was dismissed on procedural grounds in may in may  viisage  toppan printing co  ltd 
and fargo electronics  inc agreed to a settlement of the patent infringement lawsuit fargo had filed against toppan and tdt in july in a us federal court in virginia 
a complete description of the above matters is provided under item  legal proceedings 
segments and geographic information our business operates in one business segment  the advanced technology identity solutions segment 
during the fourth quarter of we realigned our net product and services revenues into three main categories identified by the markets which they serve state and local  federal  and commercial emerging markets 
our chief executive officer is the chief operating decision maker who evaluates performance based on revenues and total operating expenses of identity solutions products and services across all markets and geographic regions 
for the year ended december   we generated approximately  or million   or million  and  or  of our total revenue from customers in the state and local  federal  and commercial emerging markets  respectively 
for the year ended december   we generated approximately  or million   or million  and  or  of our total revenue from customers in state and local  federal  and commercial emerging markets  respectively 
for the year ended december   we derived  or million  of our direct revenue within the united states 
we derived an additional  or million  of our direct revenue in international markets 
of the million of international sales  approximately million was derived by our german subsidiary  primarily from customers in countries within the european union 
for the year ended december   approximately million  or of our direct revenue was derived within the united states 
the remaining  or of revenue was derived internationally 
dependence on significant customers we believe for the near future that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large contracts 
customers who accounted for more than of our total revenues are as follows for the year ended december   two customers accounted for an aggregate of  for the year ended december   two customers accounted for an aggregate of  and for the year ended december   two customers accounted for an aggregate of 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or us gaap 
consistent with us gaap  we have adopted accounting policies that we believe are most appropriate given the facts and circumstances of our business 
the application of these policies has a significant impact on our reported results 
in addition  some of these policies require management to make estimates 
these estimates  which are based on historical experience and analysis of current conditions  have a significant impact on our reported results and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived and intangible assets our long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  other intangible assets and goodwill 
as of december   the balances of property  plant and equipment  other intangible assets and goodwill  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  were million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   the balances of property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  were million and million  respectively 
where we believe that property  plant and equipment and intangible assets have finite lives  we depreciate and amortize those assets over their estimated useful lives 
for purposes of determining whether there are any impairment losses  as further discussed below  our management has examined the carrying value of our identifiable long lived tangible and intangible assets  including their useful lives where we believe such assets have finite lives  when indicators of impairment are present 
for all long lived tangible and intangible assets  if an impairment loss were identified based on the fair value of the asset  as compared to the carrying value of the asset  such loss would be charged to expense in the period we identify the impairment 
furthermore  based on our review of the carrying values of the long lived tangible and intangible assets with finite lives  we may determine that shorter estimated useful lives are more appropriate 
in that event  we will be required to record depreciation and amortization over fewer future periods  which will reduce our earnings 
factors we generally consider important which could trigger an impairment review on the carrying value of other long lived tangible and intangible assets include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  underutilization of our tangible assets  discontinuance of product lines by ourselves or our customers  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
although we believe that the carrying values of our long lived tangible and intangible assets were realizable as of december   future events could cause us to conclude otherwise 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to a write down of certain system assets associated with our contract to produce drivers licenses in the state of georgia 
this impairment was the result of a georgia court s grant of summary judgment  during that quarter  in favor of georgia s department of motor vehicle safety  or dmvs  in connection with litigation brought by one of our competitors in march alleging that the dmvs did not comply with its own bid process when it selected viisage as the vendor for its new digital drivers license program 
the summary judgment negated a prior settlement between us and the state that would have provided us with a payment of million upon the 
table of contents cancellation of its contract 
due to the uncertainty of the cash settlement as a result of the judge s ruling and the uncertainty of future cash flows from this contract to support the book value of certain system assets installed  we have identified million of assets deployed within the state that we have deemed to have no alternative use 
we reduced the recorded value of these assets from approximately million to their estimated fair value of approximately  based on our estimate of realizable value from liquidation of these assets  which resulted in a million charge in the fourth quarter of we also have evaluated for impairment the remaining million in assets being retained by us from the georgia contract 
these consist of approximately million of assets that we anticipate using in georgia if we win the contract based on the new request for proposals  approximately  of assets that we anticipate could either be used in georgia under a new contract or used in other projects  and approximately million of assets constituting our central production facility in georgia 
based upon our current probability weighted estimate of cash flows  we have determined that these assets are not currently impaired 
while we believe we can utilize these assets either in georgia  if we win the new contract  or on alternative projects  to the extent that we are unable to utilize these assets or realize value through a sale of these assets or reach a new settlement with dmvs regarding these assets  we would be required to take a further charge to earnings 
due to our three acquisitions in  goodwill and other intangible assets were created as a result of the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired businesses 
the values recorded for goodwill and other intangible assets represent estimates of fair values calculated by independent third party appraisers and are subject to further review and finalization 
such valuations require us to provide significant estimates and assumptions  which are derived from information obtained from the management of the acquired businesses  and our business plans for the acquired businesses or intellectual property 
critical estimates and assumptions used in the initial valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets include  but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales  customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to complete any in process research and development projects and commercialize viable products and estimated cash flows from sales of such products  the acquired companies brand awareness and market position  assumptions about the period of time over which we will continue to use the acquired brand  and discount rates 
these estimates and assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate because unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
if estimates and assumptions used to initially value goodwill and intangible assets prove to be inaccurate  ongoing reviews of the carrying values of such goodwill and intangible assets may indicate impairment which will require us to record an impairment charge in the period in which we identify the impairment 
we follow statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual tests in certain circumstances  and to write down goodwill when impaired 
these events or circumstances generally would include the occurrence of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the asset 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using the two step process as prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  a second step must be followed to calculate impairment 
otherwise  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  the goodwill is not considered to be impaired as of the measurement date 
we performed the initial step by comparing the fair value of our reporting units as determined by considering a number of factors  including an independent valuation that assessed the fair value of viisage based on a comparison of us to comparable firms using the guideline company method and comparable transaction method 
we also considered future discounted cash flows as compared to the carrying amount to assess the recoverability of the goodwill asset 
based upon these tests  we determined that the fair value exceeded the carrying amount resulting in no impairment 
if impairment had occurred  any excess of carrying value over fair value would have been recorded as an impairment charge 

table of contents revenue and cost recognition we deliver document issuance solutions primarily to federal and state government customers 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery occurs or services are rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product revenue on contracts where title to the products passes to the customer mainly consists of sales of printing system components and consumables including printers  secure coating  ribbon  film  document authentication products and other parts 
revenue on products is recognized when the products are accepted by the customer 
services revenue under these contracts consists of maintenance services on our installed base of printing systems and document authentication products 
we also provide on site technical support and consulting services to customers primarily in the federal government marketplace 
revenue on fixed price services is recognized over the service period and approximates the timing of the services rendered 
revenue on time and material services is recognized as the services are rendered 
expenses on all services are recognized when the costs are incurred 
during the third quarter of  we adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf  on a cumulative basis as of january  eitf governs how to determine whether separate units of accounting exist in a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables and  if so  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among separate units of accounting 
the operating results for the year ended december  reflect the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle in which was a non cash charge of million 
when elements such as products and services are contained in a single arrangement  or in related arrangements with the same customer  we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value  provided that such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
the price charged when the element is sold separately generally determines fair value 
we have contracts  generally with state governments for the production of drivers licenses and other identification credentials  where we have determined that we have multiple elements and where the title to equipment installed to produce these credentials does not pass to the customer 
under these contracts  the first element consists of hardware  system design  implementation  training  consumables management  maintenance and support which is accounted for as equipment and related executory services under lease in accordance with sfas no 
the second element consists of customized software which is accounted for as a long term contract in accordance with aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  sop  and statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  sop  on a units of delivery method of measurement 
costs related to the hardware element of these contracts are capitalized on the balance sheet and are depreciated over the contract term beginning when the system goes into service 
the delivery of these credentials typically requires us to customize  design  and install equipment and software at customer locations  as well as perform training  supply consumables  maintain the equipment and provide support services 
nonperformance of training  consumables management  maintenance and support services would prevent receipt of payment for the costs incurred in the customization  design and installation of the system 
eitf limits the amount of revenue allocable to the customization  design and installation of the system to the amount that is not contingent upon the production of credentials 
revenue on these contracts under eitf is earned based on  and is contingent upon  the production of credentials from the system 
due to the contingent performance of credential production in secure credentials contracts  defers revenue recognition for the system design and installation phase of such contracts  including customized software and equipment  and recognizes revenue as credentials are produced 
costs related to the customized software used in drivers license contracts are capitalized on the balance sheet during the period in which we are designing and installing the system and are amortized over the contract 
table of contents term beginning when the system goes into service 
revenue related to our drivers license contracts are recorded as credentials are produced by the system 
our contracts related to the delivery of drivers licenses and identification credentials typically provide that the state department of transportation  or similar agency  will pay a fixed price per credential produced utilizing a system we design  implement and support 
our fixed pricing includes charges for the use of the system  materials and the data that is stored on the credentials 
prices under these contracts vary depending on  among other things design and integration complexities  nature and number of workstations and sites installed  projected number of secure credentials to be produced  size of the database  level of post installation involvement that will be required of us  and competitive environment 
other identity solutions contracts typically provide for the development  customization and installation of face recognition systems for government agencies  law enforcement agencies and businesses 
these contracts are generally on a fixed price basis  and include milestones and acceptance criteria for the various deliverables under the contract 
contract prices vary depending on  among other things  design and integration complexities  the nature and number of workstations and sites  the size of the database  the level of post installation support and the competitive environment 
in certain cases  we provide licenses of off the shelf versions of its face recognition software on a per user basis 
we recognize revenue under these contracts using the percentage of completion methodology in accordance with sop we uses the percentage of completion methodology to account for revenue under these contracts because a high level of certainty exists regarding expected cash flows from these contracts  and a reliable basis exists for estimating the percentage of the contract that will be completed at the end of the accounting period 
we measure the percentage complete as costs are incurred or based on milestones 
these milestones are specific events or deliverables clearly identified in the contract and can include customized systems  installation and services as defined by the contract 
when milestone measures are used  billings occur and revenue is recognized when scheduled performance milestones and customer acceptance criteria have been achieved 
we recognize revenue based on the total milestone billable to the customer less revenue related to any future maintenance requirements 
billings occur under these contracts when the milestone is delivered and accepted by the customer 
on contracts where milestones are not used  we generally recognize revenue on a cost to cost basis using direct labor dollars as the method of measurement 
we record costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings under these contracts as current assets 
when elements such as products and services are contained in a single arrangement  or in related arrangements with the same customer  we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value  provided that such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
the price charged when the element is sold separately generally determines fair value 
revenue related to software licenses of off the shelf face recognition software is recognized in accordance with sop for these software licenses we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  
table of contents the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection is probable  and post delivery obligations have established fair values 
on identity solutions contracts where the arrangement consists of build to suit software and solution design during the installation phase of the project  as well as ongoing services under a long term contract  we apply the criteria in eitf to separate the sop deliverables  the installation services  from the non sop deliverables  ongoing maintenance and support services 
on these contracts we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value  provided that such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
the price charged when the element is sold separately generally determines fair value 
income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of net deferred tax assets  we have provided a full valuation allowance against this amount 
we had a deferred income tax provision in of  to record the deferred tax liability related to tax deductible amortization of certain goodwill 
this deferred tax liability is created by taxable temporary differences related to certain goodwill for which the period the difference will reverse is indefinite 
following the adoption of sfas  taxable temporary differences creating deferred tax liabilities as a result of different treatment of goodwill for book and tax purposes cannot offset deductible temporary differences that create deferred tax assets in determining the valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of  we made an election under internal revenue tax code section h to treat the acquisition of tdt as an asset transaction for tax purposes 
this election resulted in tax deductible amortization expense related to certain goodwill for tax purposes 
as a result  a deferred tax provision was required to record the deferred tax liability of tax deductible goodwill amortization 
there was no provision for federal income taxes for the years ended december  or due to the net losses in those years 
comprehensive income loss in accordance with sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  we report accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets 
comprehensive income loss includes net income loss and other comprehensive income loss  which includes current period foreign currency translation adjustments 
the accumulated other comprehensive income loss consists of unrealized translation losses in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translations 
we had  of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of december  there were no components of other comprehensive income loss for the years ended december  and stock based compensation we account for our employees stock based compensation plans under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  utilizing the intrinsic value method 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  established a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation plans 
the company has adopted the disclosure only alternative under sfas no 
for its employees stock based compensation awards  which requires disclosure of the pro forma effects on net loss and net loss per share as if sfas no 
had been adopted as well as certain other information 

table of contents results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended december  and consolidated performance net loss for the year ended december  was million or 
per basic and diluted share compared to million or per basic and diluted share for the prior year  including the one time charge of million in connection with our change in accounting principle as of january  the increase in net loss from the prior year  excluding the impact of the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  was primarily attributable to the write down of million for an impairment charge to assets related to our georgia drivers license contract  other expense related to foreign currency losses of  increases in interest expense of  and tax expenses of approximately  as we experienced a decrease in our loss from operations for the year ended december  of approximately  or an operating loss of million compared to million for the year ended december  in we anticipate that improved margins and continued focus on controlling operating costs will improve our operating results 
we plan to implement strategies to continue to monitor our operating expenses and to reduce other losses from foreign currency transactions which we expect will improve our operating results 
revenue we generate revenue through the sale and license of products and services for verifying and managing identities 
our revenues increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december   which includes increases resulting from the zn  tdt and ia acquisitions 
the increase was the result of approximately million related to our delivery under our contract to deliver passports to the us department of state and other services contracts  approximately million from the us department of defense procurement of printing systems and consumables for its common access card  or cac  program  approximately million from new contracts won to deliver solutions to state government customers as well as technology upgrades to installed systems in some states and credential volume increases in many states where we produce drivers licenses  approximately million from the delivery of new biometrically enabled identity solutions projects to primarily state government customers  approximately million related to international sales of face recognition solutions  and approximately  from document authentication product and services sales 
we experienced increases in card volume in ten states resulting in approximately million of additional revenue in we also signed extensions in two states contributing an additional million of revenue and completed technology upgrades in three states for an additional  of revenue in these increases related to our deployed drivers license solutions were offset by reduced revenue in four states of approximately  related to price decreases and reduced card volume 
the system deliveries related to the cac procurement were substantially complete by december  and we expect to provide consumables and support services in the future 
other identity solutions revenue was offset by legacy contracts entering the maintenance phase resulting in a decrease in revenue of approximately million from the prior year 
in addition  we generated million less revenue from one federally funded face recognition contract in gross margin gross margin improved by to for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
the improvement in gross margin is attributable to the introduction of higher margin products and 
table of contents solutions to our product mix through acquisitions and new contracts 
our international sales contributed revenue with gross margins of between and for our us federal contracts contributed revenue with gross margins in excess of related to its contracts which includes in its cost of goods sold the significant amortization of intangible asset expense described in the next paragraph 
document authentication products  starting in the fourth quarter of  contributed revenue with gross margins of approximately 
in addition to the change in product mix related to our acquisitions of zn  tdt and ia  the increase in card volume in many states and our sales of technology upgrades to some of our drivers license customers in  as well as improved cost management in executing these contracts  resulted in gross margin improvement of approximately from this customer base 
in  we believe that by changing our product mix to include more sales of higher margin products  services and solutions  we will be able to further improve our gross margin performance 
for the year ended december   we have allocated approximately million of amortization expense for the tdt acquisition to cost of sales due to the fact that a majority of the identified intangible assets were attributed to contracts that are generating significant revenue 
for the year ended december   we have allocated approximately  of expense to cost of goods  representing amortization expense in the fourth quarter of from the ia acquisition related to acquired contracts and technology preliminarily identified as intangible assets in that transaction 
non cash amortization expense related to identified intangible assets from these transactions will be continue to be allocated to cost of sales which we expect will continue to negatively impact our gross margins in the future 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased approximately million  from million in for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to sales and marketing expenses related to the acquisitions of approximately million 
the remaining increase related to our investment in pursuing opportunities to deliver solutions that incorporate our total identity solutions capabilities to our customers with a heightened focus on federal programs 
as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  in we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as a percentage of sales as we continue to target opportunities in both the federal and state marketplaces 
associated with the acquisition of ia in  we have increased our focus on product management and anticipate that these additional product development and product management resources will help to expand our product offerings and product sales in and beyond 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by approximately  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the acquisitions of zn  tdt and ia contributed additional research and development expense of approximately million in this increase in expense from the prior year was offset by billable labor hours of approximately  headcount reductions resulting in approximately  in cost savings  capitalized software development costs of approximately  and a reduction in research and development activity from our services organization of approximately million 
in addition to the revenue generating funded research provided by our research and development organization  we also had operating expense offsets from reimbursed research and development costs in germany of approximately  we expect to continue to generate billings and expense reimbursements related to our funded research and development activity in as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  we expect research and development expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue in as we continue to support our product development strategy 
we believe that our products organization  through its focus on the success of our customers  will continue to generate a robust pipeline of product offerings that will ultimately drive our development plan 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the acquisitions contributed approximately million of additional general and operating expenses from the prior year 
in  legal costs increased by approximately million primarily related to the litigation involving our contract with the state of georgia 
compliance costs for consultants and auditors related to our sarbanes oxley compliance requirements in contributed an additional  of general and administrative expense 
other expense increases in related to an increase in corporate strategy consulting costs of  move related costs and accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements for abandoned property of  an increase in expenses for investor relations  insurance and listing fees due to company growth of  and severance and other personnel costs of  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  in  we do not anticipate any costs related to moving our corporate headquarters  but we do expect that other general and administrative expenses related to insurance  investor relations and listing fees may increase as we continue to grow 
in addition  we expect to add resources to our financing and accounting organization in that will increase our general and administrative expenses 
we expect these additional costs may be offset by a decrease in consulting expenses 
impairment of long lived asset in december  the superior court for fulton county  georgia granted summary judgment in favor of georgia s department of motor vehicle safety  or dmvs  in connection with litigation brought by digimarc id systems  llc in march alleging that dmvs did not comply with its own bid process when it selected viisage as the vendor for its new digital drivers license program 
in july  the court had issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting dmvs from continuing to work with us to install the state s new drivers license system 
in july  we reached a settlement agreement with the state pursuant to which dmvs terminated the contract for convenience and agreed to pay us million in cash and the state agreed to purchase certain equipment from us for  in its december ruling  the georgia court authorized dmvs to issue a new request for proposals for a digital drivers license system  but disallowed the million cash payment described above 
due to the uncertainty of the cash settlement as a result of the judge s ruling and the uncertainty of future cash flows from this contract to support the book value of certain system assets installed  we have identified million of assets deployed within the state that we have deemed to have no alternative use 
we reduced the recorded value of these assets from approximately million to their estimated fair value of approximately  based on our estimate of realizable value from liquidation of these assets  which resulted in a million charge in the fourth quarter of we also have evaluated for impairment the remaining million in assets being retained by us from the georgia contract 
these consist of approximately million of assets that we anticipate using in georgia if we win the contract based on the new request for proposals  approximately  of assets that we anticipate could either be used in georgia under a new contract or used in other projects  and approximately million of assets constituting our central production facility in georgia 
based upon our current probability weighted estimate of cash flows  we have determined that these assets are not currently impaired 
while we believe we can utilize these assets either in georgia  if we win the new contract  or on alternative projects  to the extent that we are unable to utilize these assets or realize value through a sale of these assets or reach a new settlement with dmvs regarding these assets  we would be required to take a further charge to earnings 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  increased approximately  from  for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to  of interest on the million note used to purchase tdt 

table of contents other income expense  net other expense of approximately  for the year ended december  was primarily the result of realized and unrealized losses related to foreign currency fluctuations on purchases that we made in japanese yen in for the year ended december  we had  of other income related to gains on disposal of assets in that year 
we plan to implement strategies to minimize losses from foreign currency transactions in income taxes for the year ended december   we had a provision for federal income taxes of approximately  which resulted from our election to treat the acquisition of tdt as an asset transaction for tax purposes 
this election created a deferred tax liability for tax deductible amortization of certain goodwill and a related non cash tax expense 
there was no provision for federal income taxes for the year ended december  the provision for state income taxes for the year ended december  was approximately  compared to  for the year ended december  other comprehensive loss other comprehensive loss results primarily from translation adjustments with our german operations 
net revenue and related expenses generated from our international location in germany are denominated in euros 
the results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances associated with this international location are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
as of december   we had cumulative translation adjustments related to our germany operations of approximately  to the extent the us dollar weakens against these foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currencies denominated transactions results in increased net revenue  operating expenses and net income 
similarly  our net revenue  operating expenses and net income will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and revenue revenue for the year ended december  increased to million from million in after adjusting the results on a pro forma basis for the impact of the accounting change 
the increase was the result of credential volume increases in five states generating additional revenue in those states of approximately million 
volume increases in two states resulted from the addition of new types of credentials or from normal fluctuations in credential issuances 
volume increases under our contracts with the connecticut department of motor vehicles and the state of rhode island  division of motor vehicles were due to a full year of card production in  in addition we began card production in oklahoma in in addition to the volume increases  revenue under our contract serving the maryland department of transportation and motor vehicle administration increased million in due to a full year of delivery on that contract 
we also experienced an increase in revenue of approximately  due to net price per credential increases on contract extensions signed in these increases  were offset by volume decreases under drivers license contracts in two states  which resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately  these increases  in revenue for were also offset by decreases in revenue of approximately  under our contracts with arizona department of transportation and new mexico department of taxation and revenue as a result of the expiration of those contracts in other increases related to the inclusion of a full year of revenue derived from our pinellas county contract signed in october we also delivered face recognition solutions to the united arab emirates for the dubai international airport and to alberta  canada in mid  which contributed approximately  of additional revenue combined 
gross margin gross margins increased to for the year ended december  compared to for after adjusting the results on a pro forma basis for the impact of accounting changes 
we expect gross margins 
table of contents on our drivers license contracts to fluctuate based on changes in period cost of sales as a result of our adoption of eitf due to the fact that in and in the future we will effectively recognize revenue on a fixed price per credential produced by our customers 
if we successfully achieve cost saving measures in the delivery process  we will realize higher gross margins in those periods where the cost savings measures are achieved 
alternatively  in periods where our delivery costs are higher due to service and maintenance requirements  we expect gross margins to decrease for those periods 
we achieved margin increases on of our active drivers license contracts in those contracts represented approximately of the total revenue in that segment for the year 
the margin increases were attributable to our commitment to minimize period costs during the card production phase on all of our drivers license contracts 
we were able to achieve some of these costs savings by minimizing overtime labor charges through better resource management of field service technicians 
in addition  we installed inventory management software in multiple states in  which allows us to better control consumables scrap thus reducing our materials costs 
in addition to these cost savings initiatives  we signed contract extensions in five states and began card production in two additional states during  both of which resulted in margin increases for those states 
these increases were offset by gross margin decreases in other states due primarily to decreases in credential volume during the year 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million in as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses decreased to in from in after adjusting the results on a pro forma basis for the impact of accounting changes 
the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the number of drivers license contracts coming up for bid in within the secure credentials segment as a result of delays within certain states due to budgetary constraints 
the bid and proposal process related to the secure credentials contracts for state drivers license contracts generally requires the involvement of our technology personnel as we devise the system architecture during this phase that satisfies the states requirements in the proposal 
as proposal volume was down in  there was increased focus of these resources in other areas  specifically on the delivery of the systems that were contracted in research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million in as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses decreased to from in after adjusting the results on a pro forma basis for the impact of accounting changes 
these decreases are the result of a restructuring and workforce reduction in the fourth quarter of  as well as a decrease in our internal investment in research and development during anticipating the contribution that the zn acquisition will bring to our research and development initiatives in the future 
development costs that benefited specific projects were recorded as cost of revenues and costs that did not benefit specific projects were recorded as research and development expenses 
software development costs we have capitalized subsequent to achieving technological feasibility have not been material 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat  increasing by approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million in as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in after adjusting results on a pro forma basis for the impact of accounting changes 
the slight increase in general and administrative expenses was due to the logistical support required to grow our business through acquisitions while continuing to meet the financing requirements created by our expanding operations 
the benefits that we experienced related to the restructuring in and other cost savings initiatives were offset by additional expenses related to new strategic 
table of contents actions taken in additional general and administrative expenses related to these actions included  of expense related to new strategic hires   of expenses related to additional employee terminations in   of expenses related to pursuing new financing opportunities and  of additional professional fees related to our contract in georgia 
interest expense interest expense  net of approximately  and  of interest income in and  respectively  increased approximately  for the year ended december  to  from  in the increase in interest expense reflects the additional debt financing required to support contract delivery in other income for the year ended december  we had other income of  related to a gain on the sale of certain card printer assets 
there was no other income recognized for the year ended december  income taxes no provision for federal income taxes has been made for the years ended december  and due to the net loss in both periods 
for the year ended december   the provision for state income taxes was approximately  there was no provision for state income taxes for the year ended december  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the year ended december   we incurred a non cash charge of million representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to our adoption of eitf on a cumulative basis as of january  liquidity and capital resources cash was approximately million at december  as of december   there were no restrictions on our cash 
for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  which stems from our net loss of approximately million  offset by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of approximately million  non cash impairment charges of million  and offset by cash used by the net change in operating assets and liabilities of approximately million 
accounts receivable increased approximately from approximately million at december  to approximately million at december  approximately million of this increase was the result of accounts receivable balances acquired in the remaining difference related to approximately million account receivable from telos corporation related to the us department of defense cac procurement  december billings on document authentication products and acquired contracts of approximately million  and a receivable from one state drivers license customer for million 
of the outstanding accounts receivable balance as of december   approximately million was aged less than days 
inventories and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings decreased from million at december  to approximately million at december  as of december   this balance generally consists of consumables inventory supporting our drivers license contracts 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by approximately from million at december  to million at december  approximately million of this increase was the result of 
table of contents assumed liabilities from the acquisitions of zn  tdt and ia  and approximately million related to the us department of defense cac procurement 
the remaining difference related to timing of payments and additional accruals required as of december   primarily related to our compliance efforts and increased employee obligations resulting from our growth from the prior year 
during  we repaid in full our million debt obligation to lau technologies  or lau  one of our principal stockholders 
during  we also repaid in full a million promissory note that we had issued to buddy beck  a director of viisage and the former sole shareholder of tdt in connection with our acquisition of tdt 
million of the note was repaid in cash and the remaining million was settled as an offset against a purchase price reduction negotiated as part of the acquisition of tdt 
in addition  we repaid million representing the outstanding principal balance under our loan agreement with commerce bank and trust company which was subsequently terminated 
on december   we entered into a loan and security agreement with citizens bank of massachusetts 
the loan and security agreement permits us to borrow up to  subject to certain financial covenants which may restrict the amounts borrowed 
as of december   we estimate that the amount available to us under the loan and security agreement was approximately million based on the financial covenants 
any amounts borrowed under the loan and security agreement bear interest at the rate of citizens prime rate minus or the london interbank offered rate libor plus  at our option  and must be repaid on or before may  in march  we entered into an amendment to the loan and security agreement to modify the financial covenants and make certain other changes 
currently  there are no borrowings outstanding under the loan and security agreement other than a commitment of million in letters of credit issued by citizens to certain of our customers 
in accordance with the loan and security agreement  borrowings are secured by the inventory  receivables  equipment and other business assets excluding intellectual property of viisage and our subsidiaries

we have received a waiver from citizens bank for the quarter ended december   
table of contents and  as noted above  have amended this covenant and certain of the other covenants in the loan and security agreement 
although we are in compliance with the amended financial covenants for the quarter ended april   we are not in compliance with the covenant that requires us to make timely required filings with the securities and exchange commission as a result of our failure to timely file this form k and our form q for the quarter ended april  once we have made these filings  we will be in compliance with all of the covenants under the loan and security agreement 
while there currently are no borrowings outstanding under the loan and security agreement other than a commitment of million in letters of credit issued by citizens to certain of our customers  if we do not remain in compliance with the applicable covenants  citizens could refuse to lend funds to us and could require immediate repayment of any amounts outstanding at the time that we are not in compliance with such covenants 
in april we entered into arrangements for an aggregate of approximately million of equipment financing with three of our suppliers 
these project lease arrangements are accounted for as capital leases 
there are no financial covenants associated with these leasing arrangements 
as of december   we had outstanding approximately  under these arrangements 
the interest rates on these capital leases are between and and are fixed 
the terms of these leases range from months to months 
in august  we entered into an arrangement for financing of database licenses with another vendor 
as of december   we had outstanding approximately  under this arrangement 
in the first quarter of we purchased an asset for  which amount is payable in installments over four years 
on the december  balance sheet   is included in accounts payable and other accrued expenses and  is recorded under other liabilities representing the discounted future payments remaining under this installment payment agreement 
in january  we sold  shares of our common stock at per share in a private sale to certain institutional investors to which we had previously sold shares in a private sale in september on february   we funded the acquisition of tdt with million of available cash and executed a promissory note for an additional million in addition to the issuance of new stock 
the note bore interest at a rate of per year and was payable in equal installments of principal and interest on december   may  and december  this debt was offset by approximately  of identified purchase price adjustments related to certain provisions in the stock purchase agreement 
as of december   all principal and interest on this note was paid in full 
an additional purchase price adjustment of million  payable to the former sole shareholder of tdt  was incurred based upon tdt s selection by the us department of defense for the production of smart cards as part of the agency s common access card cac program 
as of december   this related party payable was paid in full 
in august  we sold  shares of our common stock at per share in an underwritten public offering 
net proceeds from these sales were approximately million 
on october   we funded the acquisition of ia with approximately million of available cash and assumed indebtedness of ia in the amount of approximately million  all of which indebtedness was repaid in full from available cash concurrently with the closing of the merger 
we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and debt service requirements for the next months 
in addition  as of december   and as of june   we estimate that the amount available to us under our loan and security agreement with citizens bank was approximately million based on the financial covenants 
however  if we cannot achieve our operating goals in or if we win additional secure credentials contracts in  we may be required to seek additional financing  either in the form of debt or equity 
we also may seek additional financing to fund acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
due to our failure to timely file this form k and our form q for the fiscal quarter ended 
table of contents april   we are subject to a delisting proceeding by the nasdaq stock market 
if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market  this may have an adverse effect on our ability to raise funds in the capital markets or may adversely affect the price and terms at which we are able to raise such funds 
our ability to meet our business forecast is dependent on a number of factors  including those described in the section of this report entitled factors that may affect future results 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december   in thousands 
total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations includes approximately  of interest

sfas is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
and do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
factors that may affect future results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties  including those not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business 
we have a history of operating losses 
we have a history of operating losses 
our business operations began in and  except for fiscal years and  have resulted in net losses in each fiscal year  including a net loss of million in at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we will continue to invest in the development of our secure credential and biometric technologies 
accordingly  we cannot predict when or if we will ever achieve profitability on an annual basis 
we may be unable to obtain additional capital required to fund our operations and finance our growth 
the installation of our secure credentials systems requires significant capital expenditures 
while we have been successful in the past in obtaining financing for working capital and capital expenditures  we will have ongoing capital needs as we expand our business 
we may be unable to obtain additional funds in a timely manner or on acceptable terms  which would render us unable to fund our operations or expand our business 
if we are unable to obtain capital when needed  we may have to restructure our business or delay or abandon our development and expansion plans 
we derive over of our revenue from government contracts  which are often non standard  involve competitive bidding  may be subject to cancellation with or without penalty and may produce volatility in earnings and revenue 
more than of our business involves providing products and services under contracts with us federal  state  local and foreign government agencies 
obtaining contracts from government agencies is challenging  and government contracts often include provisions that are not standard in private commercial transactions 
for example  government contracts may include provisions that allow the government agency to terminate the contract without penalty under some circumstances  be subject to purchasing decisions of agencies that are subject to political influence  
table of contents contain onerous procurement procedures  and be subject to cancellation if government funding becomes unavailable 
foreign government contracts generally include comparable provisions relating to termination for the convenience of the relevant foreign government 
securing government contracts can be a protracted process involving competitive bidding 
in many cases  unsuccessful bidders may challenge contract awards  which can lead to increased costs  delays and possible loss of the contract for the winning bidder 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few customers  the loss of which could have an adverse effect on our revenues 
for the year ended december   two customers  telos corporation us department of defense and us department of state each accounted for over of our revenue and an aggregate of of our revenue 
for the year ended december   two customers  pennsylvania department of transportation and illinois secretary of state  each accounted for over of our revenues and an aggregate of of our revenue 
for  two customers  connecticut department of information technology and mississippi department of information technology services  each accounted for over of our revenues and an aggregate of of our revenue 
since a small number of customers in our secure credentials segment account for a substantial portion of our revenues  the loss of any of our significant customers would cause revenue to decline and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we derive revenue from only a limited number of products and services and we do not have a diversified product or service base 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from the sale of products and services comprising our identity solutions 
we anticipate that substantially all of the growth in our revenue  if any  will also be derived from these sources 
if for any reason our sale of these products or services is impeded  and we have not diversified our product and service offerings  our business and results from operations could be harmed 
we could face adverse consequences as a result of our late sec filings 
we failed to timely file this form k and our form q for the fiscal quarter ended april  as a result  we will not be eligible to use a short form registration statement on form s for a period of months after becoming current in our filings 
our inability to use a short form registration statement for a period of months after becoming current in our sec reporting obligations may impair our ability or increase the costs and complexity of our efforts  to raise funds in the public markets or use our stock as consideration in acquisitions should we desire to do so during this one year period 
in addition  if we are unable to remain current in our future filings  we may face additional adverse consequences  including an inability to have a registration statement under the securities act of covering a public offering of securities declared effective by the sec  an inability to make offerings pursuant to existing registration statements including registration statements on form s covering employee stock plans or pursuant to certain private placement rules of the sec under regulation d to any purchasers not qualifying as accredited investors  the possible delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq national market  and limitations on the ability of our affiliates to sell our securities pursuant to rule under the securities act 
these restrictions may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees and may further impair our ability to raise funds in the public markets should we desire to do so or use our stock as consideration in acquisitions 
in addition  our future success depends largely upon the support of our customers  suppliers and investors 
the late sec filings have resulted in negative publicity and a nasdaq delisting proceeding  and may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock 
the effects of the late sec filings could cause some of our customers or potential customers to refrain from purchasing or defer decisions to purchase our products and services 
additionally  current or potential suppliers may re examine their willingness to do business with us  
table of contents to develop critical interfaces to our products or to supply products and services if they lose confidence in our ability to fulfill our commitments 
any of these losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial and business prospects 
our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market  which may  among other things  reduce the price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders 
in april  we were advised by nasdaq that our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market because we were no longer in compliance with nasdaq s continued listing requirements as a result of our failure to timely file this form k 
we received a similar notice in may with respect to our failure to timely file our form q for the fiscal quarter ended april  a nasdaq listing qualifications panel has determined to continue the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market provided that we file this form k and our first quarter form q on or before june   and have evidenced compliance with all other requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq national market 
if we fail to timely file such reports  our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq national market  in which event our common stock would be listed on some other quotation medium  such as the pink sheets  depending upon our ability to meet the specific listing requirements of those quotation systems 
in the event our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market  the visibility  liquidity and price of our common stock may be reduced  and our stockholders may find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain accurate price quotations for  our shares 
in addition  if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market  it may also result in other negative implications  including the inability to raise funds in the capital markets  the potential loss of confidence by suppliers  customers and employees  the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities 
we have been named as a defendant in eight putative class action lawsuits  an adverse outcome in which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations by adversely affecting our cash position 
as described above in item  legal proceedings  in march and april  eight putative class action lawsuits were filed against us in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts 
the suits allege violations of the federal securities laws by us and certain of our officers and directors arising out of purported misrepresentations in the guidance that we provided on our anticipated financial results for fiscal following the release of our second and third quarter results  which allegedly artificially inflated the price of our stock during the period may  through march  we are not able to estimate the amount of the loss allegedly suffered by members of the putative class or the amount of legal costs and internal efforts associated with defending ourselves and our officers and directors 
if we are unsuccessful in defending ourselves in this litigation  these lawsuits could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows as a result of the damages that we would be required to pay 
it is possible that our insurance policies either may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
while we believe that the allegations and claims made in these lawsuits are wholly without merit and intend to defend the actions vigorously  we cannot be certain that we will be successful in this litigation 
we have taken an impairment charge to assets of million due to the georgia litigation  if we are unable to use the remaining assets from that contract  we may be required to take further impairment charges which could negatively affect our earnings 
in december  the superior court for fulton county  georgia granted summary judgment in favor of georgia s department of motor vehicle safety  or dmvs  in connection with litigation brought by digimarc id systems  llc in march alleging that dmvs did not comply with its own bid process when it selected viisage as the vendor for its new digital drivers license program 
in july  the court had issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting dmvs from continuing to work with us to install the state s new drivers license system 
in july  we reached a settlement agreement with the state pursuant to which dmvs terminated the contract for convenience and agreed to pay us million in cash and the state agreed to 
table of contents purchase certain equipment from us for  in its december ruling  the georgia court authorized dmvs to issue a new request for proposals for a digital drivers license system  but disallowed the million cash payment described above 
without this payment  we believe that either the settlement agreement with dmvs is not effective and that our contract with dmvs remains in place  or that our initial claim for an million settlement payment is revived 
the state has paid us the  for the equipment and we appealed the disallowance of the million settlement payment 
in may  the georgia supreme court voted not to hear our appeal of the summary judgment ruling on procedural grounds 
due to the uncertainty of the cash settlement as a result of the judge s ruling and the uncertainty of future cash flows from this contract to support the book value of certain system assets installed  we have identified million of assets deployed within the state that we have deemed to have no alternative use 
we reduced the recorded value of these assets from approximately million to their estimated fair value of approximately  based on our estimate of realizable value from liquidation of these assets  which resulted in a million charge in the fourth quarter of in addition  we have removed the contract from our backlog  and we will lose up to million in revenue that we expected to recognize over the next five and one half years  unless the contract remains in place or we are able to win the new contract for the digital drivers license system and the revenues from such new contract are substantially similar to the prior contract 
we also have evaluated for impairment the remaining million in assets being retained by us from the georgia contract 
these consist of approximately million of assets that we anticipate using in georgia if we win the contract based on the new request for proposals  approximately  of assets that we anticipate could either be used in georgia under a new contract or used in other projects  and approximately million of assets constituting our central production facility in georgia 
based upon our current probability weighted estimate of cash flows  we have determined that these assets are not currently impaired 
while we believe we can utilize these assets either in georgia  if we win the new contract  or on alternative projects  to the extent that we are unable to utilize these assets or realize value through a sale of these assets or reach a new settlement with dmvs regarding these assets  we would be required to take a further charge to earnings 
if we are unable to successfully address the material weaknesses in our internal controls  our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected 
as a result  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and stock price 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  beginning with this annual report on form k  we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting 
such report must contain  among other matters  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
such report must also contain a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on management s assessment of such internal controls 
management s report and our auditors attestation report are included in this report on form k under item our external auditors notified management and the audit committee of our board of directors that they believed there were material weaknesses due to insufficient personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function to effect a timely financial close process and to evaluate and resolve non routine or complex accounting transactions and in the control processes around information technology systems 
these material weaknesses could result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected 
management has determined that it is in agreement with the auditors initial assessment that these control deficiencies constituted a material weakness as of december  because of these material weaknesses  management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december  our management has identified the steps necessary to address the material weaknesses described above  and has begun to execute remediation plans  as discussed in item of this report on form k  management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

table of contents any failure to implement in a timely manner and maintain the improvements in the controls over our financial reporting that we are currently putting in place  or difficulties encountered in the implementation of these improvements in our controls  could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations  to fail to produce reliable financial reports or to prevent fraud 
any failure to improve our internal controls to address these identified weaknesses could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative impact on our business  operating results and stock price 
we are investing significant time and resources to implement the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which may increase our operating expenses and reduce our profitability in the near future 
changes in the laws and regulations that have recently been enacted  including regulations under the sarbanes oxley act of  are likely to continue to increase our expenses as we devote resources in response to them 
for example  we already have deployed significant resources to document  implement and test our financial processes as part of our implementation of the requirements under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and we expect to incur additional time and expenses in connection with the requirements under section for our management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal control over financial reporting 
moreover  compliance with these rules could also cause us to further modify our existing review processes or divert our management s time and attention away from otherwise running our business  either of which could result in our company experiencing additional costs and expenses without corresponding increases in revenue 
consequently  as we take steps to further improve and strengthen our financial management and controls  we anticipate corresponding increases in our operating expenses that may reduce our profitability in the near future 
our strategy of expanding our face recognition business could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition 
part of our strategy is to enhance our leadership in face recognition technology 
pursuing this strategy involves risks 
for instance  to date  face recognition security solutions have not gained widespread commercial acceptance 
some of the obstacles to widespread acceptance of face recognition security solutions include a perceived loss of privacy and public perceptions as to the usefulness of face recognition technologies 
whether the market for face recognition security solutions will expand will be dependent upon factors such as the success of our marketing efforts and publicity campaigns and those of our competitors  and customer satisfaction with our products and services  as well as those of our competitors 
we do not know when  if ever  face recognition security solutions will gain widespread commercial acceptance 
in addition  our face recognition business segment has not achieved profitability  and it may never achieve profitability 
we face intense competition  which could result in lower revenues and higher research and development expenditures and could adversely affect our results of operations 
the events of september  and subsequent regulatory and policy changes in the us and abroad have heightened interest in the use of biometric security solutions  and we expect competition in this field  which is already substantial  to intensify 
competitors are developing and bringing to market biometric security solutions that use face recognition as well as eye  fingerprint and other forms of biometric verification 
our products also will compete with non biometric technologies such as certificate authorities and traditional keys  cards  surveillance systems and passwords 
widespread adoption of one or more of these technologies or approaches in the markets we intend to target could significantly reduce the potential market for our systems and products 
many of our competitors have significantly more cash and resources than we have 
our competitors may introduce products that are competitively priced  have increased performance or functionality or incorporate 
table of contents technological advances that we have not yet developed or implemented 
to remain competitive  we must continue to develop  market and sell new and enhanced systems and products at competitive prices  which will require significant research and development expenditures 
if we do not develop new and enhanced products or if we are not able to invest adequately in our research and development activities  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
unless we keep pace with changing technologies  we could lose customers and fail to win new customers 
our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce a variety of new products and services and enhancements to these new products and services in order to address the changing needs of the marketplace 
we may not be able to accurately predict which technologies customers will support 
if we do not introduce new products  services and enhancements in a timely manner  if we fail to choose correctly among technical alternatives or if we fail to offer innovative products and services at competitive prices  customers may forego purchases of our products and services and purchase those of our competitors 
security breaches in systems that we sell or maintain could result in the disclosure of sensitive government information or private personal information that could result in the loss of clients and negative publicity 
many of the systems we sell manage private personal information and protect information involved in sensitive government functions 
the protective measures that we use in these systems may not prevent security breaches  and failure to prevent security breaches may disrupt our business  damage our reputation  and expose us to litigation and liability 
a party who is able to circumvent security measures used in these systems could misappropriate sensitive or proprietary information or materials or cause interruptions or otherwise damage our products  services and reputation  and the property of our customers 
if unintended parties obtain sensitive data and information  or create bugs or viruses or otherwise sabotage the functionality of our systems  we may receive negative publicity  incur liability to our customers or lose the confidence of our customers  any of which may cause the termination or modification of our contracts 
further  our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover losses and liabilities that may result from such events 
in addition  we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect ourselves against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 
however  protective or remedial measures may not be available at a reasonable price or at all  or may not be entirely effective if commenced 
loss of limited source suppliers may result in delays or additional expenses 
we obtain certain hardware components and complete products from a limited group of suppliers 
our reliance on these suppliers involves significant risks  including reduced control over quality and delivery schedules 
in particular  we obtain all of the printers and consumables for the us department of state passport contract and the department of defense common access card contract from toppan printing co 
ltd 
moreover  any financial instability of our manufacturers or contractors could result in our having to find new suppliers 
we may experience significant delays in manufacturing and shipping our products to customers if we lose these sources or if supplies from these sources are delayed 
as a result  we may be required to incur additional development  manufacturing and other costs to establish alternative sources of supply 
it may take several months to locate alternative suppliers  if required  or to re tool our products to accommodate components from different suppliers 
we cannot predict if we will be able to obtain replacement components within the time frames we require at an affordable cost  or at all 
any delays resulting from suppliers failing to deliver components or products on a timely basis  in sufficient quantities and of sufficient quality or any significant increase in the price of components from existing or alternative suppliers could have a severe negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the market for our solutions is still developing and if the industry adopts standards or a platform different from our platform  then our competitive position would be negatively affected 
the market for identity solutions is still emerging 
the evolution of this market is in a constant state of flux that may result in the development of different technologies and industry standards that are not compatible with our current products or technologies 
in particular  the face recognition market lacks industry wide standards 
several organizations  such as the international civil aviation organization  which sets standards for travel documents that its member states then put into effect  and the national institute for standards and testing  which is part of the us department of commerce  have recently selected face recognition as the biometric to be used in identification documentation 
it is possible  however  that these standards may change and that any standards eventually adopted could prove disadvantageous to or incompatible with our business model and product lines 
legal claims regarding infringement by us or our suppliers of third party intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs  diversion of managerial resources and harm to our reputation 
although we believe that our products and services do not infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we might not be able to defend successfully against a third party infringement claim 
a successful infringement claim against us or our suppliers could subject us to liability for damages and litigation costs  including attorneys fees  lawsuits that prevent us from further use of the intellectual property  having to license the intellectual property from a third party  which could include significant licensing fees  having to develop a non infringing alternative  which could be costly and delay projects  having to indemnify clients with respect to losses they incurred as a result of the alleged infringement  and having to establish alternative sources for products supplied to us by third parties  as discussed above in the risk factor regarding our dependence on limited source suppliers 
even if we are not found liable in a claim for intellectual property infringement  such a claim could result in substantial costs  diversion of resources and management attention  termination of customer contracts and harm to our reputation 
see item  legal proceedings  above for a description of the settlement of a patent infringement action that had been filed against one of our subsidiaries 
uncertainties in global economic markets could cause delays in customer purchases 
many customers and potential customers have delayed purchase intentions as a result of uncertainties in global economic markets 
government budgets  particularly at state and regional levels  have been or are expected to be reduced notably 
government contracts result from purchasing decisions made by public sector agencies that are particularly sensitive to budget changes and cutbacks during economic downturns  and variations in appropriations cycles 
many us state customers are facing budget cuts  and some international customers are facing debt crises  introducing added uncertainty 
any shift in the government procurement process  which is outside of our control and may not be predictable  could impact the predictability of our quarterly results and may potentially have a material negative effect on our financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
if we do not successfully expand our direct sales and services organizations and partnering arrangements  we may not be able to increase our sales or support our customers 
in the fiscal years ended december  and  we sold substantially all of our services and licensed substantially all of our products through our direct sales organization 
our future success depends on 
table of contents substantially increasing the size and scope of our direct sales force and partnering arrangements  both domestically and internationally 
we will face intense competition for personnel  and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract  assimilate or retain additional qualified sales personnel on a timely basis 
moreover  given the large scale deployment required by some of our customers  we will need to hire and retain a number of highly trained customer service and support personnel 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase the size of our customer service and support organization on a timely basis to provide the high quality of support required by our customers 
failure to add additional sales and customer service representatives could result in our inability to increase our sales and support our customers 
integration of acquired businesses may be difficult and will consume significant financial and managerial resources  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
on january   we completed the acquisition of zn vision technologies ag  or zn  a leading german provider of face recognition and computer vision products and services 
on february   we completed the acquisition of tdt 
on october   we completed the acquisition of imaging automation  inc  a market leader in identity document authentication 
the integration of the products and services of these acquired companies with ours will be challenging and will consume significant financial and managerial resources 
the challenges involved with this integration include  among others challenges related to technology innovation  possible difficulty implementing uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and possible loss of key employees 
in addition  the differences between us and german business cultures and the geographic distance between the companies could present significant obstacles to our timely  cost effective integration of zn 
the significant direct and indirect costs of our acquisition and integration of zn  tdt and imaging automation could adversely affect our financial performance 
to date  we have incurred approximately million of costs in connection with the acquisitions of zn  tdt and imaging automation  including costs associated with integrating personnel  products and services  financial advisory fees  and costs and expenses for services provided by our lawyers and accountants 
the transaction costs and expenses attributable to financial advisory  legal and accounting services that we incurred will be capitalized as a component of the purchase price 
goodwill associated with the acquisition will be required to be tested at least annually for impairment  and we will be required to record a charge to earnings if there is an impairment in the value of such goodwill at a later date 
other intangible assets acquired in connection with these acquisitions will be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the acquisitions of zn  tdt and imaging automation could result in future impairment charges which could adversely affect our results of operations 
as a result of our acquisitions of zn  tdt and imaging automation  goodwill and other intangible assets have been created 
the values we may record for goodwill and other intangible assets will represent fair values calculated by independent third party appraisers 
such valuations require us to provide significant estimates and assumptions  which are derived from information obtained from the management of the acquired businesses and our business plans for the acquired businesses or intellectual property 
if estimates and assumptions used to initially value goodwill and intangible assets prove to be inaccurate  ongoing reviews of the carrying values of 
table of contents such goodwill and intangible assets may indicate impairments which will require us to record an impairment charge in the period in which we identify the impairments 
if we do not achieve the expected benefits of our acquisitions of zn  tdt and imaging automation  the price of our common stock could decline 
we expect that the acquisition of zn will enhance our leadership in face recognition technology through the combination of our technologies with those of zn 
although the results of the initial tests of our combined technologies have been positive  the combination of such technologies might not meet the demands of the marketplace 
if our technologies fail to meet such demand  customer acceptance of our face recognition solutions could decline  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we expect that the acquisition of zn will enable us to market our systems and products on a global scale 
our face recognition customers are primarily located in the united states  and zn s customers are primarily located in europe 
we might not be able to market successfully our products and services to zn s customers or zn s products and services to our customers 
we expect that the acquisition of tdt will enhance our position in the market for secure credentials  particularly the us government 
we expect that the acquisition of imaging automation will provide us with a market leadership position in identity document authentication and will complement our core competencies in secure credentials and biometrics 
we expect that this addition to our product portfolio will extend our reach into our current markets and provide a critical component to our comprehensive offering for new markets in need of identity solutions 
however  there can be no assurance that our current customers or customers in new markets will be receptive to these additional offerings 
if our product offerings and services fail to meet the demands of this marketplace  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
there is also a risk that we will not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions as rapidly as  or to the extent  anticipated by financial or industry analysts  or that such analysts will not perceive the same benefits to the acquisitions as we do 
if these risks materialize  our stock price could be adversely affected 
the success of our strategic plan to grow sales and develop relationships in europe may be limited by risks related to conducting business in european markets 
although zn has experience marketing and distributing its products and developing strategic relationships in europe  part of our strategy will be to increase sales and build additional relationships in european markets 
risks inherent in marketing  selling and developing relationships in european markets include those associated with  economic conditions in european markets  including fluctuations in the relative values of the us dollar and the euro  taxes and fees imposed by european governments that may increase the cost of products and services  and laws and regulations imposed by individual countries and by the european union 
in addition  european intellectual property laws are different than us intellectual property laws and we will have to ensure that our intellectual property is adequately protected in foreign jurisdictions and that zn s intellectual property is adequately protected in the united states 
if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights  competitors could use our proprietary technologies in non protected jurisdictions and put us at a competitive disadvantage 
our business may be impacted by changes in the local marketplace of our foreign operations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
as a result of our acquisitions of zn  tdt and imaging automation  we expect that we will have increased exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
net revenue and related expenses generated from our international location in germany are denominated in euros 
the results of operations and certain of our inter company balances associated with this international location are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
as of 
table of contents december   the cumulative loss from foreign currency translation adjustments was  in addition to our german operation  we will have increased transactions with japanese vendors supplying hardware and consumables for the delivery of the tdt contracts 
these transactions will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations with the yen 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against these foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currencies denominated transactions results in increased net revenue  operating expenses and net income 
similarly  our net revenue  operating expenses and net income will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies 
for the year ended december   we had realized and unrealized losses related to transactions with japanese vendors of approximately  if our systems and products do not perform as promised  we could experience increased costs  lower margins  liquidated damage payment obligations and harm to our reputation 
we will be required to provide complex systems that will be required to operate on an as needed basis 
although we will deploy back up systems  the failure of our products to perform as promised could result in increased costs  lower margins  liquidated damage payment obligations and harm to our reputation 
this could result in contract terminations and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our reputation  affect our competitive position and cost us money 
we believe that our intellectual property  including our methodologies  will be critical to our success and competitive position 
if we are unable to protect this intellectual property against unauthorized use by third parties  our reputation among existing and potential customers could be damaged and our competitive position adversely affected 
our strategies to deter misappropriation could be undermined if the proprietary nature or protection of our methodologies is not recognized in the united states or foreign countries  third parties misappropriate our proprietary methodologies and such misappropriation is not detected  and competitors create applications similar to ours but which do not technically infringe on our legally protected rights 
if these risks materialize  we could be required to spend significant amounts to defend our rights and divert critical managerial resources 
in addition  our proprietary methodologies may decline in value or our rights to them may become unenforceable 
if we fail to adequately manage our resources  it could have a severe negative impact on our financial results or stock price 
we could be subject to fluctuations in technology spending by existing and potential customers 
accordingly  we will have to actively manage expenses in a rapidly changing economic environment 
this could require reducing costs during economic downturns and selectively growing in periods of economic expansion 
if we do not properly manage our resources in response to these conditions  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
future acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to our business 
beyond the acquisitions of zn  tdt and imaging automation  our growth strategy could include additional acquisitions of companies or technologies that complement ours 
future acquisitions could involve risks inherent in acquisitions  such as challenges associated with integrating acquired technologies and the business and operations of acquired companies  exposure to unknown liabilities  
table of contents diversion of managerial resources from day to day operations  possible loss of key employees  customers and suppliers  higher than expected transaction costs  and additional dilution to our existing stockholders if we use our common stock as consideration 
if we fail to manage these challenges adequately  our results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to remain competitive 
we believe that the continued service of our executive officers will be important to our future growth and competitiveness 
we have entered into employment agreements with bernard c 
bailey  our chief executive officer  william k 
aulet  our chief financial officer  iftikhar ahmad  our senior vice president of global services  mohamed lazzouni  our chief technology officer  and james p 
ebzery  our senior vice president  customer solutions 
these agreements are intended to provide the executives with incentives to remain employed by us 
however  we cannot assure you that they will remain employed by us 
in addition  we believe that the continued employment of key members of our technical and sales staff is important to us 
most of our employees are entitled to voluntarily terminate their relationship with us  typically without any  or with only minimal  advance notice 
the process of finding additional trained personnel to carry out our strategy could be lengthy  costly and disruptive 
we might not be able to retain the services of all of our key employees or a sufficient number of them to execute our plans 
in addition  we might not be able to continue to attract new employees as required 
our quarterly results could be volatile and may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly operating results and we expect those fluctuations to continue 
we expect that our quarterly results will continue to be affected by  among other things  factors such as the size and timing of contract awards  the timing of our contract performance  variations in the mix of our products and services  and contract losses and changes in management estimates inherent in accounting for contracts 
certain of our stockholders have significant relationships with us  which could result in us taking actions that are not supported by unaffiliated stockholders 
lau technologies  or lau  and mr 
buddy beck  the former sole stockholder of tdt who is now a director and vice chairman of our board of directors  beneficially own approximately and  respectively  of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  both lau and mr 
beck have a strong influence on matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and most corporate actions  including mergers and acquisitions 
in addition  we have significant relationships with each of lau and mr 
beck  including we acquired significant intellectual property  contracts and distribution channels through a transaction with lau in january under which we agreed to pay lau a royalty on our face recognition revenues through june   up to a maximum of million  in connection with the above transaction with lau  we entered into consulting agreements with joanna lau  the president of lau  and her spouse denis k 
berube  the chief operating officer of lau who also serves as the chairman of our board of directors  under which we will pay each of ms 
lau and mr 
berube  per year for ten years  
table of contents the chairman of our board of directors and his spouse own a majority of lau s voting stock  in connection with the acquisition of tdt in february  mr 
beck was elected a member of our board of directors and appointed vice chairman  in connection with the acquisition of tdt  we entered into a consulting agreement with mr 
beck under which we will pay mr 
beck  per year for two years  provided that mr 
beck devotes his full business time to developing business opportunities for us  and an additional purchase price adjustment of million  payable to mr 
beck  was incurred upon tdt s selection by the us department of defense for the production of smart cards as part of the agency s cac program 
this amount has been paid in full 
future sales of our common stock by lau or mr 
buddy beck could depress the market price of our common stock 
as of june   there were  shares of our common stock outstanding 
lau and mr 
buddy beck own approximately and  respectively  of our common stock 
if either of these stockholders sell a significant number of shares of our common stock in the open market  our stock price could decline 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since our january acquisition of zn  our international operating results from transactions by our german operations have been denominated in euros 
for the year ended december   the cumulative loss from foreign currency translation adjustments was  hardware and consumables purchases related to contracts associated with the tdt acquisition are denominated in japanese yen 
we mitigate exchange rate volatility by purchasing local currencies at favorable exchange rates 
prior to  we did not hedge foreign currencies utilizing derivative instruments 
subsequent to year end  we entered into derivatives contracts to mitigate exchange risk associated with our japanese yen purchases 
for the year ended december   we had realized and unrealized losses related to transactions with japanese vendors of approximately  our international operations and transactions are subject to risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign currency exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors
