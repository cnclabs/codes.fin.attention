item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risks that may affect results in this section 
effective july   we report on a week year 
each period ends on a saturday and each year ends on the saturday closest to june fiscal year started on july  and ended on july  fiscal years and ended june  and  respectively  and were reported on a calendar month basis 
for the year ended july   comparable store sales were determined using a comparable period of days 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the time the products are received by the customers in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized for store sales at the point at which the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register with either cash or credit card 
for online sales  revenue is recognized at the time the customer receives the product 
we estimate and defer revenue and the related product costs for shipments that are in transit to the customer 
customers typically receive goods within a few days of shipment 
amounts related to shipping billed to customers are reflected in net sales and the related costs are reflected in cost of goods sold 
discounts offered to customers consist primarily of point of sale markdowns and are recorded at the time of the related sale as a reduction of revenue 
the value of points earned by our loyalty program members is included as a liability and a reduction of revenue at the time the points are earned 
gift certificates sold are carried as a liability and revenue is recognized when the gift certificate is redeemed 
similarly  customers may receive a store credit in exchange for returned goods 
store credits are carried as a liability until redeemed 
royalty revenue from product licensees is recorded as earned 
inventories 
our inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which is generally the merchandise selling price 
to ensure that our raw material is properly valued we age the fabric inventory and record a reserve in accordance with our established policy  which is based on historical experience 
to ensure our finished goods inventory is properly valued we review the age and turnover of our inventory and record a reserve if the selling price is marked down below cost 
these assumptions can have an impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
we estimate shrinkage for the period between the last physical count and balance sheet date based on historic shrinkage trends 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as store closures or poor performing stores  indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted cash flows from the long lived assets are less than the carrying value we record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s fair value 
in addition  at the time a decision is made to close a store  we record an impairment charge  if appropriate  or accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life of the asset 
historically  our impairment charges have been immaterial 
during fiscal  and  we recorded charges for the impairment of store assets of   and  respectively 
we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
sales return reserve 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns based on historical return trends 
as of july  and june   the reserve was  and  respectively 
if actual returns are greater than those projected  additional sales returns may be recorded in the future 
accrued litigation 
we accrue estimates of probable liabilities of lawsuits 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
as information becomes available  we assess the potential liabilities related to pending litigation and revise our estimates as necessary 
such revisions of estimates could materially impact the results of operations and financial position 
self insurance 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for employee related health care benefits 
we record self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of those claims incurred but not reported 
any projection of losses concerning our liability is subject to a high degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors such as future inflation rates  changes in severity  benefit level changes  medical costs and claim settlement patterns 
should a different amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or costs of the claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated  reserves may need to be adjusted in the future 
income taxes 
we accrue liabilities for estimates of probable settlements of domestic and foreign tax audits 
at any one time  many tax years may be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings 
we also record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets arising from foreign tax credit carryforwards as the utilization of these credits is not assured 
marketable securities the company s marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at cost which approximates their fair market value 
in prior years  the company had classified auction rate securities as cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets 
these securities have stated maturities beyond one year but are priced and traded as short term instruments due to the liquidity provided through the interest rate reset mechanism and are classified as short term when they represent investments of cash that are intended for use in current operations 
to conform to the current year presentation  the company has reclassified million of auction rate securities from cash equivalents to short term investments as of june  there was no impact on the consolidated statements of operations as a result of the reclassification 
the impact on the consolidated statements of cash flows was an increase of million and million in cash used in investing activities for the years ended june  and  respectively 
lease accounting the company leases retail stores and office space under operating leases 
during fiscal  in order to comply with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
accounting for leases  fasb technical bulletin no 
accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  and fasb technical bulletin no 
issues relating to accounting for leases  and consistent with the views expressed by the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission to the american institute of certified public accountants on february   the company corrected the manner in which it accounts for construction allowances and the period over which it recognizes rent expense 
historically  the company has recognized straight line expense for leases beginning on the store opening date which had the effect of excluding the build out period of its stores from the calculation of the period over which it expenses rent 
the company has corrected its lease accounting to begin recording rent expense when it takes possession of a store  which occurs approximately days prior to the opening of the store 
additionally  construction allowances related to store openings prior to september had been recorded as reductions of property and equipment and amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense 
construction allowances related to store openings prior to september have been appropriately reclassified as deferred rent and are amortized as a reduction of rent expense 
construction allowances related to store openings beginning in september were appropriately recorded as deferred rent and amortized as a reduction of rent expense 
the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustments resulted in an increase to total assets of million  an increase to deferred rent and other lease incentives of million  and a reduction to net income before income taxes of million 
the effect of the cumulative adjustment on net income after tax is million  or per diluted share 
the company recorded this adjustment as a cumulative  non cash charge in the third quarter ended april  prior year financial results have not been restated due to the immateriality of this issue to the results of operations and financial position for the current year or any individual prior year 
the adjustment will not affect historical or future cash flows or timing of payments under related leases 
furthermore  it is not expected to have any material impact on future earnings 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based compensation payments and supersedes the company s current accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas r is effective for all annual periods beginning after june  in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to the adoption of sfas r 
the company will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal under the modified prospective method 
the company currently recognizes the compensation expense of restricted stock awards and discloses the pro forma compensation expense of stock options over the vesting period 
under the modified prospective method of sfas no 
r  the company is required to recognize compensation expense for the outstanding portion of any awards for which compensation expense had not previously been recognized or disclosed under sfas no 
under sfas r the company will recognize compensation expense for restricted stock and stock option awards over the vesting period 
the pro forma information in note to the consolidated financial statements presents the estimated compensation charges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
as a result of the provisions of sfas r and sab  the company expects its compensation charges under sfas r to be similar to the pro forma information in note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  the company s assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the company s stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
in november  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material and requires that these items be recognized as current period charges 
sfas applies only to inventory costs incurred during periods beginning after the effective date and also requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to conversion costs be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective beginning in fiscal the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended july  june  june  statement of operating data net sales cost of sales  including production and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest and other income  net earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes net earnings cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise  occupancy costs and production costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs 
years ended july  and june  net sales 
net sales increased to million during the year ended july  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
of this increase  an increase in comparable store sales of contributed million  and stores not included in the comparable store sales base  on line sales  wholesale sales to international licensees  and royalty revenue from product licensees added million to sales 
the increase in comparable store sales performance was largely due to customer acceptance of the product offering 
based on the company s current sales trend  we expect positive comparable store sales in fiscal year gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for the year ended july  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to for fiscal from during fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales from the prior year of resulted from favorable occupancy leverage of percentage points as a result of higher comparable store sales and improved merchandise margins of percentage points primarily as a result of lower markdowns sold  offset by lease accounting adjustments of million  or percentage points  as discussed in lease accounting above 
if the current sales trend continues  we expect to experience margin improvement as a result of favorable occupancy leverage 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  which primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs  increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased to during fiscal from in fiscal this decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increased leverage on compensation and fixed expenses as a result of higher comparable store sales 
if the current sales trend continues  we expect to benefit from increased leverage on fixed expenses  offset by additional advertising expenditures  during fiscal interest and other income  net 
we generated million of interest and other income net of other expenses during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest and other income results from an increase of average cash and equivalent and marketable securities balances due to positive operating results 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the lower effective tax rate for is primarily attributable to an increase in tax exempt interest 
years ended june  and net sales 
net sales increased to million during the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
of this increase  an increase in comparable store sales of contributed million  and stores not included in the comparable store sales base  on line sales  wholesale sales to international licensees  and royalty revenue from product licensees added million to sales 
the increase in comparable store sales performance was largely due to customer acceptance of the product offering and a more balanced assortment of merchandise that contributed to an increase in transactions per store 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to for fiscal from during fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted from improved merchandise margins of percentage points and favorable occupancy leverage of percentage points 
these improvements are a result of customer acceptance of our merchandise and higher comparable store sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  which primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs  increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased to during fiscal from in fiscal this decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower compensation associated with higher store productivity  lower depreciation due to fully depreciated assets  offset by increased incentive compensation and costs associated with the potential settlements of outstanding lawsuits 
interest and other income  net 
we generated million of interest and other income net of other expenses during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest and other income results from the continued increase of average cash and equivalent and marketable securities balances due to positive operating results  offset by lower interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the higher effective tax rate for is primarily attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance against foreign tax credit carry forwards as the utilization of these carry forwards is not assured 
seasonality of business and quarterly results our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail and apparel industries 
as a result  our typical store generates a higher percentage of our annual net sales and profitability in the second quarter of our fiscal year which includes the holiday selling season compared to other quarters of our fiscal year 
if for any reason our sales were below seasonal norms during the second quarter of our fiscal year  our annual operating results would be negatively impacted 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital requirements vary widely throughout the year and generally peak in the first and second fiscal quarters 
at july   we had approximately million of cash and equivalents  short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities on hand 
in addition  we had a revolving line of credit  under which we could borrow or issue letters of credit up to a combined total of million  which expires in march as of july   there were no cash borrowings under the line of credit and letters of credit outstanding totaled million 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities for these periods was primarily generated by earnings adjusted for depreciation  deferred rent  and changes in working capital 
the increase of million for fiscal over fiscal is primarily due to an increase in net earnings of million  an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million  an increase in deferred rent of million excluding million related to lease accounting reclassifications  offset by an increase in deferred income taxes of million 
net cash used by investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the primary use of these funds was for the purchase of marketable securities and capital expenditures 
the increase in cash used by investing activities in was primarily a result of net purchases of marketable securities of million  as compared to net purchases of million and million in and  respectively 
capital expenditures of million in comprise million related to the opening of new stores  million related to the relocation and expansion of existing stores  million related to improvements of our new design studio and production facility in los angeles  million related to investments in management information systems  and million on other projects 
capital expenditures of million in comprise million for the purchase of our new design studio and production facility in los angeles  million related to the opening of new stores  million related to the relocation and expansion of existing stores  million related to investments in management information systems  and million on other projects 
we opened   and new stores in fiscal  and  respectively  and we expect to open stores in fiscal in fiscal year  we expect capital expenditures of approximately million which comprise approximately million for new stores  approximately million for relocation and expansion of existing stores  approximately million for investments in management information systems and approximately million of other capital expenditures 
during fiscal  the average bebe and bebe sport new store construction costs before tenant allowances were  the average gross inventory investment per store was  net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and was derived from proceeds from the issuance of common stock arising from stock option exercises  partially offset in fiscal by the payment of dividends of million 
we believe that our cash on hand  together with our cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements through fiscal our future capital requirements  however  will depend on numerous factors  including without limitation  the size and number of new and expanded stores  investment costs for management information systems  potential acquisitions and or joint ventures  repurchase of stock and future results of operations 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables summarize our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july  in thousands amount of commitment expiration period total less than year years years after years other commercial commitments operating leases capital leases trade letters of credit unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations and commercial commitments unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
included in the purchase obligations category above are commitments for inventory purchases  capital expenditures  information technology and professional services 
most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice usually to days 
amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above 
as of july   there were no cash borrowings outstanding under the line of credit 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the recent past 
however  we cannot assure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
risks that may affect results factors that might cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements discussed elsewhere in this report  as well as affect our ability to achieve our financial and other goals  include  but are not limited to  the following risks relating to our business the success of our business depends in large part on our ability to identify fashion trends as well as to react to changing customer demand in a timely manner 
consequently  we depend in part upon the customer response to the creative efforts of our merchandising  design and marketing teams and their ability to anticipate trends and fashions that will appeal to our consumer base 
if we miscalculate our customers product preferences or the demand for our products  we may be faced with excess inventory 
historically  this type of occurrence has resulted in excess fabric for some products and markdowns and or write offs  which has impaired our profitability  and may do so in the future 
similarly  any failure on our part to anticipate  identify and respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion trends will adversely affect our sales 
if we are unable to obtain raw materials  unable to find manufacturing facilities or our manufacturers perform unacceptably  our sales may be negatively affected and our financial condition may be harmed 
we do not own any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend on contractors and third parties to manufacture our products 
we place all of our orders for production of merchandise and raw materials by purchase order and do not have any long term contracts with any manufacturer or supplier 
if we fail to maintain favorable relationships with our manufacturers and suppliers or are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials on commercially reasonable terms  it could harm our business and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that contractors and third party manufacturers will not supply similar products to our competitors  will not stop supplying products to us completely  or will supply products in a timely manner 
untimely receipt of products may result in markdowns which would have a negative impact on earnings 
furthermore  we have received in the past  and may receive in the future  shipments of products from manufacturers that fail to conform to our quality control standards 
in such event  unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner  we may lose sales 
certain of our third party manufacturers store our raw materials 
in the event our inventory was damaged or destroyed and we were unable to obtain replacement raw materials  our earnings may be negatively impacted 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees in order to support our existing business and future expansion 
from time to time we actively recruit qualified candidates to fill key executive positions from within the company 
there is substantial competition for experienced personnel  which we expect will continue 
we compete for experienced personnel with companies who have greater financial resources than we do 
in the past  we have experienced significant turnover of our executive management team and retail store personnel 
we are also exposed to employment practice litigation due to the large number of employees and high turnover of our sales associates 
if we fail to attract  motivate  and retain qualified personnel  it could harm our business and limit our ability to expand 
in addition  we depend upon the expertise and execution of our key employees  particularly manny mashouf  the founder  chairman of the board  and majority shareholder  and gregory scott  our chief executive officer and member of the board of directors 
if we lose the services of mr 
mashouf  mr 
scott  or any key officers or employees  it could harm our business and results of operations 
if we are not able to successfully expand our bebe and bebe sport stores our revenue base and earnings may be impaired 
we believe that there is opportunity to expand the number of bebe and bebe sport stores in new and existing markets 
for fiscal  we plan to grow our operations in a controlled manner  primarily through the opening of new stores 
as part of our growth strategy  we will also open larger bebe stores and accessory shop in shops 
if these stores are not successful  our financial condition may be harmed 
there can be no assurance that future store openings will be successful and new store openings may impact existing stores 
we expect to open approximately stores in fiscal  of which approximately will be bebe stores  approximately will be bebe sport stores and approximately three will be outlet stores 
in the past  we have closed stores as a result of poor performance  and there can be no assurance that the stores that we plan to open in fiscal  or any other stores that we might open in the future  will be successful or that our overall operating profit will increase as a result of opening these stores 
during fiscal we closed stores and during fiscal  we anticipate closing four stores 
most of our new store openings in fiscal will be in existing markets 
these openings may affect the existing stores net sales and profitability 
our failure to predict accurately the demographic or retail environment at any future store location could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to risks associated with our on line sales 
we operate an on line store at www 
bebe 
com to sell our merchandise  which we plan to migrate to a third party platform in fiscal although our online sales encompass a relatively small percentage of our total sales  our on line operations are subject to numerous risks  including unanticipated operating problems  reliance on third party computer hardware and software providers  system failures and the need to invest in additional computer systems 
the on line operations also involve other risks that could have an impact on our results of operations including  but not limited to  diversion of sales from our other stores  rapid technological change  liability for online content  credit card fraud  risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate the website and its related support systems 
in addition  with the migration to a third party we will no longer have direct control of our on line business 
there can be no assurance that our on line store will continue to achieve sales and profitability growth or even remain at its current level 
any serious disruption at our major facilities could have a harmful effect on our business 
we currently operate a corporate office in brisbane  california  a distribution facility in benicia  california  and a design studio and production facility in los angeles  california 
any serious disruption at these facilities whether due to construction  relocation  fire  earthquake  terrorist acts or otherwise would harm our operations and could have a harmful effect on our business and results of operations 
furthermore  we have little experience operating essential functions away from our main corporate offices and are uncertain what effect operating such satellite facilities might have on business  personnel and results of operations 
we rely on information technology  the disruption of which could adversely impact our business 
we rely on various management information systems to manage our operations and regularly make investments to upgrade  enhance or replace such systems 
for example  we recently implemented a customer loyalty program to be used in conjunction with our direct marketing initiatives and in fiscal year we plan to implement an enhanced production system supporting our design  manufacturing and merchandising needs 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful with the implementation of this and other new systems 
any delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems  or in integrating them with our current systems  or any other disruptions affecting any of our management information systems  could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face significant competition in the retail and apparel industry  which could harm our sales and profitability 
the retail and apparel industries are highly competitive and are characterized by low barriers to entry 
key competitors include  but are not limited to arden b  bcbg  express  guess  and the tbd and savvy departments within nordstrom 
we expect competition in our markets to increase 
the primary competitive factors in our markets are brand name recognition  sourcing  product styling  quality  presentation and pricing  timeliness of product development and delivery  store ambiance  customer service and convenience 
we compete with traditional department stores  specialty store retailers  business to consumer websites  off price retailers and direct marketers for  among other things  raw materials  market share  retail space  finished goods  sourcing and personnel 
because many of these competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial  distribution and marketing resources than we do  we may lack the resources to adequately compete with them 
if we fail to compete in any way  it could harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
purchases of the merchandise we sell are generally discretionary and are therefore particularly susceptible to economic conditions 
the outlook for the united states economy is uncertain and is directly affected by factors that are beyond our control 
such factors include disposable consumer income  oil prices  recession and fears of recession  war and fears of war  inclement weather  consumer debt  interest rates  sales tax rates  consumer confidence in future economic conditions and political conditions  and consumer perceptions of personal well being and security 
consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases  including purchases of fashion products  during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail 
if economic conditions change  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
while the temporary closure of our three stores that were directly affected by hurricane katrina will not have a material impact on our operating results  we cannot predict the indirect effects such as rising oil and freight prices  consumer spending  or other economic factors that this  or any other natural disasters will have on our results of operations 
our business could be adversely impacted by unfavorable international conditions 
due to our international operations  our sales and operating results are  and will continue to be  affected by international social  political  legal and economic conditions 
in particular  our business could be adversely impacted by instability or changes resulting in the disruption of trade with the countries in which our contractors  suppliers or customers are located  significant fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies or restrictions on the transfer of funds  or additional trade restrictions imposed by the united states and other foreign governments 
trade restrictions  including increased tariffs or quotas  embargoes  and customs restrictions could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are not able to successfully protect our intellectual property our ability to capitalize on the value of our brand name may be impaired 
even though we take actions to establish  register and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights  we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that others will not imitate our products or infringe upon our intellectual property rights 
in addition  there is no assurance that others will not resist or seek to block the sale of our products as infringements of their trademark and proprietary rights 
we are seeking to register our trademarks domestically and internationally 
obstacles may exist that may prevent us from obtaining a trademark for the bebe name or related names 
we may not be able to register certain trademarks  purchase the right or obtain a license to use the bebe name or related names on commercially reasonable terms 
if we fail to obtain trademark  ownership or license the requisite rights  it would limit our ability to expand 
in some jurisdictions  despite successful registration of our trademarks  third parties may allege infringement and bring actions against us 
in addition  if our licensees fail to use our intellectual property correctly  the reputation and value associated with our trademarks may be diluted 
furthermore  if we do not demonstrate use of our trademarks  our trademark rights may lapse over time 
if an independent manufacturer violates labor or other laws  or is accused of violating any such laws  or if their labor practices diverge from those generally accepted as ethical  it could harm our business and brand image 
while we maintain a policy to monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers by having an independent firm inspect these manufacturing sites  and all manufacturers are contractually required to comply with such labor practices  we cannot control the actions or the public s perceptions of such manufacturers  nor can we assure that these manufacturers will conduct their businesses using ethical or legal labor practices 
apparel companies can be held jointly liable for the wrongdoings of the manufacturers of their products 
while we do not control their employees employment conditions or the manufacturers business practices  and the manufacturers act in their own interest  they may act in a manner that results in negative public perceptions of us and or employee allegations or court determinations that we are jointly liable 
risks relating to our common stock our stock price may fluctuate because of the small number of shares that can be publicly traded and the low average daily trading volumes 
the vast majority of our outstanding shares of our common stock are subject to trading restrictions 
as of july   approximately  shares of our common stock were available to be publicly traded  and as a result  our average daily trading volumes are relatively low  and our stock price is vulnerable to market swings due to large purchases  sales and short sales of our common stock 
our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail and apparel industries  such as the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales 
as a result  our stores typically generate a higher percentage of our annual net sales and profitability in the second quarter of our fiscal year which includes the holiday selling season compared to other quarters 
such seasonal and quarterly fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
because a principal shareholder controls the company  other shareholders may not be able to influence the direction the company takes 
as of july   manny mashouf  the chairman of the board  beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  he alone can control the election of directors and the outcome of all issues submitted to the shareholders 
this may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire shares  may discourage acquisition bids  and could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of common stock 
this concentration of stock ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
we currently maintain a portfolio of variable investments consisting of cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities 
marketable securities are comprised of closed end variable interest rate funds that invest primarily in tax exempt municipal bonds 
due to the variable nature of these investments  their value is typically not subject to market rate changes 
according to our investment policy  we may invest in taxable and tax exempt instruments 
in addition  the policy establishes limits on credit quality  maturity  issuer and type of instrument 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents 
auction rate securities have stated maturities beyond one year but are priced and traded as short term instruments due to the liquidity provided through the interest rate reset mechanism and are classified as short term when they represent investments of cash that are intended for use in current operations 
in prior years  the company had classified auction rate securities as cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets 
as of july   auction rate securities are classified as investments and to conform to the current period presentation  the company has reclassified million of auction rate securities from cash equivalents to short term investments as of june  the following table lists our cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities at july  book value fair value dollars in thousands cash equivalents weighted average interest rate short term marketable securities weighted average interest rate long term marketable securities weighted average interest rate total represents the weighted average interest rates for tax exempt municipal bonds  municipal preferreds  corporate preferreds and taxable and tax exempt institutional money market instruments 
the interest payable on our bank line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates rose significantly  our results from operations and cash flows would not be affected since we have no outstanding borrowings 
foreign currency risks 
we enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the us  substantially all of which are negotiated and settled in us dollars and  therefore  we have minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
we also operate a subsidiary for which the functional currency is the canadian dollar 
fluctuations in exchange rates therefore impact our financial condition and results of operations  as reported in us dollars 
to date  we have not experienced any significant negative impact as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency markets 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial
