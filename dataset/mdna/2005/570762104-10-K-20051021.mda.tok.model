item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to factors that have affected our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december   and in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis  you should also read our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
recent developments during the year ended december   we discontinued our exploration and production business 
through a series of dispositions  we sold off substantially all of our us and canadian oil and gas properties 
for the years ended december  and  revenues from our discontinued operations were million and million  respectively  and income loss from discontinued operations before income taxes was million and million  respectively 
the dispositions were as follows sales of san juan basin properties during the second and third quarters of  we completed the sale of our san juan basin us oil and gas properties for net proceeds aggregating approximately million 
we recognized an aggregate net pretax gain of million on these sales for the year ended december  the proceeds from the sales were used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
sales of canadian properties during december  we completed the sales of all of our canadian oil and gas properties for net proceeds aggregating approximately million 
we recognized an aggregate pretax loss of million on these sales for the year ended december  the proceeds from the sales were primarily used to pay off our remaining outstanding debt  exclusive of markwest energy s debt 
sale of eastern michigan properties during december  we completed the sale of certain oil and gas properties and related assets located in eastern michigan for net proceeds of less than million 
we recognized a pretax loss of million on the sale 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we classified our operations into two reportable segments exploration and production and gathering  processing and marketing 
with the formation and initial public offering of markwest energy the initial public offering closed on may   the subsequent change to the structure of our internal organization and discontinuance of our exploration and production business in  the composition of our reportable segments changed 
currently  our operations are classified into two reportable segments  managing markwest energy and marketing 
during the year ended december   we also continued to transform markwest hydrocarbon into a company focused on growing markwest energy 
during and  markwest energy completed a number of acquisitions of midstream assets 
markwest energy acquisitions east texas system acquisition 
in july  the partnership acquired natural gas gathering and processing assets located in east texas for million 
the assets consisted of approximately miles of natural gas gathering system pipelines  natural gas gathering system pipelines currently under construction  centralized compressor stations representing  horsepower of compression and a natural gas processing facility  also currently under construction 
hobbs lateral pipeline acquisition 
in april  the partnership acquired a lateral pipeline in hobbs  new mexico for approximately million 
the hobbs lateral consists of a four mile segment of inch and inch natural gas pipeline connecting the northern natural gas interstate pipeline to southwestern public service s cunningham and maddox power generating stations in hobbs  new mexico 
the hobbs lateral was recently expanded to a capacity of approximately mmcf d and throughput was approximately mmcf d for the nine months ended december  since its acquisition 
michigan crude pipeline acquisition 
on december   the partnership completed the acquisition of approximately miles of intrastate crude oil gathering pipeline  for million in cash 
the pipeline serves over  oil and gas wells on the niagaran reef trend and has  barrels of storage capacity in storage tanks 
this acquisition further diversifies the partnership s lines of business with the addition of crude oil gathering and transportation services 
the acquisition also provides the partnership with the opportunity to leverage off its existing infrastructure and personnel in michigan while adding additional fee based cash flows 
western oklahoma acquisition 
on december   markwest energy completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of american central western oklahoma gas company  llc for approximately million in cash 
these assets include miles of natural gas gathering pipeline  known as the foss lake gathering system  and the associated arapaho gas processing plant in western oklahoma 
the foss lake gathering system  which  as of december   had a capacity of mmcf d  connects to approximately wells 
the arapaho gas processing plant  as of december   had a capacity of mmcf d 
by establishing a presence in oklahoma  this acquisition significantly expanded the partnership s southwest operations 
lubbock pipeline acquisition 
effective september   markwest energy completed the acquisition of an intrastate gas transmission pipeline and related assets near lubbock  texas  from power tex joint venture  a subsidiary of conocophillips  for million in cash 
this gas pipeline is the only connection between the northern natural gas and el paso interstate pipelines and the city of lubbock 
this acquisition allowed the partnership to further expand its operations in the southwest with an additional lateral system while providing an added source of fee based cash flows 
pinnacle merger 
on march   the partnership completed the acquisition of pinnacle natural gas company  or pinnacle 
the aggregate purchase price of million was comprised of million in cash plus the assumption of million of bank indebtedness 
the assets are primarily located in texas and include three lateral natural gas pipelines and twenty natural gas gathering systems 
one of the gathering systems was subsequently disposed of in december for an insignificant amount and two of which have been subsequently sold in for proceeds of approximately million 
the three lateral natural gas pipelines consist of approximately miles of pipeline that deliver natural gas under firm contracts to power plants 
this acquisition provided markwest energy with a new area for growth in the southwest and diversified its lines of business and revenues 
initial and subsequent equity offerings of markwest energy partners initial public offering on may   markwest hydrocarbon contributed most of the assets  liabilities and operations of its midstream business to the partnership in exchange for  subordinated units  a general partner interest in the partnership  incentive distribution rights as defined in the partnership agreement  and million in cash which was used to pay down bank debt 
the partnership closed its initial public offering on that date selling  common units including the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option for gross proceeds of million and net proceeds after fees and expenses of million 
concurrent with its initial public offering the partnership borrowed million 
markwest energy s limited partnership structure is designed to reduce its cost of capital thereby enhancing its ability to grow more efficiently 
secondary offering january  on january   the partnership completed a secondary offering of  common units  at per unit for gross proceeds of million 
in addition  of the  common units available to underwriters to cover over allotments   were sold for gross proceeds of million 
aggregate gross proceeds of million were reduced by underwriters fees of million and professional fees and other offering costs of million  resulting in net proceeds of million 
the net proceeds of million and the million contributed by the general partner to maintain its interest resulted in total net proceeds associated with the offering of million 
the funds were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the partnership s credit facility 
secondary offering september  on september   the partnership priced its offering of  common units at per unit 
of the  common units   were sold by the partnership for gross proceeds of million 
the remaining  were sold by certain selling unitholders  proceeds of which have been retained by them 
in connection with the over allotment provisions of the underwriting agreement  the partnership issued an additional  common units for gross proceeds of million 
aggregate gross proceeds of million were reduced by underwriters fees of million and professional fees and other offering costs of million  resulting in net proceeds of million 
the net proceeds of million and the million contributed by the general partner to maintain its interest resulted in total net proceeds associated with the offering of million  which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the partnership s amended and restated credit facility 
private placement june and july  the partnership sold  common units in two installments at a price of per unit in a private placement to certain accredited investors 
the first installment of  units was completed on june   for proceeds of approximately million 
the second installment of  units was completed on july   for proceeds of approximately million 
transaction costs for both installments were less than million 
the partnership s general partner paid its pro rata contribution in july after the second installment was completed 
private placement july  the partnership sold  common units in a private placement to certain accredited investors for per common unit that resulted in gross proceeds of million 
the aggregate gross proceeds of million were reduced by offering costs of million resulting in net proceeds of million 
the net proceeds of million and the million contributed by the general partner to maintain its interest resulted in total net proceeds associated with the private placement of million 
our ownership in markwest energy partners as of december   markwest hydrocarbon s partnership interests consisted of the following  subordinated units  representing a limited partner interest in the partnership  and a ownership interest in the general partner of the partnership 
the general partner owns a general partner interest in the partnership 
markwest hydrocarbon s consolidated financial statements reflect the consolidation of markwest energy  with the public unitholders interest being reflected as a non controlling interest in the consolidated statement of operations and in the consolidated balance sheet 
our contracts excluding the revenues and gross margins derived by markwest energy  the majority of our revenues and gross margins are generated from providing processing services  and from our marketing of ngls and  to a lesser extent  natural gas 
as compensation for providing processing services to appalachian producers  we earn a fee and receive title to the ngls produced 
in return  we are required to replace  in dry natural gas  the energy content of the ngls extracted 
this btu replacement obligation is referred to in the industry as a keep whole arrangement 
in keep whole arrangements  our principal cost associated with the arrangement is the replacement of the btus extracted from the gas stream in the form of ngls or consumed as fuel during processing  with dry gas of an equivalent btu content 
the spread between the ngl product sales price and the purchase price of the replacement natural gas with an equivalent btu content is called the frac spread 
in the event natural gas becomes more expensive  on a btu equivalent basis  when compared to the sales price of ngl products  the cost of keeping the producer whole  could result in operating losses 
our keep whole contracts expose us to commodity price risk  both on the sales side of ngls and on the purchase side of natural gas  which may increase the volatility of our marketing results and cash flows 
however  in september   we entered into several new and amended agreements with one of the largest appalachia producers  which allow us to significantly reduce our exposure to commodity price risk for approximately of our keep whole gas volumes 
under these agreements  the company is limited in the amount of costs it would have to pay to the producer in the event natural gas becomes more expensive than ngls  thereby mitigating the risk of incurring operating losses 
markwest energy contracts the partnership generates the majority of its revenues and gross margin from natural gas gathering  processing and transmission  ngl transportation  fractionation and storage  and crude oil gathering and transportation 
in the partnership s current areas of operations  it has a combination of contract types 
in many cases  the partnership provides services under contracts that contain a combination of more than one of the arrangements described below 
while all of these services constitute midstream energy operations  the partnership provides its services pursuant to five different types of contracts fee based contracts 
under fee based contracts  the partnership receives a fee or fees for one or more of the following services gathering  processing  and transmission of natural gas  transportation  fractionation and storage of ngls  and gathering and transportation of crude oil 
the revenue the partnership earns from these contracts is directly related to the volume of natural gas  ngls or crude oil that flows through its systems and facilities and is not directly dependent on commodity prices 
in certain cases  the contracts provide for minimum annual payments 
to the extent a sustained decline in commodity prices results in a decline in volumes  however  the partnership s revenues from these contracts would be reduced 
percent of proceeds contracts 
under percent of proceeds contracts  the partnership generally gathers and processes natural gas on behalf of producers  sells the resulting residue gas and ngls at market prices and remits to producers an agreed upon percentage of the proceeds based on an index price 
in other cases  instead of remitting cash payments to the producer  markwest energy delivers an agreed upon percentage of the residue gas and ngls to the producer and sells the volumes it keeps to third parties at market prices 
under these types of contracts  the partnership s revenues and gross margins increase as natural gas prices and ngl prices increase  and its revenues and gross margins decrease as natural gas prices and ngl prices decrease 
percent of index contracts 
under percent of index contracts  the partnership generally purchases natural gas at either a percentage discount to a specified index price  a specified index price less a fixed amount or a percentage discount to a specified index price less an additional fixed amount 
markwest energy then gathers and delivers the natural gas to pipelines where it resells the natural gas at the index price 
with respect to and above  the gross margins the partnership realizes under the arrangements decrease in periods of low natural gas prices because these gross margins are based on a percentage of the index price 
conversely  our gross margins increase during periods of rising natural gas prices 
keep whole contracts 
under keep whole contracts  the partnership gathers natural gas from the producer  processes the natural gas and sells the resulting ngls to third parties at market prices 
because the extraction of the ngls from the natural gas during processing reduces the btu content of the natural gas  the partnership must either purchase natural gas at market prices for return to producers or make cash payment to the producers equal to the energy content of this natural gas 
accordingly  under these arrangements  the partnership s revenues and gross margins increase as the price of ngls increase relative to the price of natural gas  and its revenues and gross margins decrease as the price of natural gas increases relative to the price of ngls 
east texas system gathering arrangements 
the partnership gathers volumes on the east texas system under contracts with fee arrangements that are unique to that system 
these contracts typically contain one or more of the following revenue components fixed gathering and compression fees 
typically  gathering and compression fees are comprised of a fixed fee portion in which producers pay a fixed rate per unit to transport their natural gas through the gathering system 
under the majority of these arrangements  fees are adjusted annually based on the consumer price index 
settlement margin 
typically  the terms of the partnership s east texas system gathering arrangements specify that it is allowed to retain a fixed percentage of the volume gathered to cover the compression fuel charges and deemed line losses 
to the extent the east texas system is operated more efficiently than provided for by contracted allowances  markwest energy is entitled to retain the difference for its own account 
condensate sales 
during the gathering process  thermodynamic forces contribute to changes in operating conditions of the natural gas flowing through the pipeline infrastructure 
as a result  hydrocarbon dew points are reached  causing condensation of hydrocarbons in the high pressure pipelines 
the east texas system sells the condensate collected in the system at a monthly crude oil based price 
in the partnership s current areas of operations  it has a combination of contract types and limited keep whole arrangements 
in many cases  the partnership provides services under contracts that contain a combination of more than one of the arrangements described above 
the terms of the partnership s contracts vary based on gas quality conditions  the competitive environment at the time the contracts are signed and customer requirements 
our contract mix and  accordingly  our exposure to natural gas and ngl prices  may change as a result of changes in producer preferences  the partnership s expansion in regions where some types of contracts are more common and other market factors 
any change in mix will impact our financial results 
at december   the partnership s primary exposure to keep whole contracts was limited to our arapaho oklahoma processing plant and our east texas processing contracts 
at the arapaho plant inlet  the btu content of the natural gas meets the downstream pipeline specifications  however  we have the option of extracting ngls when the processing margin environment is favorable 
in addition  approximately half  as measured in volumes  of the related gas gathering contracts include additional fees to cover plant operating costs  fuel costs and shrinkage costs in a low processing margin environment 
because of our ability to operate the plant in several recovery modes  including turning it off  coupled with the additional fees provided for in the gas gathering contracts  our overall keep whole contract exposure is limited to a portion of the operating costs of the plant 
for the year ended december   the partnership generated the following percentages of its revenue and gross margin from the following types of contracts fee based percent of proceeds percent of index keep whole total revenue gross margin includes other types of contracts tied to ngl prices 
includes other types of contracts tied to natural gas prices 
includes other types of contracts tied to both ngl and natural gas prices 
restatement of financial statements we have determined that  in certain cases  we did not comply with generally accepted accounting principles in the preparation of our and consolidated financial statements and  accordingly  we have restated our and annual financial statements through the filing of this form k 
the company has also filed form q a s for the first three quarters of to restate its quarterly financial statements for and the restatements result from markwest hydrocarbon s sale of a portion of its subordinated partnership units and interest in the partnership s general partner to certain employees and directors from through markwest hydrocarbon had historically recorded the sale of the subordinated partnership units and interests in the general partner to certain of the company s employees and directors as a sale of an asset 
these arrangements are referred to as the participation plan 
however  the company determined that these transactions should be accounted for as compensatory arrangements  consistent with the guidance in apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and eitf no 
 accounting for stock compensation arrangements with employer loan features under apb opinion no 
this guidance requires the company to record compensation expense based on the market value of the subordinated partnership units and the formula value of the general partner interests held by the employees and directors at the end of each reporting period 
the formula value is the amount markwest hydrocarbon would pay to repurchase the interests if the employee exercises its put option or the company exercises its call option for the interests held by the employees and directors 
in addition to these adjustments  we have also made an adjustment to record natural gas inventory at cost in the fourth quarter of previously  the inventory was incorrectly identified as a pipeline imbalance and was recorded at fair value 
we have also adjusted non controlling interest in consolidated subsidiary to reflect the portion of the restatement adjustments attributable to the non controlling interest in markwest energy partners  and to eliminate the effect of the subordinated units and general partner interests owned by the employees and directors which were previously accounted for as non controlling interest 
income taxes have been adjusted to reflect the tax effect of these restatement adjustments 
the impact of these restatements was to increase net loss by million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in addition  the company has restated its financial position by decreasing its originally reported assets and liabilities and equity by million at december   the details of which are shown in note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k 
the information contained in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations has been changed to reflect these restatement adjustments 
all amounts reported in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are as restated  unless otherwise stated

marketing revenues 
revenues increased million  or  over revenue primarily due to increases in ngl product sale prices and a increase in volumes in appalachia  which combined to increase revenue by approximately million 
in addition  revenue increased million due to the commencement of a wholesale propane marketing business in revenues in was reduced by losses on crude oil derivatives of million  which effects the comparison from year to year 
these increases were offset  in part  by a decrease in third party ngl sales of million as a result of the sale of the two terminals in purchased product costs 
purchased product costs increased million  or  in primarily due to costs from our wholesale propane marketing business introduced in adding million and an increase in product costs from our appalachian natural gas liquids business of million as a result of a increase in volume and an increase in price of 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease in third party ngl product costs of million as a result of the sale of the two terminals in facility expenses 
facility expenses decreased by approximately million  or  as a result of a decrease in costs associated with two terminals in appalachia that were sold in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  as a result of stock option compensation of million  increased incentive compensation and severance related expenses of million and an increase in sarbanes oxley compliance expenses and audit fees of million 
in addition  compensation expense resulting from the sale of the subordinated partnership units and interests in the general partner to certain of markwest hydrocarbon s employees and directors from through increased selling  general and administrative expenses by million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses attributed to discontinued operations that were sold in depreciation 
the increase in depreciation expense of million  or  was principally due to the increase in software and hardware additions associated with the upgrade of our information technology infrastructure as well as the acceleration of deprecation of our facilities in michigan to more closely match our declining reserves 
impairments 
impairments decreased by million  or  as a result of a write down in the value of the company s remaining western michigan oil and gas operations 
markwest energy revenues 
revenues were higher than our revenues primarily due to the partnership s and acquisitions  which increased its revenues by million 
the increase was also due to higher appalachia ngl product sales prices and volumes  which increased revenues by million 
in addition  higher margins due to higher gas prices in the southwest  along with increased southwest processing margins from an increase in liquid prices  contributed million 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in the partnership s michigan pipeline throughput volumes  which decreased revenue by million 
purchased product costs 
purchased product costs were higher in by million primarily due to the partnership s late and acquisitions  which increased its purchased product costs by million 
the remainder of the increase is primarily attributable to price and volume increases for our appalachia ngl product sales 
price increases contributed million and volume increases contributed an additional million to purchased product costs 
facility expenses 
facility expenses increased approximately million during relative to the same period in primarily due to the partnership s and acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million during the year ended december  compared to because markwest hydrocarbon was contractually limited in the amount it could charge the partnership to million annually  from may   the date of the partnership s initial public offering  through may  in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses have increased due to increased administrative costs of million associated with the partnership s acquisitions  increased sarbanes oxley compliance related expenses and audit fees of million  an increase in incentive compensation and severance expense of million and professional services costs of million 
in addition  the allocation of compensation expense to the partnership resulting from the sale of the subordinated partnership units and interests in the partnership s general partner to certain of markwest hydrocarbon s employees and directors from through increased selling  general and administrative expenses by million 
the charge did not affect management s determination of the partnership s distributable cash flow for any period  and did not affect net income attributed to the limited partners 
depreciation 
depreciation expense increased during primarily due to the partnership s and acquisitions  which increased depreciation by approximately million 
additionally  commencing january  the partnership accelerated the rate of depreciation of its michigan gathering pipeline and processing plant by reducing the estimated useful lives of the related assets from years to years to more closely match expected lives of contractually dedicated reserves behind the partnership s facilities 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization expense increased during primarily due to the east texas system acquisition in july on july   the partnership completed the acquisition of american central eastern texas carthage gathering system and gas processing assets located in east texas for approximately million 
of the total purchase price  million was allocated to customer contracts  of which million was amortized during impairments 
during the fourth quarter of  the partnership recorded a write off of million of costs associated with an isomerization unit taken out of service 
during the fourth quarter of  the partnership s general partner s board of directors approved a plan to replace the partnership s existing cobb extraction facility with a new facility 
consequently  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the partnership wrote down the carrying value of the current cobb facility by million to its estimated fair value 
other income and expenses interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  during relative to primarily due to increased debt levels resulting from the partnership s financing of its and acquisitions 
a significant amount of the partnership s acquisitions were financed through additional borrowings under its credit facility and the issuance of its senior notes 
amortization of deferred financing costs 
the increase in amortization of deferred financing costs in relative to primarily is attributable to the debt refinancings completed in as well as an increase in deferred financing cost as a result of the issuance of the partnership s senior notes 
during  we amortized approximately million of deferred financing costs related to debt issuance costs incurred to finance the partnership s acquisitions  of which million represented accelerated amortization due to the refinancing of the partnership s credit facility in july and again in october deferred financing costs are being amortized over the estimated term of the related obligations  which approximates the effective interest method 
dividend income 
dividend income increased to million during as a result of investments in marketable securities of midstream master limited partnerships 
the company did not have these investments in income from discontinued operations 
the income from discontinued operations in is primarily attributable to the net gain on sales of our oil and gas properties during provision benefit for income taxes 
the company s results of operations reflected a million provision for compared to a million benefit for the change was due primarily to the million increase in earnings from continuing operations  including non controlling interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary 
non controlling interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary 
non controlling interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary increased by million  or  as a result of the increase in earnings of markwest energy and an increase in ownership of non controlling interests commensurate with private placements and public offerings to finance acquisitions

marketing revenues 
the increase of million  or  to revenues was primarily due to a million increase in our ngl products sales prices in appalachia offset by approximately million in hedge losses above levels 
purchased product costs 
purchased product costs increased by million  or  in primarily due to an increase in the weighted average price of our appalachian replacement natural gas from our keep whole and percent of proceeds contract based business 
facility expenses 
facility expenses increased million during primarily due to the partnership s acquisitions  which added million 
increased fuel expenses in appalachia and increased throughput at the partnership s michigan operations also increased facility expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  because markwest hydrocarbon was contractually limited in the amount it could charge the partnership to million annually  from may   the date of the partnership s initial public offering  through may  in addition  the allocation of compensation expense to the partnership resulting from the sale of subordinated partnership units and interests in the general partner to certain of markwest hydrocarbon s employees and directors from through increased selling  general and administrative expenses by million 
depreciation 
the increase in depreciation expense of million  or  was principally due to computer and software additions related to the upgrade of our information technology infrastructure 
impairments 
impairments decreased by million  or  as a result of a write down in the value of the company s remaining western michigan oil and gas operations 
markwest energy revenues 
the partnership s revenues were higher than its revenues primarily due to its acquisitions  which increased its revenues by million  partially offset by the impact of the terms of the new contracts entered into by the partnership with markwest hydrocarbon concurrent with the closing of its may initial public offering 
purchased product costs 
purchased product costs were higher in by million primarily due to the partnership s acquisitions  which increased its purchased product costs by million  partially offset by the impact of the terms of the new contracts entered into by the partnership with markwest hydrocarbon concurrent with the closing of its may initial public offering

depreciation 
depreciation expense increased million  or  during primarily due to the partnership s acquisitions 
impairments 
during the fourth quarter of  the partnership s general partner s board of directors approved a plan to replace its existing cobb extraction facility with a new facility 
consequently  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the partnership wrote down the carrying value of the current cobb facility by million to its estimated fair value 
other income and expenses interest expense 
the increase to interest expense of million  or  was primarily attributable to borrowings by markwest energy to finance its acquisitions 
amortization of deferred financing costs 
amortization of deferred financing costs was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of 
the write down of deferred financing costs eliminated the remaining deferred financing costs associated with the markwest hydrocarbon credit facility that was terminated in december income from discontinued operations 
the increase to income from discontinued operations is primarily attributable to the net gain on sales of our oil and gas properties during income tax benefit 
income tax benefit increased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  due primarily to the million increase in loss from continuing operations  including non controlling interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary 
non controlling interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary 
non controlling interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary increased by million  or  as a result of the increase in earnings of markwest energy and an increase in ownership of non controlling interests commensurate with private placements and public offerings to finance acquisitions 
seasonality a portion of our revenue and  as a result  our gross margin  is dependent upon the sales prices of natural gas and ngl products  particularly propane  and the purchase price of natural gas  both of which fluctuate with winter weather conditions  and other changes in supply and demand 
the strongest demand for propane and the highest propane sales margins generally occur during the winter heating season 
as a result  we historically recognize a significant amount of our annual income during the first and fourth quarters of the year 
liquidity and capital resources markwest hydrocarbon our primary source of liquidity to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures is cash flow from operations  principally from the marketing of natural gas and ngls  and quarterly distributions received from markwest energy 
based on current volume  price and expense assumptions  we expect cash on hand  cash flow from operations and distributions from the partnership to fund our operations and capital expenditures in most of our future capital expenditures are discretionary in nature 
during  we have budgeted million for capital expenditures  consisting principally of computer hardware and software 
we had million in unrestricted cash on hand and million in marketable securities at december   exclusive of markwest energy s million cash on hand 
exclusive of markwest energy s debt  we had no debt outstanding as of december  in february  we disbursed approximately million to pay a special one time dividend of per share to our common stockholders 
in may  we disbursed approximately million to pay the first quarter dividend of per common share to our common shareholders 
on august   we disbursed approximately million to pay the second quarter dividend of per share to our common stockholders 
on december   we disbursed approximately million to pay the third quarter dividend of per share of our common stock 
on january   our board of directors announced that it declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of our common stock 
the dividend was paid on february   to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on february  we disbursed million to pay this dividend 
on april   our board of directors announced that it declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of our common stock 
the dividend was paid on may   to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on may  we disbursed million to pay this dividend 
on july   our board of directors announced that it declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of our common stock 
the dividend was paid on august  to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on august  we disbursed million to pay this dividend 
we own of the general partner of markwest energy 
the general partner of markwest energy owns the general partner interest and all of the incentive distribution rights 
the incentive distribution rights entitle us to receive an increasing percentage of cash distributed by the partnership as certain target distribution levels are reached 
specifically  they entitle us to receive of all cash distributed in a quarter after each unit has received for that quarter  of all cash distributed after each unit has received for that quarter and of all cash distributed after each unit has received for that quarter 
for the year ended december   we received million in distributions for our subordinated units  and the general partner received million  including million representing payments on incentive distribution rights 
if the partnership continues to grow and increase its quarterly distributions per limited partner unit  we expect our distributions to increase accordingly 
if the partnership distribution remains at its current level of per limited unit per quarter  we expect to receive million in distributions for our subordinated units and we expect the general partner to receive million  including million representing payments on incentive distribution rights  for the year ended december  cash flows generated from our marketing operations are subject to volatility in energy prices  especially prices for ngls and natural gas 
our cash flows are enhanced in periods when the prices received for ngls are high relative to the price of natural gas we purchase to satisfy our keep whole contractual arrangements in appalachia  and are reduced in periods when the prices received for ngls are low relative to the price of natural gas we purchase to satisfy such contractual arrangements 
under keep whole contracts  we retain and sell the ngls produced in our processing operations for third party producers  and then reimburse or keep whole the producers for the energy content of the ngls removed through the re delivery to the producers of an equivalent amount on a btu basis of dry natural gas 
generally  the value of the ngls extracted is greater than the cost of replacing those btus with dry gas  resulting in positive operating margins under these contracts 
periodically  when natural gas becomes more expensive  on a btu equivalent basis  than ngl products  the cost of keeping the producer whole can result in operating losses 
we entered into several new and amended agreements in september with one of the largest appalachia producers that allow us to significantly reduce our exposure to commodity price risk for approximately of our keep whole gas volumes 
under these agreements  the company is limited on the amount of costs it would have to pay to the producer in the event natural gas becomes more expensive than ngl product sales price  thereby mitigating the risk of incurring operating losses 
in connection with these agreements  we paid million of consideration to the producer that is being amortized as additional cost of the gas purchased over the term of the contracts  october  through february  for the year ended december   our loss from continuing operations before income taxes was million compared with a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of million for the same period in the improvement in income from operations was due  in part  to a favorable pricing environment in debt on october   we entered into a million senior credit facility with a term of one year 
the million revolving facility has a variable interest rate based on the base rate  which is equal to the higher of a the federal funds rate plus of  and b the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by the administrative agent as its prime rate  plus the applicable rate  which is based on a utilization percentage 
the amount available to be drawn under the credit facility is based upon the amount of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
we are required to pay a commitment fee equal to the applicable rate as defined in the agreement and determined by a utilization percentage times the actual daily amount by which the aggregate commitment exceeds the sum of i the outstanding amount of loans plus ii the outstanding amount of our letter of credit obligations 
substantially all of our assets and our subsidiaries other than excluded markwest energy s entities are pledged to the lender to secure the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
the proceeds from this facility are expected to be used to finance inventory and accounts receivable and to support letters of credit issued by the lender 
in connection with the credit facility  we are subject to a number of restrictions on our business  including restrictions on our ability to grant liens on assets  merge  consolidate or sell assets  incur indebtedness  make acquisitions  engage in other businesses  enter into operating leases  enter into certain swap contracts  engage in transactions with affiliates  make dispositions  make restricted payments  distributions and redemptions and other usual and customary covenants 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings and we had a borrowing capacity of million 
at december   million of this facility was used for a letter of credit issued in support of one of our producer agreements 
the credit facility also contains covenants requiring the company to maintain a positive consolidated ebitda including cash distributions from the partnership for the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently completed  a minimum net worth of million plus of proceeds of equity issued subsequent to october   and a minimum available cash and marketable securities reserve of million  which is to be reduced to zero in the event we restructure a keep whole contract restructuring with one of our significant customers 
as we were unable to deliver our audited consolidated financial statements within days of december   we were not in compliance with our debt covenants 
the lending institutions have waived the delivery requirement until november  we believe that cash on hand  cash received from quarterly distributions including the incentive distribution rights from markwest energy  and projected cash generated from our marketing operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and fund our required capital expenditures  if any  for the next months 
cash generated from our marketing operations will depend on our operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing commodity prices and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
markwest energy overview the partnership s primary source of liquidity to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures other than for larger acquisitions is cash flow from operations 
the public and institutional markets have been the partnership s principal source of capital to finance a majority of its growth including acquisitions 
during  the partnership increased its capital through the issuance of million of additional equity and million of long term fixed rate debt 
since the partnership has sold debt and equity in both public and private offerings in the past  the partnership expects that these sources of capital will continue to be available to it in the future as it continues to grow and expand its operations 
however  we caution that ready access to capital on reasonable terms and the availability of desirable acquisition targets at attractive prices are subject to many uncertainties 
the partnership s objective is to maintain a capital structure with approximately equal amounts of debt and equity 
at december   the partnership had long term debt outstanding of million 
total partners capital at that date was million  which resulted in a long term debt to total capital ratio of 
equity during january  the partnership completed a secondary public offering of  of common units  at per unit for gross proceeds of million 
in addition  of the  common units available to underwriters to cover over allotments   were sold for gross proceeds of million 
to maintain its interest  the general partner of the partnership contributed million 
total gross proceeds were million less associated offering costs of million netting the partnership approximately million 
as approximately million of the offering costs had been incurred during fiscal  net cash generated from the offering during was approximately million 
the funds were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the partnership s credit facility 
during july  the partnership completed a private placement of  common units  at per unit for gross proceeds of million 
to maintain its interest  the general partner contributed million 
total gross proceeds were million less associated offering costs of million netting the partnership approximately million  which were used to finance the east texas system acquisition 
on september   the partnership completed a secondary public offering of  common units at per unit for gross proceeds of million and  common units were sold by certain selling unitholders 
of the  common units sold by the partnership   common units were sold pursuant to the underwriter s over allotment option 
the partnership did not receive any proceeds from the common units sold by the selling unitholders 
the partnership s total net proceeds from the offering  after deducting transaction costs of million and including its general partner s capital contribution of million to maintain its interest  were million  which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the partnership s amended and restated credit facility 
the inability of the partnership to file its annual report on form k for the year ended december  and its quarterly report on form q for the quarterly periods ending march  and june  on time may impact the timing of the partnership s efforts to raise equity in the future 
the partnership will no longer have the ability to incorporate by reference information from its filings into a new registration statement for one year following the later of the filing of this form k and its form q if the partnership seeks to raise capital through a public offering of registered debt or equity securities 
if the partnership raises additional capital through public debt or equity offerings  the partnership will be required to file a form s registration statement  which is a long form type of registration statement 
the requirement to file a form s registration statement may affect the partnership s ability to access the capital markets on a timely basis and may increase the costs of doing so 
the partnership has the ability to issue an unlimited number of units to fund immediately accretive acquisitions 
under the provisions of the partnership agreement  an immediately accretive acquisition is one that in the general partner s good faith determination would have  if acquired by the partnership as of the date that is one year prior to the first day of the quarter in which such acquisition is consummated  resulted in an increase to the amount of operating surplus generated by the partnership on a per unit basis for all outstanding units with respect to each of the four most recently completed quarters on a pro forma basis as compared to the actual amount of operating surplus generated by the partnership on a per unit basis for all outstanding units  excluding operating surplus generated by the partnership on a per unit basis for all outstanding units  excluding operating surplus attributable to the acquisition with respect to each of such four most recently completed quarters 
during and  the partnership consummated six acquisitions aggregating approximately million that were partially funded by equity and debt offerings 
for acquisitions that are not immediately accretive  the partnership has the ability to issue up to  common units without unitholder approval 
debt credit facility 
the partnership amended and restated its credit facility in july  increasing the maximum lending limit from million to million 
the proceeds from the secondary public offering and borrowings under the credit facility were used to finance the east texas system acquisition 
the credit facility included a million revolving facility and a million term loan facility 
the term loan portion of the amended and restated credit facility was originally scheduled to mature in december and the revolving portion was originally scheduled to mature in may on october   the credit facility was  once again  amended and restated  thereby decreasing the maximum lending limit from million to million and increasing the term of the facility to five years 
the credit facility includes a revolving facility up to million subject to the restrictive covenants discussed below with the potential to increase the maximum lending limit to million 
the credit facility matures on october  at that time  the credit facility terminates and all outstanding amounts thereunder are due and payable 
the credit facility is guaranteed by the partnership and all of its present and future subsidiaries and is collateralized by substantially all of its existing and future assets and those of its subsidiaries 
at the partnership s option  the borrowing under the credit facility bears interest at a variable interest rate based either i libor plus an applicable margin  which is fixed at a rate of for the first two quarters following the closing of the credit facility or ii base rate as defined for any day  a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the higher of a the federal funds rate plus of or b the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by the administrative agent of the debt as its prime rate plus an applicable margin  which is fixed at a rate of for the first two quarters following the closing of the credit facility 
after that period  the applicable margin adjusts quarterly based on the partnership s ratio of funded debt to ebitda as defined in the agreement 
the partnership incurs a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facility at a rate ranging from to basis points based upon the ratio of the partnership s consolidated funded debt as defined in the partnership credit facility to consolidated ebitda as defined in the partnership credit facility for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters 
for the years ended december  and  the weighted average interest rate was and  respectively 
under the provisions of the credit facility  the partnership is subject to a number of restrictions on its business  including restrictions on its ability to grant liens on assets  make or own certain investments  enter into swap contracts other than in the ordinary course of business  merge  consolidate or sell assets  incur indebtedness other than subordinated indebtedness  make acquisitions  engage in other businesses  enter into capital or operating leases  engage in transactions with affiliates  make distributions on equity interests  declare or make  directly or indirectly any restricted payments 
in addition  the partnership is subject to certain financial maintenance covenants  including its ratios of total debt to ebitda  total senior secured debt to ebitda  ebitda to interest and a minimum net worth requirement 
failure to comply with the provisions of any of these covenants could result in acceleration of the partnership s debt and other financial obligations 
there was no debt outstanding under the facility at december  and  based on the covenants below  the partnership had available borrowing capacity of approximately million 
the covenants are used to calculate the available borrowing capacity on a quarterly basis 
the credit facility also contains covenants requiring the partnership to maintain a ratio of not less than to of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense for the prior four fiscal quarters  a ratio of not more than to of total consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda for the prior four fiscal quarters  a ratio of not more than to of consolidated senior debt to consolidated ebitda for the prior four fiscal quarters  and a minimum net worth of million plus of proceeds of equity issued subsequent to october  as the partnership was unable to deliver its audited consolidated financial statements within days of december   the partnership was not in compliance with its debt covenants 
the lending institutions for the credit facility waived the day delivery requirement until june  the partnership s form k for the year ended december  and its quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of were filed on june  senior notes 
on october   the partnership and its subsidiary markwest energy finance corporation issued million of senior notes at a fixed rate of and with a maturity date of november  pursuant to rule a and regulation s under the securities act of subject to compliance with certain covenants  the partnership may issue additional notes from time to time under the indenture 
interest on the notes accrues at the rate of per year and is payable semi annually in arrears on may and november  commencing on may  the partnership may redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after november  at certain redemption prices together with accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption  and the partnership may redeem all of the notes at any time prior to november  at a make whole redemption price 
in addition  prior to november   the partnership may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a specified redemption price 
if the partnership sells certain assets and does not reinvest the proceeds or repay senior indebtedness  or if the partnership experiences specific kinds of changes in control  the partnership must offer to repurchase notes at a specified price 
each of the partnership s existing subsidiaries  other than markwest energy finance corporation  has guaranteed the notes jointly and severally and unconditionally 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations equal in right of payment with all of the partnership s existing and future senior debt 
these notes are senior in right of payment to all of the partnership s future subordinated debt but effectively junior in right of payment to the partnership s secured debt to the extent of the assets securing the debt  including its obligations in respect of the partnership s credit facility 
the proceeds from these notes were used to pay down the partnership s outstanding debt under its credit facility 
the indenture governing the senior notes limits the activity of the partnership and its restricted subsidiaries 
the indenture places limits  on the ability of the partnership and the restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  declare or pay dividends or distributions or redeem  repurchase or retire equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  make investments  incur liens  create any consensual limitation on the ability of the restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends  make loans or transfer property to the partnership  engage in transactions with the partnership s affiliates  sell assets  including equity interest of the partnership s subsidiaries  make any payment on or with respect to  or purchase  redeem  defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any subordinated obligation or guarantor subordination obligation except principal and interest at maturity  and consolidate  merge or transfer assets 
the partnership agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement  or under certain circumstances  a shelf registration statement  pursuant to a registration rights agreement relating to the senior notes 
on february   the partnership filed the exchange offer registration statement relating to the senior notes 
the partnership is offering to exchange up to million aggregate principal amount of new senior notes due that have been registered under the securities act for an equal principal amount of the senior notes 
the partnership failed to complete the exchange offer in the time provided for in the subscription agreements april  and as a consequence is incurring an interest rate penalty of  increasing every days thereafter up to  until such time as the exchange offer is completed 
in addition  the indenture governing the partnership s outstanding senior notes contains restrictions on its ability to make cash distributions 
under the indenture  the partnership is restricted from making distributions a restricted payment if at the time of making the restricted payment  a default or an event of default has occurred and is continuing 
the partnership s failure to file its annual report on form k for the year ended december  and its quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission s rules and regulations constituted a default under the indenture  and the failure to file the form k within thirty days after the april  notice from the indenture trustee constituted an event of default under the indenture 
on may   the partnership paid a cash distribution to unitholders for the first quarter of this cash distribution  made while the event of default for failure to file its form k had occurred and was continuing  constituted a default under the indenture  and this default matured into an event of default thirty days after such restricted payment was made  or june  both of these events of default were cured upon the filing of the partnership s form k and the quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of on june  prior to any declaration of acceleration of the senior notes by the trustee as a result of such events of default 
liquidity requirements the partnership has budgeted million for capital expenditures for the year ending december   exclusive of any acquisitions  consisting of million for expansion capital and million for sustaining capital 
sustaining capital includes expenditures to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the existing operating capacity of the partnership s assets and to extend their useful lives 
expansion capital includes expenditures made to expand or increase the efficiency of the existing operating capacity of the partnership s assets 
expansion capital expenditures include expenditures that facilitate an increase in volumes within the partnership s operations 
we believe that the partnership s available cash  cash provided by operating activities and funds available under the partnership s credit facility will be sufficient to fund the partnership s operating  interest and general and administrative expenses  the partnership s capital expenditures budget  short term contractual obligations and distribution payments at current levels for the foreseeable future 
however  the partnership s ability to finance additional acquisitions will likely require the issuance of additional common units  the expansion of the credit facility  additional debt financing or a combination thereof 
in the event that the partnership desires or needs to raise additional capital  we cannot guarantee that additional funds will be available at times or on terms favorable to the partnership  if at all 
the partnership s ability to pay distributions to its unitholders and to make acquisitions will depend upon the future operating performance  and more broadly  on the availability of debt and equity financing which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
subsequent event on march   the partnership acquired a non operating membership interest in starfish pipeline company  llc  from an affiliate of enterprise products partners  lp for million 
starfish owns the ferc regulated stingray natural gas pipeline and the unregulated triton natural gas gathering system and west cameron dehydration facility  all located in the gulf of mexico and southwestern louisiana 
the acquisition was financed through the partnership s existing credit facility and will be accounted for under the equity method of accounting in the first quarter of cash flows year ended december  as restated as restated in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities see note in notes to consolidated and combined financial statements 
net cash provided by operating activities was higher in than in by million  primarily due to an increase in operating income contributed by the partnership s and acquisitions before certain non cash charges 
the increase is also attributable to higher realized ngl prices and higher volumes 
we expect that overall our ngl volumes will be higher than in  principally due to a full year of activity from the partnership s july east texas acquisition  and that cash provided by operating activities in will exceed levels 
however  a precipitous decline in natural gas or ngl prices in would significantly affect the amount of cash flow that would be generated from operations 
net cash used in investing activities was higher in than by million because of the partnership s two acquisitions  which aggregated approximately million 
we also purchased marketable securities of million in and increased our restricted cash by million 
we used approximately million of cash in for capital expenditures  primarily for the construction of the partnership s new cobb processing replacement facility and construction of new processing plants and gathering systems in east texas to handle the partnership s future contractual commitments 
total cash expenditures for our acquisitions were approximately million 
we also had capital expenditures of million in these expenditures were offset by proceeds of million from the sale of our san juan basin properties  markwest resources canada corp 
and markwest midstream services 
in  we expect to use cash of million for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and we plan to continue to expand the partnership s operations in through acquisitions 
in the first quarter of  the partnership acquired a non operating membership interest in starfish pipeline company  llc for million 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million 
the partnership s equity financings and borrowings under its credit facility and bond offering were primarily responsible for the inflow 
the partnership raised funds through two public offerings and one private offering generating net proceeds of million 
in addition  the company issued a net of million of debt to finance the partnership s two acquisitions 
distributions to the partnership s unitholders and payment of dividends were million 
net cash used in operations during resulted primarily from losses from operations 
the loss from operations was primarily caused by the combination of an unfavorable pricing environment primarily in the first half of and unfavorable crude oil hedges throughout 
net cash flows used in investing activities increased during relative to principally due to property acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities during was primarily the result of borrowings and equity raised through private placements and public offerings by the partnership to fund its acquisitions 
total contractual cash obligations a summary of our total contractual cash obligations as of december   is as follows  in thousands payment due by period type of obligation total obligation due in due in due in thereafter long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations includes interest expense on our senior notes through of million 
annual rent expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies a summary of the significant accounting policies that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is detailed in note of accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
certain of these accounting policies require the use of estimates 
we have identified the following estimates that  in our opinion  are subjective in nature  require the exercise of judgment  and involve complex analysis 
these estimates are based on our knowledge and understanding of current conditions and actions that we may take in the future 
changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events 
subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the long lived assets  including related intangibles  of identifiable business activities for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if impairment has occurred  the amount of impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a provision for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value 
for assets identified to be disposed of in the future  the carrying value of these assets is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell to determine if impairment is required 
until the assets are disposed of  an estimate of the fair value is recalculated when related events or circumstances change 
when determining whether impairment of one of our long lived assets has occurred  we must estimate the undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset or asset group 
our estimate of cash flows is based on assumptions regarding the volume of reserves behind the asset and future ngl product and natural gas prices 
the amount of reserves and drilling activity are dependent in part on natural gas prices 
projections of reserves and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors  including changes in general economic conditions in regions in which our products are located  the availability and prices of ngl products and competing commodities   the availability and prices of natural gas supply  our ability to negotiate favorable marketing agreements  the risks that third party natural gas exploration and production activities will not occur or be successful  our dependence on certain significant customers  producers  gatherers  treaters and transporters of natural gas  and competition from other ngl processors  including major energy companies 
any significant negative variance in any of the above assumptions or factors could materially affect our cash flows  which could require us to record an impairment of an asset 
valuation of intangibles significant judgment is required in establishing the fair value and determining appropriate amortization periods for our intangible assets 
intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the fair values of acquired intangible assets are determined by management using relevant information and assumptions 
fair value is generally calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate  which requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate 
amortization of intangible assets with finite useful lives is recorded over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
at december   we had million of net intangible assets 
an impairment of our intangible assets could result in a material  non cash expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
we apply sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in determining the life of our intangible assets 
in establishing the amortization period for the customer contract intangible asset for the east texas acquisition  which accounts for million of the intangible assets  the partnership considered the life of the assets to which the contracts relate  anticipated drilling activity in the area  likelihood of renewals  competitive factors  regulatory or legal provisions  and maintenance and renewal costs 
as a result of an analysis of these factors  the customer contracts are expected to have an average life of years  including anticipated renewals 
based on an independent third party analysis of the reserves in the area and the pertinent terms of the customer contracts  the partnership has determined that a straight line amortization method is appropriate and representative of the economic benefits of the intangible asset 
because of the significant judgment required in determining the fair value and life and related method of amortization of customer contract intangible assets  actual cash flows could differ significantly from estimated amounts used to determine the fair value  life and amortization method of these intangible assets 
commodity price risk management activities we use commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate our exposure to price fluctuations in crude oil  natural gas and interest rates 
recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction 
results of oil and natural gas derivative transactions are reflected in revenue  and results of interest rate hedging transactions are reflected in interest expense 
the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains losses within revenue or interest expense 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined in sfas  is recognized immediately in earnings 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges  changes in fair value  as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  are recognized currently in earnings 
differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument  if any  represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in earnings 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
one of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives 
we have established the fair value of our derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently evaluated them internally using established index prices and other sources 
these values are based upon  among other things  futures prices  volatility  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at the inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices  the risk we usually hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates  the company s financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
the net market value of our derivatives was a liability of million at december  recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise  or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas no

we have not yet evaluated the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement on our financial statements 
on march   the sec staff issued sab no 
 share based payment  to express the views of the staff regarding the interaction between sfas no

r 
in march  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which clarifies the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
a conditional asset retirement obligation is an unconditional legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
therefore  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation under sfas no 
if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
fin permits  but does not require  restatement of interim financial information 
the provisions of fin are effective for reporting periods ending after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on its consolidated financial statements

this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
the statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
beginning in calendar year management believes that the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
risk factors in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this form k  you should carefully consider the following factors when evaluating markwest hydrocarbon 
risks inherent in our business if we are unable to successfully integrate the partnership s recent or future acquisitions  our future financial performance may be negatively impacted 
our future growth will depend in part on our ability to integrate the partnership s recent acquisitions and the partnership s ability to make future acquisitions of assets and businesses at attractive prices 
the partnership completed the east texas system  western oklahoma and michigan crude pipeline acquisitions  which geographically expanded its operations in the southwest  particularly east texas and oklahoma  and expanded its operations in michigan 
we cannot assure you that the partnership will successfully integrate these or any other acquisitions into its operations  or that the partnership will achieve the desired profitability from such acquisitions 
failure to successfully integrate these substantial or future acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the integration of acquisitions with our existing business involves numerous risks  including operating a significantly larger combined organization and integrating additional midstream operations into our existing operations  difficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired businesses  especially if the assets acquired are in a new business segment or geographical area  the loss of customers or key employees from the acquired businesses  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the failure to realize expected synergies and cost savings  coordinating geographically disparate organizations  systems and facilities  integrating personnel from diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures  and consolidating corporate and administrative functions 
further  unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined  and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition 
following an acquisition  the partnership may discover previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired assets that will be subject to the same stringent environmental laws and regulations relating to releases of pollutants into the environment and environmental protection as the partnership s existing plants  pipelines and facilities 
thus  the operation of these new assets could cause the partnership to incur increased costs to attain or maintain compliance with such laws and regulations 
if the partnership consummates any future acquisition  its capitalization and results of operation may change significantly  and you will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic  financial and other relevant information that the partnership will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources 
the partnership s acquisition strategy is based in part on the partnership s expectation of ongoing divestitures of assets within the midstream industry 
a material decrease in such divestitures will limit the partnership s opportunities for future acquisitions and could adversely affect its operations and cash flows available for distribution to its unitholders including markwest hydrocarbon 
a significant decrease in natural gas production in our areas of operation due to the decline in production from existing wells  depressed commodity prices  reduced drilling activities or other factors otherwise could adversely affect our revenues and operating income and cash flow 
our profitability is materially impacted by the volume of natural gas the partnership gathers  transmits and processes and ngls the partnership transports and fractionates at its facilities 
a material decrease in natural gas production in the partnership s areas of operation would result in a decline in the volume of natural gas delivered to its pipelines and facilities for gathering  transporting and processing and ngls delivered to its pipelines and facility for fractionation and transportation 
the effect of such a material decrease would be to reduce our revenue and operating income 
fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves 
drilling activity generally decreases as oil and natural gas prices decrease 
we have no control over the level of drilling activity in the areas of operations  the amount of reserves underlying the wells and the rate at which production from a well will decline  sometimes referred to as the decline rate 
in addition  we have no control over producers or their production decisions  which are affected by  among other things  prevailing and projected energy prices  demand for hydrocarbons  the level of reserves  geological considerations  governmental regulation and the availability and cost of capital 
failure to connect new wells to the partnership s gathering systems would  therefore  result in the amount of natural gas it gathers  transmits and processes and the amount of ngls the partnership transports and fractionates being reduced substantially over time and could  upon exhaustion of the current wells  cause the partnership to abandon its gathering systems and  possibly  cease gathering operations 
the partnership s ability to connect to new wells will be dependent on the level of drilling activity in its areas of operations and competitive market factors 
as a consequence of such declines  our revenues would be materially adversely affected 
the partnership s substantial debt and other financial obligations could impair the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and the ability to fulfill the partnership s debt obligations 
the partnership has substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations 
subject to the restrictions governing the partnership s indebtedness and other financial obligations and the indenture governing the notes  the partnership may incur significant additional indebtedness and other financial obligations  which may be secured and or structurally senior to the notes 
the partnership s substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could make it more difficult for the partnership to satisfy its obligations with respect to the notes  impair the partnership s ability to obtain additional financings in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes  have a material adverse effect on the partnership if it fails to comply with financial and restrictive covenants in the partnership s debt agreements and an event of default occurs as a result of that failure that is not cured or waived  require the partnership to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow to payments on its indebtedness and other financial obligations  thereby reducing the availability of the partnership s cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  distributions and other general partnership requirements  limit the partnership s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business and the industry in which it operates  and place the partnership at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have proportionately less debt 
these restrictions could limit the partnership s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to obtain future financings  make needed capital expenditures  withstand a future downturn in its business or the economy in general  conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise 
the partnership s existing credit facility contains covenants requiring the partnership to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial conditions 
the partnership may be unable to meet those ratios and conditions 
any future breach of any of these covenants or the partnership s failure to meet any of these ratios or conditions could result in a default under the terms of the partnership s credit facility  which could result in acceleration of its debt and other financial obligations 
if the partnership were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation proceeding or proceed against the collateral 
a material decrease in the supply of crude oil available for transport through the partnership s michigan crude pipeline  or a significant decrease in demand for refined products in the markets served by this pipeline  could adversely affect our revenues and cash flow 
the volume of crude oil the partnership transports through its michigan crude pipeline depends on the availability of crude oil produced in the areas accessible to the partnership s crude oil pipeline 
if there were a material decrease in the volume of crude oil shipped on the pipeline due to reduced production from its shippers  less expensive supplies of crude oil available to the markets served by the partnership s pipeline  competition from trucks or reduced demand for refined product  such events may adversely affect the company s revenues and cash flow from the pipeline operations 
we depend on third parties for the natural gas the partnership processes and the ngls it fractionates at its facilities  and any reduction in these quantities could reduce our revenues and cash flow 
although the partnership obtains the supply of natural gas and ngls from numerous third party producers  a significant portion is supplied by a limited number of key producers suppliers who are committed to us under processing contracts 
however  pursuant to many of these contracts or other supply arrangements  the producers are under no obligation to deliver a specific quantity of natural gas or ngls to the partnership s facilities 
if these key suppliers or a significant number of other producers were to decrease materially the supply of natural gas or ngls to the partnership s systems and facilities for any reason  the partnership could experience difficulty in replacing those lost volumes 
because our operating costs are primarily fixed  a reduction in the volumes of natural gas or ngls delivered to the partnership would result not only in a reduction of revenues but also a decline in net income and cash flow of similar or greater magnitude 
the fees charged to third parties under the partnership s gathering  processing  transmission  transportation  fractionation and storage agreements may not escalate sufficiently to cover increases in costs and the agreements may not be renewed or may be suspended in some circumstances 
the partnership s costs may increase at a rate greater than the rate that the fees it charges to third parties increase pursuant to our contracts with them 
furthermore  third parties may not renew their contracts with the partnership 
additionally  some third parties obligations under their agreements with the partnership may be permanently or temporarily reduced upon the occurrence of certain events  some of which are beyond our control  including force majeure events wherein the supply of either natural gas  ngls or crude oil are curtailed or cut off 
force majeure events include but are not limited to revolutions  wars  acts of enemies  embargoes  import or export restrictions  strikes  lockouts  fires  storms  floods  acts of god  explosions  mechanical or physical failures of equipment or facilities of the partnership or third parties 
if the escalation of fees is insufficient to cover increased costs  if third parties do not renew or extend their contracts with the partnership or if any third party suspends or terminates its contracts with the partnership  our financial results would be negatively impacted 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties  and a general increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by our customers could reduce our revenues and cash flow 
we are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers 
any increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by our customers could reduce our revenues and cash flow 
we may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers  which would reduce our revenues and limit our future profitability 
the renewal or replacement of existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond our control  including competition from other pipelines  and the price of  and demand for  natural gas  ngls and crude oil in the markets we serve 
our competitors include large oil  natural gas  refining and petrochemical companies  some of whom have greater financial resources and access to natural gas and ngl supplies than we do 
additionally  our customers who gather gas through facilities that are not otherwise dedicated to us may develop their own processing and fractionation facilities in lieu of using our services 
certain of our competitors may also have advantages in competing for acquisitions or other new business opportunities because of their financial resources and access to natural gas and ngl supplies 
as a consequence of the increase in competition in the industry and volatility of natural gas prices  end users and utilities are reluctant to enter into long term purchase contracts 
many end users purchase natural gas from more than one natural gas company and have the ability to change providers at any time 
some of these end users also have the ability to switch between gas and alternative fuels in response to relative price fluctuations in the market 
because there are numerous companies of greatly varying size and financial capacity that compete with us in the marketing of natural gas  we often compete in the end user and utilities markets primarily on the basis of price 
the inability of our management to renew or replace our current contracts as they expire and to respond appropriately to changing market conditions could have a negative effect on our profitability 
for more information regarding the competition that we have  please see item competition 
our profitability is affected by the volatility of ngl product and natural gas prices 
the profitability of our operations is affected by volatility in prevailing ngl product and natural gas prices 
changes in the prices of ngl products have historically correlated closely with changes in the price of crude oil 
crude oil  ngl product and natural gas prices have been subject to significant volatility in recent years in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for ngl products and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control  including the level of domestic oil  natural gas and ngl production  imports of crude oil  natural gas and ngls  seasonality  the condition of the us economy  political conditions in other oil producing and natural gas producing countries  and domestic government regulation  legislation and policies 
the gross margins we realize under percent of proceeds and percent of index contracts  as well as our keep whole contracts  are directly affected by changes in ngl product prices and natural gas prices  and are therefore more sensitive to volatility in commodity prices than the fee based contracts 
additionally  changes in natural gas prices may indirectly impact our profitability since prices can influence drilling activity and well operations and thus the volume of gas we gather and process and sell 
in the past  the prices of natural gas and ngls have been extremely volatile  and we expect this volatility to continue 
we are subject to operating and litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance 
our operations are subject to numerous operating hazards and risks incidental to processing  transporting  fractionating and storing natural gas and ngls and to transporting and storing crude oil 
these hazards include damage to pipelines  plants  related equipment and surrounding properties caused by floods and other natural disasters  inadvertent damage from construction and farm equipment  leakage of crude oil  natural gas  ngls and other hydrocarbons  fires and explosions  and other hazards  including those associated with high sulfur content  or sour gas that could also result in personal injury and loss of life  pollution and suspension of operations 
as a result  we may be a defendant in various legal proceedings and litigation arising from our operations 
we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates 
as a result of market conditions  certain insurance premiums and deductibles could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
for example  insurance carriers are now requiring broad exclusions for losses due to war risk and terrorist acts 
if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
transportation on certain of the partnership s pipelines may be subject to federal or state rate and service regulation  and the imposition and or cost of compliance with such regulation could adversely affect our profitability 
some of the partnership s gas  liquids and crude oil transmission operations may be subject to jurisdiction and rate and service regulations of the ferc or of various state regulatory bodies  depending upon the factual circumstances upon which each pipeline s jurisdictional status is based 
ferc generally regulates the transportation of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce  and ferc s regulatory authority also extends to facilities construction  acquisition  extension or abandonment of services or facilities  accounts and records  and depreciation and amortization policies 
intrastate natural gas pipeline operations are generally not subject to regulation by ferc  and some gathering systems are specifically exempted from ferc regulation by the natural gas act nga  but such operations are often subject to regulation by various agencies of the states in which they are located 
the applicable statutes and regulations generally require that the our rate and term and condition of service provide no more than a fair return on the aggregate value of the facilities used to render services  and ferc rate cases can involve complex and expensive proceedings 
the partnership s appalachian pipeline carries ngls across state lines 
the primary shipper on the pipeline is markwest hydrocarbon  who has entered into agreements with the partnership providing for a fixed transportation charge for the term of the agreements  which expire on december  the partnership is the only other shipper on the pipeline 
as the partnership does not operate its appalachian pipeline as a common carrier and does not hold the pipeline out for service to the public generally  there are currently no third party shippers on this pipeline and the pipeline is and will continue to be operated as a proprietary facility and consequently should not be subject to regulation by the ferc 
however  we cannot provide assurance that ferc would not determine that such transportation is within its jurisdiction 
in such a case  the partnership would be required to file a tariff for such transportation with ferc and provide a cost justification for the transportation charge 
markwest hydrocarbon has agreed to not challenge the status of the partnership s appalachian pipeline or the transportation charge during the term of the agreements with markwest hydrocarbon and  moreover  the likelihood of other entities seeking to utilize the partnership s appalachian pipeline is remote 
however  the partnership cannot predict whether an assertion of ferc jurisdiction might be made with respect to this pipeline  nor provide assurance that such an assertion would not adversely affect its results of operations 
with respect to the michigan crude pipeline  one shipper recently contacted ferc to inquire about a transportation rate increase and the pipeline s regulatory rate structure 
in response  ferc requested that the partnership contact the shipper to initiate a discussion with the shipper regarding its questions 
the partnership is presently in discussions with all shippers regarding rate structures and is attempting to resolve any issues they may have 
ferc also requested that the partnership file a tariff 
while the michigan crude pipeline operations are entirely within the state of michigan and have been regulated by the state of michigan  the partnership has calculated and determined that its current and proposed rate structures are well below rates which would be allowed under ferc s cost of service rate making structure 
however  we cannot predict whether a ferc jurisdictional challenge might be made with respect to the michigan crude pipeline  nor provide assurance that such a development would not adversely affect our results of operations or cash flow 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental  safety and other regulatory matters  and the violation of or the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our profitability 
our business is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous governmental agencies that enforce complex and stringent laws and regulations with respect to a wide range of environmental  safety and other regulatory matters 
we could be adversely affected by increased costs due to more strict pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from non compliance with required operating or other regulatory permits 
new environmental laws and regulations might adversely impact our products and activities  including the gathering  processing  transportation  fractionation  and storage of natural gas and ngls and the transportation and storage of crude oil 
federal  state and local agencies also could impose additional safety requirements  any of which could affect our profitability 
in addition  we face the risk of accidental releases or spills associated with our operations  which could result in material costs and liabilities  including those relating to claims for damages to property and persons 
failure by us to comply with environmental or safety related laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations and even the issuance of injunctions that restrict or prohibit the performance of our operations 
for more information regarding the environmental  safety and other regulatory matters that could affect our business  please see item regulatory matters and environmental matters 
we are indemnified for liabilities arising from an ongoing remediation of property on which the partnership s facilities are located and our results of operation and the partnership s ability to make payments of principal and interest on the notes could be adversely affected if the indemnifying party fails to perform its indemnification obligation 
the previous owner operator of the partnership s boldman and cobb facilities has been or is currently involved in investigatory or remedial activities with respect to the real property underlying these facilities pursuant to an administrative order by consent for removal actions with epa regions ii  iii  iv  and v in september and an agreed order entered into with the kentucky natural resources and environmental protection cabinet in october the previous owner operator has agreed to retain sole liability and responsibility for  and indemnify markwest hydrocarbon against  any environmental liabilities associated with the epa administrative order  the kentucky agreed order or any other environmental condition related to the real property prior to the effective dates of markwest hydrocarbon s agreements pursuant to which markwest hydrocarbon leased or purchased the real property 
in addition  the previous owner operator has agreed to perform all the required response actions at its cost and expense in a manner that minimizes interference with markwest hydrocarbon s use of the properties 
on may   markwest hydrocarbon assigned to the partnership the benefit of this indemnity from the previous owner operator 
our results of operation and the partnership s ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders could be adversely affected if in the future the previous owner operator fails to perform under the indemnification provisions of which we are the beneficiary 
the amount of gas the partnership processes  gathers and transmits or the crude oil it gathers and transports may be reduced if the pipelines to which the partnership delivers the natural gas or crude oil cannot or will not accept the gas or crude oil 
all of the natural gas the partnership processes  gathers and transmits is delivered into pipelines for further delivery to end users 
if these pipelines cannot or will not accept delivery of the gas due to downstream constraints on the pipeline  the partnership will be forced to limit or stop the throughput of gas through its pipelines and processing systems 
in addition  interruption of pipeline service upstream of the partnership s processing facilities would likewise limit or stop throughput through its processing facilities 
likewise  if the pipelines into which the partnership delivers crude oil is interrupted  the partnership will be limited in  or prevented from  conducting crude oil transportation operations 
such interruptions or constraints on pipeline service may be caused by any number of factors beyond the partnership s control  including necessary and scheduled maintenance as well as unexpected damage to the pipeline 
since our revenues and gross margin depend upon the volumes of natural gas the partnership processes  gathers and transmits  the throughput of ngls through the partnership s transportation  fractionation and storage facilities and the volume of crude oil it gathers and transports  any such limitation or reduction of volumes could result in a material reduction in our gross margin 
our business would be adversely affected if operations at any of the partnership s facilities were interrupted 
the partnership s operations are dependent upon the infrastructure that it has developed  including processing and fractionation plants  storage facilities and various means of transportation 
any significant interruption at these facilities or pipelines or the partnership s inability to transmit natural gas or ngls  or transport crude oil to or from these facilities or pipelines for any reason would adversely affect our results of operations 
operations at the partnership s facilities could be partially or completely shut down  temporarily or permanently  as the result of any number of circumstances that are not within the partnership s control  such as unscheduled turnarounds or catastrophic events at the physical plants  labor difficulties that result in a work stoppage or slowdown  and a disruption in the supply of crude oil to the partnership s crude oil pipeline  natural gas to its processing plants or gathering pipelines  or a disruption in the supply of ngls to the partnership s transportation pipeline and fractionation facility 
due to the partnership s lack of asset diversification  adverse developments in the partnership s gathering  processing  transportation  transmission  fractionation and storage business would reduce the partnership s ability to make distributions to its unitholders 
we rely on the revenues generated from the partnership s gathering  processing  transportation  transmission  fractionation and storage businesses 
due to the partnership s lack of asset diversification  an adverse development in one of these businesses would have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition and results of operations than if we maintained more diverse assets 
we have found material weaknesses in our internal controls that require remediation and concluded  pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  that our internal controls over financial reporting at december  were not effective 
as we disclose in our management s report on internal control over financial reporting in part ii  controls and procedures  of this form k  we have discovered deficiencies  including material weaknesses  in our internal control over financial reporting 
while we are taking immediate steps to correct our internal control weaknesses  the material weaknesses that have been discovered will not be considered remediated until the new and improved internal controls operate for a period of time  are tested and it is concluded that such new and improved internal controls are operating effectively 
pending the successful completion of such testing and the hiring of additional personnel  we will perform mitigating procedures relating to our internal control weaknesses 
if we fail to remediate any material weaknesses  we could be unable to provide timely and reliable financial information  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  as the company was unable to deliver its audited consolidated financial statements within days of december   the company is not in compliance with its debt covenants for the credit facility 
the lending institutions of our credit facility have waived the delivery requirement until november  the partnership has agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement  or under certain circumstances  a shelf registration statement  pursuant to a registration rights agreement relating to the senior notes 
on february  the partnership filed the exchange offer registration statement relating to the senior notes 
the partnership failed to complete the exchange offer in the time provided for in the subscription agreements and as a consequence is incurring an interest rate penalty of  increasing every days thereafter up to  until such time as the exchange offer is completed 
in addition  the inability of the company and the partnership to file the annual report on form k for the year ended december  on time may impact the timing of the company s and the partnership s ability to raise equity in the future 
we will no longer have the ability to incorporate by reference into the registration statements for one year following the filing of the form k should the company or the partnership choose to raise capital through a public offering of registered debt or equity securities 
in effect  if the company or the partnership raises additional capital through public debt or equity offerings  the company or the partnership will be required to file a form s registration statement  which is a long form type of registration statement 
the requirement to file a form s registration statement may affect our ability or the partnership s ability to access the capital markets on a timely basis and may increase the costs of doing so 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we face market risk from commodity price changes and to a lesser extent interest rate changes 
commodity price through our consolidated subsidiary  markwest energy  we are engaged in the gathering  processing and transmission of natural gas  the transportation  fractionation and storage of ngls and the gathering and transportation of crude oil 
we also market natural gas and ngl products 
our products are commodities that are subject to price risk resulting from material changes in response to fluctuations in supply and demand  general economic conditions and other market conditions  such as weather patterns  over which we have no control 
our primary risk management objective is to reduce volatility in our cash flows 
a committee  which includes members of senior management  oversees all of our hedging activity 
we may utilize a combination of fixed price forward contracts  fixed for floating price swaps and options available in the over the counter otc market 
we may also enter into futures contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex 
swaps and futures contracts allow us to protect our margins because corresponding losses or gains on the financial instruments are generally offset by gains or losses in the physical market 
we enter otc swaps with financial institutions and other energy company counterparties 
we conduct a standard credit review on counterparties and have agreements containing collateral requirements where deemed necessary 
we use standardized swap agreements that allow for offset of positive and negative exposures 
we are subject to margin deposit requirements under otc agreements with non bank counterparties and nymex positions 
the use of financial instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when i ngls do not trade at historical levels relative to crude oil  ii sales volumes are less than expected requiring market purchases to meet commitments  or iii our otc counterparties fail to purchase or deliver the contracted quantities of natural gas  ngls or crude oil or otherwise fail to perform 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  we are similarly insulated against unfavorable changes in such prices 
commodity risk management position as of december   we have entered into derivative instruments designed to manage the price risk of forecasted ngl and natural gas sales in as follows markwest hydrocarbon  inc ngl swaps ngl gallons ngl sales price per gallon markwest energy partners  lp natural gas swaps natural gas mmbtu natural gas sales price per mmbtu the ngl swaps are not designed as hedges 
as a result  changes in the fair value of the ngl swaps are reflected currently in earnings 
the natural gas swaps are designated as hedges 
as a result  changes in the fair value of the natural gas swaps are reflected in other comprehensive income  to the extent the hedges are effective  or in income currently for the ineffective portion 
interest rate risk although we had no debt outstanding with a floating interest rate at december   we would be exposed to changes in interest rates in the future if we were to draw on our credit facility or the partnership s credit facility 
we may make use of interest rate swap agreements in the future to adjust the ratio of fixed and floating rates in our debt portfolio
