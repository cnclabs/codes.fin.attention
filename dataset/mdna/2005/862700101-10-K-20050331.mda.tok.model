table of contents the company believes that its products in the food safety and water quality testing markets are unique and fill potentially large  unmet needs for rapid  easy to use analytical methods 
the company also believes that its products and technology currently being developed have broad application in diverse markets including the food and beverage and water treatment industries 
the company believes that an established product base  quality manufacturing expertise  experienced sales and marketing organization  established network of distributors  corporate partner relationships and proven research and development expertise will be critical elements of its potential future success 
accomplishments was a year during which the company made significant progress in restructuring and streamlining operations 
the company rebalanced the expense structure  improved manufacturing efficiency  and began rationalization of the product portfolio  while at the same time restructuring sales and customer service organizations to better deliver value to the customer 
all of these efforts continue to be crucial to establishing a platform for sustained growth in the company 
most recently  the company has significantly strengthened technical staff  including the hiring of two renowned scientists who will help lead the genomic antibody effort 
during this process  products have been eliminated that did not fit the company s core competencies or were unprofitable 
working with existing and prospective customers  the company has refocused resources on introducing higher value product offerings  which contribute to profitable and sustainable growth and better position sdi within the key markets currently served and targeted 
the company continues to refine its business strategy as well  clarifying strategic opportunities both near term and long term  building the company s core competencies in antibody production and antibody services  immunoassay and other rapid test platforms 
specifically  the company achieved the following significant milestones in corporate and growth initiatives food pathogens the company continues to focus on gaining broader market acceptance for both the technical and commercial benefits of its food pathogen testing technology 
sdi s food pathogen tests provide customers with actionable information  meeting or exceeding their requirements for both sensitivity and specificity 
these tests are faster  easy to interpret  point of use formatted and can dramatically lower the customers total cost in use when compared to traditional laboratory or instrument based methods 
antibody services continued expansion of our customized antibody production and solutions to existing customers while targeting new customers in the pharmaceutical  diagnostic  and research verticals within the million antibody services market 
water quality safety continue to engage with key decision makers in the food and beverage sectors to create a preventative value proposition drawing from our current base of customized rapid tests 
genetic immunization and proteomics the company has recruited two expert scientists and is investing in a new research and production facility to commercialize new technologies for high throughput production of antibodies 
this technology is specifically targeted at the rapidly developing proteomics market and the enablement of customer research  development and commercialization in the diagnostics  pharmaceutical and research markets 
environmental testing the company is expanding both its domestic and international channel partnerships to improve awareness  achieve greater distribution and increased market penetration 
richard simmonds joined the company in october as director of international distribution and sales  and is leading the company s channel partner strategy outside the us for environmental testing  expanding its ability to sell into established and emerging markets without incurring significant sales and marketing costs 

table of contents economic and industry wide factors as industry continues to look for ways to reduce costs  the company believes there will be a continual shift from testing that requires highly trained personnel  expensive equipment and lengthy turnaround times for test results  to more rapid  accurate and cost effective testing which can be performed by less highly trained personnel and completed in minutes or hours 
the global market for food pathogen testing continues to increase due to the globalization of food supply  the establishment of harmonized quality standards  the consumer s desire for fresher  more ready to eat foods and foods from diverse geographies  and increasing regulatory and media scrutiny 
the trend of increasing acceptance of gm crops and the introduction of new traits may drive additional demand for the company s products in order to maintain identity preservation and tracking 
seasonality sales levels for certain agricultural products may be impacted by seasonal demand trends 
the demand for these test kits is typically higher in the first and third quarters due to harvesting patterns 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues net revenues decreased million or in over the following table sets out revenues by product category 
year ended december  increase decrease percent change in thousands  except percentages water quality food safety antibody contract and other net revenues water and environmental products revenue decreased by to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  in the aggregate  the year over year decline relates primarily to a decrease in the number of remediation projects and correlated use of on site testing in the us alternatively  in europe  water quality revenues grew in fiscal also  contributing to the decline was pricing pressure from direct competitors and lab based testing services and the company s efforts to discontinue production and sales of low margin products  including several build to order test kits 
in december  the company was awarded a contract to supply the united nations environmental programme unep with on site testing systems for site investigations in iraq 
the  order is the first for sdi with the unep  which provides environmental expertise and guidance throughout the world 
also  in december  the company signed a distribution agreement with microbiotests  inc mbt  a european supplier of complementary test kits 
under the agreement  sdi becomes the exclusive distributor for the toxkit product lines of mbt in the united states and canada 
the product line offers our customers requiring cultural methods an alternative to expensive and labor intensive protocols  allowing users to save both time and money while maintaining quality test results 
the addition of several new toxicity models complement the company s microtox platform 

table of contents food safety products food safety revenues increased by to million for the year ended december   when compared to the prior year 
food pathogen test sales in the fourth quarter were up compared to the same quarter of and over the third quarter of  the continuation of the positive trend  which saw sales increase and for the third and second quarters of  respectively  compared to the corresponding year ago periods 
the increase was led by sales of test kits for e 
coli  salmonella and listeria  which grew by 
the company launched its listeria test kit in june  and it has become the fastest growing product in the company s food pathogen line of products 
the company s focus with all food pathogen testing products is to give the customer a lower total cost of ownership by providing the required specificity and sensitivity  while enhancing ease of use  time to result and work flow management 
since the company is a new entrant into this testing segment and holds a relatively small share of the market  and it believes its products attributes are competitive  the company expects revenues to continue to grow in this area in sales of the company s products to detect genetically modified gm traits  other than starlink  were essentially flat in when compared to the sales levels reflect the company s execution of a sizeable sale associated with new tests for soybean trait detection in the brazilian market  which has been offset by declining sales in the us due to changes in customer sampling requirements for statistical analysis which has reduced order size 
sales of the company s test kits to detect starlink were approximately million and million  in and  respectively 
we expect starlink test kit sales to continue to decrease in in october  in an effort to expand its international distribution  the company signed a new distribution agreement with genescan analytics gmbh 
under the agreement  genescan  a member of the eurofins group  will have exclusive distribution rights for the traitchek  seedchek  and feedchek product lines of the company in austria  germany  denmark  norway  switzerland  czech republic and the netherlands 
genescan will have the right to distribute the same product lines under a non exclusive agreement through the rest of europe 
genescan is the world market leader in the field of molecular biological testing for genetically modified organisms gmos in food  feed and agricultural raw materials 
genescan s pcr expertise is the industry leading method for determination of gmo content in finished food products 
antibody products antibody revenues decreased for compared to the company experienced a steep decline in revenues in the first half of that was associated with several large  one time customer projects in and  the discontinuation of low margin business 
antibody revenues increased in the fourth quarter of to million  compared to million for the same quarter in the prior year  and a increase over the third quarter of  due to an extension of a continuing improvement in business 
custom and made to order antibody services and products are at the core of sdi technology and management is encouraged by this improvement in this key business area 
included in antibody revenues for was  associated with inventories written off during other areas contract and other revenue declined as the company continued to place greater emphasis on devoting its research and development resources on internal projects  particularly in the food safety category 
operating expenses operating expenses for were million  versus million in the prior year  a decrease of that reflects the company taking a non cash charge of million in connection with the write down of certain inventories during selling  general and administrative expenses declined 
table of contents  in compared to excluding the impact of the million inventory write down in  manufacturing expenses declined million during  reflecting the benefit of the company s ongoing efforts on manufacturing process improvement and supply chain management 
gross profit defined as total revenues less manufacturing costs increased million to million during primarily due to the million non cash charge discussed above 
gross margin improved from in to in the improvement in gross margin is attributable to both the million non cash charge in and  of revenue in discussed above  and a reduction in manufacturing expenses of million during  reflecting the benefit of the company s ongoing efforts on manufacturing process improvement and supply chain management 
the company continues to aggressively move to discontinue low margin products and services  and introduce new  higher value product offerings 
research and development expenses were essentially flat at million during and reflecting the company s continuing development efforts in the food safety and water toxicity product lines 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined  in compared to included in the selling  general and administrative expenses for was a  provision for severance and related expenses associated with the company s termination of its former ceo in may and coo in late december during  the company also benefited from the recovery of a  receivable it had written off in as a result of the matters discussed above  pre tax income totaled million for the year compared to a pre tax loss of million for net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of  or negative per diluted share  in interest  net the company recorded interest income of  during compared to interest expense of  during primarily due to the lower average debt levels and higher levels of invested cash when comparing to income taxes the company s annual effective tax rate of for primarily reflects the federal statutory rate of  foreign net operating losses not previously benefited of and research and development credits of 
year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues net revenues increased million or in over the following table sets out revenues by product category 
year ended december  increase decrease percent change in thousands  except percentages water quality food safety antibody contract and other net revenues revenues for the water quality category decreased slightly in  primarily due to decreasing sales of the company s remediation and pesticide test kits  which the company believes was the result of weak general economic conditions in the national land development and construction industries 
this decrease was offset by an increase in sales of the company microtox toxicity screening systems during  with over instruments sold during  including three instruments sold into the food industry  compared to a total of instruments sold during 
table of contents food safety revenues increased in  led by sales of the company s e 
coli o testing kits 
the company entered the food pathogen testing market in early and saw a number of customers in the beef processing industry convert to the company s e 
coli o pathogen test from competitive lateral flow e 
coli tests 
also during  the company released its salmonella test  which is the most common bacteria test with respect to a wide variety of foods including meats  dairy and processed foods 
customer adoption of the company s salmonella test had been slower than expected  which the company attributes to the breadth and complexity of food matrices in this test segment and well entrenched competitive assays 
food safety sales of the company s products to detect genetically modified gm traits increased slightly in compared to  primarily driven by the company s increasing penetration into the cottonseed and brazilian soy testing markets  which was partially offset by the continued reduction in starlink test kit sales 
increased testing in the brazilian market was primarily driven by the government opening its regulations to the planting of genetically modified soy  which it had not allowed previously 
sales of the company s test kits to detect starlink were approximately million and million  in and  respectively 
in february the company released its screening test  known as feedchek  for the detection of meat and bone meal in animal feed  which is linked to the transmission of bse  commonly known as mad cow disease 
the transmission of mad cow disease is believed to be linked to the use of rendered meat and bone meal as a protein supplement in animal feed 
meat and bone meal made from cattle has been banned for use in cattle feed since in both canada and the usa  but it can be used legally in feed for poultry  swine and household pets  none of which are known to contract mad cow disease 
during  cases of mad cow had been found in the us  canada and japan 
feedchek was designed to be more sensitive and easier to use than other rapid  on site methods 
compared to certain competitive products  this test does not require weighing or boiling of samples 
by eliminating these steps  the feedchek test is faster  easier to use and does not require equipment such as scales and heating devices 
this method for animal feed has been designed with multiple tests per assay to address the various analytical requirements throughout the world 
feedchek is the only test available which provides results for both mammalian meat and bone meal and poultry meal 
poultry meal is currently prohibited from use in cattle feed in europe 
the feedchek product has been shown to detect as little as total meat and bone meal in feed 
these product features are important to comply with feed specifications and governmental regulations throughout the us  europe and japan 
the company s feedchek test participated in a comparison study performed by the joint research centre jrc of the european union 
the study findings demonstrated that the company s test had sensitivity  specificity and accuracy when analyzing for total processed animal proteins  and was the only immunoassay method to provide this level of performance 
antibody revenues increased during  primarily due to the growth of sales to existing accounts  as customers saw the strength of the production capabilities  the quality programs and project management services  which were among the improvements made when the company consolidated its production facilities in maine in contract and other revenue declined as the company continued to place greater emphasis on devoting its research and development resources on internal projects  particularly in the food safety category 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million in  due to higher manufacturing expenses  which was a result of the company taking a non cash charge of million in connection with the write down of certain inventories 
this non cash charge was the result of the company undertaking a strategic review of its operations in a manner designed to ensure the company focuses its resources on its most promising growth opportunities 
the company s evaluation included  but was not been limited to  the efficiency and effectiveness of the company s sales operations and manufacturing processes  the company s product offerings  
table of contents the company s key channels to market  the size and opportunities within the principal markets targeted by the company as well as those presented by the company s existing customer base 
the write down reflects the company s decision to exit its catalog antibody business and to focus on its custom and made to order sales of antibody products  and the elimination inventories of test kit products that are not contributing significantly to revenue or profitability 
gross profits total revenues less manufacturing costs decreased  or  to million  and gross margin declined to in from in the decline in gross margin is primarily attributable to the company taking a non cash charge of million in connection with the write down of certain inventories 
excluding the impact of the non cash charge of million in  gross profits would have increased approximately million  or  and gross margin would have increased to in from in this reflects the full year impact resulting from the consolidation of the california antibody production facility into the maine location  which was completed in  and by the company s initiatives taken in the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter to consolidate its former segments and leverage its manufacturing capacity and improve production yields 
research and development expenses decreased  primarily due to higher expenses in the prior year associated with the development efforts of the company s food pathogen and animal feed test  and continued emphasis on devoting research and development resources to internal projects rather than undertaking contract research projects for third parties 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined  in compared to  as the company took steps to reduce its overall cost structure 
included in the selling  general and administrative expenses of million for is a  provision for severance and related expenses associated with the company s termination of its former ceo in may and coo in late december interest expense  net net interest expense decreased  due to the lower average debt levels and higher levels of invested cash when comparing to income taxes income tax benefit decreased by  largely due to the smaller pre tax loss recorded in compared to the company s annual effective tax rate benefit of for primarily reflects the federal statutory rate of  state taxes  net of federal effect of and research and development credits of

the company added back the items below because management believes they are outside of our normal operations 
the company believes the inclusion of such non gaap measures helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results  consistent with how management measures the company s performance  especially when comparing such results to previous periods  including when the company had a net loss of

currently our liquidity needs arise primarily from debt service on indebtedness  working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
the following is a summary of selected cash flow information year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect on exchange rate changes on cash net increase in cash and cash equivalents the net cash provided by operating activities of million for was primarily the result of the earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the period of million 
see non gaap financial measures below 
the net cash provided by operating activities of million for was primarily the result of the million decline in inventory  resulting from the non cash charge of million 
net cash used in investing activities of  for was driven by the net capital expenditures for the period of  and  for the purchase of a technology license 
this compares to net cash used in investing activities of  which was driven by the capital expenditures for the period 
the capital expenditures for and primarily related to upgrading office infrastructure and investments in manufacturing equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities of  for and  for  was primarily driven by proceeds from the exercise of stock options  which was partially offset by net repayments of outstanding debt 
the company s working capital  current assets less current liabilities  increased million to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to the increase of million in cash and cash equivalents generated during the period 
outstanding debt decreased  from million at december  to million on december   due to scheduled repayments 
on may   the company entered into a financing agreement with a commercial bank 
this agreement provides for a  term loan  all of which had been paid on or before december   and for up to a  revolving line of credit  none of which was outstanding and approximately  of which was available at december   based on eligible assets 

table of contents the revolving line of credit bears a variable interest rate of between and over libor depending upon the ratio of the company s funded debt to ebitda  and is subject to a borrowing base determined by the company s eligible accounts receivable 
the company s annual effective rate of interest on this line of credit  taking into account the variable interest rate and libor  was approximately at december  on december   the company entered into an agreement with a commercial bank to finance the construction of new facilities at its windham  maine location 
this agreement provides for up to  in financing   of which was outstanding at december   and is repayable over seven years  with principal payments that began on october  the loan bears a variable interest rate of between and over libor depending upon the ratio of the company s funded debt to ebitda 
payments are due monthly  with equal amortization of principal payments plus interest 
the company s annual effective rate of interest on this loan at december   was approximately 
under the terms of the above financing  the company was required to meet certain quarterly financial covenants that included  for the first three quarters of  a minimum quick ratio of and a minimum tangible net worth of  which the company met 
beginning with the fourth quarter of  the original provisions of the loan agreement regarding financial covenants were operative  namely a ratio of ebitda to current maturities of debt plus interest and cash paid for taxes greater than and a ratio of funded debt to ebitda not to exceed 
the company was not in compliance with these fourth quarter covenants at december  in february  the company amended the terms of the ebitda covenants with the lender to exclude the impact of up to  of charges the company incurred in the fourth quarter  and therefore  the company met the covenant requirements for the fourth quarter under the amended covenant  the company met all of its financial covenants with respect to this indebtedness for for the year ended december   the company satisfied all of its cash requirements from the net cash provided by operating activities  cash available and on hand and from the financing agreements described above 
at december   the company had  in long term debt and stockholders equity of million 
although the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures at december   it does anticipate that it may spend approximately  in to upgrade or expand certain manufacturing  research development and office equipment and systems that will drive productivity or generate cost savings  and also to introduce automation into certain manufacturing processes that are currently labor intensive 
non gaap financial measures the company presents an ebitda measure as the company believes this provides investors and the company s management with additional information to measure the company s liquidity 
ebitda measures are not a measure of performance under gaap  and therefore should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or cash flows from operations 
additionally  the company s ebitda calculations may differ from the ebitda calculations for other companies 

table of contents the calculation of the company s ebitda measure as discussed above  and the reconciliation of the company s ebitda measure to net cash provided by operating activities for years ended december  and  respectively  is as follows amounts in thousands twelve months ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities changes in assets and liabilities receivables inventories other current assets other assets accounts payable accrued expenses net change in deferred income tax stock compensation expense interest income expense  net ebitda off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
contractual obligations the company is committed to making cash payments in the future on two types of contracts our long term indebtedness and leases 
the company has no off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations

see discussion of operating leases in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
based upon its cash on hand  credit facilities  current product sales and the anticipated sales of new products  the company believes it has  or has access to  sufficient resources to meet its operating requirements at least through january the company s ability to meet its long term capital needs will depend on a number of factors  including compliance with existing and new loan covenants  the success of its current and future products  the focus and direction of its research and development program  competitive and technological advances  future relationships with corporate partners  government regulation  the company s marketing and distribution strategy  its successful sale of additional common stock and or the company s successfully locating 
table of contents and obtaining other financing  and the success of the company s plan to make future acquisitions 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to meet the long term liquidity requirements that may arise from these inherent and similar uncertainties 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  deferred taxes  long lived assets and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the consolidated results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
valuation of accounts receivable accounts receivable as of december  and december   were net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively 
the recorded allowance is continually evaluated based on current market conditions  an analysis of customer specific facts and circumstances  and the size and composition of the overall portfolio 
if receivables become uncollectible  these write offs are charged against the allowance 
valuation of inventories inventories  which consist primarily of test kit components  bulk antibody serum and antibody products are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
realization of inventories is dependent upon the successful marketing of our products 
judgments are made regarding the carrying value of inventory based on current market conditions 
market conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions and customer demand 
if market conditions change or if the introduction of new products by the company impacts the market for previously released products  the company may be required to write down the cost of its inventory 
for example  in the company incurred a million non cash charge in connection with the write down of certain antibody inventories related to the exiting of the catalog antibody business 
deferred taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of existing temporary differences  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax items are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  at december   management has concluded that a full valuation allowance is necessary for deferred tax assets in certain state jurisdictions and for a substantial balance of foreign deferred tax assets 
revenue recognition product related revenues are composed of the sale of immunoassay based test kits and the sale of certain antibodies and immunochemical reagents 
for  and these sales represented  and of total company revenues  respectively 
the sale of immunoassay based test kits and certain antibodies and immunochemical reagents are recognized upon the shipment of the product and transfer of title or when related services are provided 

table of contents sales of certain antibodies and immunochemical reagents are recognized under the percentage of completion method and are recorded based on the percentage of costs or time incurred through the reporting date versus the estimate for the complete contract or project 
for  and these sales represented  and of total company revenues  respectively 
contract revenues are recognized upon the completion of contractual milestones 
for and these sales represented and of total company revenues  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds an asset s fair value 
new accounting standards and disclosures in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact from this standard on its results of operations and financial position 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
this statement is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have an impact on its results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r revises sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r will require compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements with limited exceptions 
the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the full impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
the company is unable to estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options
