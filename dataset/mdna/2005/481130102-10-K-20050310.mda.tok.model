at the daily newspaper  classified and retail advertising increased and we continued to record gains in our online products and solo and shared mail 
additionally  commercial printing at our community newspapers and shoppers contributed to revenue growth in operating earnings at our television stations increased  reflecting significant political advertising at our operations in milwaukee and las vegas both located in political swing states and olympics advertising at our nbc affiliates in milwaukee and palm springs 
operating earnings at our radio stations increased over last year 
our telecommunications segment continues to grow its enterprise revenue  which was up in as expected  the wholesale telecommunications business experienced continued pricing pressure and service disconnections in the year  resulting in a drop in revenue 
operating earnings decreased at our printing services company due to reduced sales volume from several computer related customers and production inefficiencies 
as we move into  we anticipate further margin expansion in our publishing segment  continued improvement in developmental markets in radio and television and tougher comparisons at our television stations due to an off cycle year in political and olympic advertising 
in our telecommunications segment  we expect ongoing declines in wholesale revenue partially offset by growth in the enterprise business

these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from several computer related customers in our printing services business and a decrease in wholesale telecommunications revenue due to customer disconnections and contract repricings 
the increase in total operating costs and expenses is due to an increase in postage and freight expense associated with mailing services revenue at our direct marketing business  an increase in newsprint expense at our publishing businesses  an increase in news and technology expenses at our television stations and a charge for voluntary terminations at our daily newspaper 
these increases were offset by the decrease in operating costs due to the revenue decrease at our printing services business  increased operating efficiencies and productivity benefits at our daily newspaper s new production facility  cost reduction initiatives at our community newspapers and shoppers business and the decrease in operating costs due to the revenue decrease at our telecommunications business 
the decrease in selling and administrative expenses is primarily due to overall cost reduction initiatives at our publishing businesses and a reduction in postretirement benefit expense in in our other segment

our consolidated ebitda in was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in we define ebitda as net earnings plus provision for income taxes  total other expense  depreciation and amortization 
we believe the presentation of ebitda is relevant and useful because it helps improve our investors ability to understand our operating performance and makes it easier to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates 
our management uses ebitda  among other things  to evaluate our operating performance and value prospective acquisitions 
in addition  our lenders use ebitda as one of the measures of our ability to service our debt 
ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for  net earnings as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda  as we calculate it  may not be comparable to ebitda measures reported by other companies

the million increase at the daily newspaper was primarily due to an increase in automotive advertising caused by certain advertisers switching their ad placement from the classified section to the retail section of the paper  taking advantage of the enhanced color capabilities of our new presses together with increases in several advertiser categories

at our daily newspaper for the march audit bureau of circulations publisher s statement  we are projecting a year over year decline in the six month average net paid circulation for sunday copies of approximately  and the six month average net paid circulation for daily copies to be essentially flat 
for the month average net paid circulation for the period ending march   we are projecting annual declines of approximately in daily copies and approximately in sunday copies as compared with the audit bureau of circulations audited figures for the prior month period 
these declines are due to changes in certain third party and single copy circulation programs and a decrease in both single copy sales and home delivery

on october   we acquired the business and certain assets of nbc affiliate wgba tv  in green bay  wisconsin and certain assets of upn affiliate wacy tv  which is licensed to serve appleton  wisconsin 
we also assumed an existing local marketing agreement between wgba tv and wacy tv

revenue from wholesale services in was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to service disconnections and lower pricing on customer contract renewals 
while we are not always able to determine the specific reason a customer may disconnect service  we believe the trend of customers focusing on reducing their network costs by consolidating traffic on least cost routes will continue 
monthly recurring revenue from wholesale services at the end of was million compared to million at the beginning of and million at the beginning of during  new circuit connections of million in monthly recurring revenue were more than offset by service disconnections and repricings 
we have substantial business relationships with a few large customers  including major long distance carriers 
our top customers  who include mci formerly worldcom inc and global crossing  accounted for and of our telecommunications revenue in and  respectively 
during  we signed a three year master capacity agreement with global crossing to provide carrier services throughout the great lakes region 
this agreement resulted in service disconnections and reduced pricing from those that had previously been in effect and a number of circuit service orders were renewed and re priced 
in february  we signed a new five year contract extension with mci whereby they remain a significant customer 
the new contract includes reduced prices for current services being provided to mci and provisions for higher capacity circuits to replace specific existing circuits being disconnected 
the effect of the pricing provisions will occur at various times throughout we believe they will remain a significant customer  though we can not predict the outcome of a potential sale or merger of mci 
when the terms of the agreements with global crossing and mci are in full effect  it is expected that neither customer will individually account for more than of our telecommunications revenue

the decrease in operating earnings from telecommunications was primarily due to the decrease in wholesale revenue  higher operating costs and expenses associated with the higher mix of enterprise revenue  and gains on the sales of towers in partially offsetting these earnings decreases were decreases in selling and promotional expenses  bad debt expense  and a lease abandonment charge in we do not believe we have a material bad debt exposure because we bill all data services for both wholesale and enterprise customers in advance of providing services 
most customers are required to pay their bill before services are provided

the decrease in printing services operating earnings was primarily attributed to the decrease in sales volume  production inefficiencies on print work  charges for workforce reductions  and a charge for some of the costs incurred for a discontinued software system implementation project

while we are not always able to determine the specific reason a customer may disconnect service  we believe the trend of customers focusing on reducing their network costs will continue  primarily due to consolidating traffic on least cost routes and economic and other changes occurring within our customers end user customer base 
monthly recurring revenue from wholesale services at the end of was million compared to million at the beginning of and million at the beginning of during  new circuit connections of million in monthly recurring revenue were more than offset by service disconnections 
mci and global crossing together accounted for and of our telecommunications revenue in and  respectively 
global crossing filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in january and emerged in december during  we signed a three year master capacity agreement with global crossing to provide carrier services throughout the great lakes region 
this agreement resulted in service disconnections and reduced pricing from those that had previously been in effect and a number of circuit service orders were renewed and re priced 
mci filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in july and emerged in april in april  we sold our mci pre petition receivable  net of applicable set off accounts payable  to a third party 
we continue to provide services to mci and receive advance or timely payment for those services 
in february  we signed a new five year contract extension with mci whereby they remain a significant customer 
the new contract includes reduced prices for current services being provided to mci and provisions for higher capacity circuits to replace existing circuits being disconnected 
we believe they will remain a significant customer  though we can not predict the outcome of a potential sale or merger of mci 
in  we continued to record monthly revenues from mci that remained at recent levels and are not wholly reflective of the coming transition to contract renewal terms 
the loss of the ongoing business from either of these two customers would have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations

monthly recurring revenue from enterprise advanced data services at the end of was million compared to million at the beginning of and recently  regulators approved sbc communications inc s application to offer long distance service in wisconsin  indiana  illinois and michigan 
we believe this increased competition for enterprise telecommunication services could adversely impact us through the loss of existing customers or by reducing the success rate of securing new customers 
the decrease in operating earnings from telecommunications was primarily attributed to wholesale service disconnections that occurred during and  a decrease in profit margin due to higher operating costs and expenses associated with the higher mix of enterprise revenue  the recording of a lease abandonment expense and an increase in depreciation expense  partially offset by gains on the sales of towers and a decrease in bad debt expense 
we do not believe we have a material bad debt exposure because we bill all data services for both wholesale and enterprise customers in advance of providing services 
most customers are required to pay their bill before services are provided 
printing services revenue from printing services in was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in operating earnings from printing services in were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in the decrease in printing services revenue was primarily attributed to the reduction in revenue from our largest customer  dell computer corporation  resulting from its decision to purchase certain products that are supplied by a different vendor and the loss of sales resulting from the consolidation of assembly and fulfillment operations into michigan during these decreases have been offset by an increase in publication printing revenue 
the increase in printing services operating earnings was primarily attributed to a reduction in operational costs due to the decrease in revenue  the closure of our cd rom mastering and replication operations and cost reduction initiatives

some of the lease agreements contain renewal options and rental escalation clauses  as well as provisions for the payment of utilities  maintenance and taxes by us

table of contents critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related footnote disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  property and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  litigation  and pension and other postretirement benefits 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us such as bankruptcy filings  credit history  etc  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due us to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past loss history  the length of time the receivables are past due and the current business environment 
if our evaluations of the collectibility of our accounts receivable differ from actual results  increases or decreases in bad debt expense and allowances may be required 
property and equipment we assign useful lives for our property and equipment based on our estimate of the amount of time that we will use those assets and we have selected the straight line method to depreciate the majority of the property and equipment 
a change in the estimated useful lives or the depreciation method used could have a material impact upon our results of operations 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
accounting standards require that  if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from a company s assets  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the estimated future cash flows related to an asset or group of assets is highly susceptible to change because we must make assumptions about future revenue and the related cost of sales 
changes in our assumptions could require us to recognize a loss for asset impairment 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill and broadcast licenses account for and of total assets in and  respectively 
the annual impairment tests for goodwill and broadcast licenses under statement no 
require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by factors including competitive industry valuations and long term interest rates that exist at the time the annual impairment tests are performed 
accordingly  we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under statement no 
to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  and to the extent that market values and long term interest rates in general decrease and increase  respectively 

table of contents accrued income taxes the internal revenue service and various state departments of revenue routinely examine our federal and state tax returns 
from time to time  the irs and the state departments of revenue may challenge certain of our tax positions 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged 
the final disposition of any positions challenged by the irs or state departments of revenue could require us to make additional tax payments or have an impact on our effective tax rate 
nonetheless  we believe that we have adequately reserved for any foreseeable payments related to such matters and consequently do not anticipate any material earnings impact from the ultimate resolution of such matters 
accrued litigation we are subject to various legal actions  administrative proceedings and claims 
when necessary  we may need to record a liability for an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of such claims 
the estimate would be developed in consultation with counsel and would be based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we believe that such unresolved legal actions and claims would not materially affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
employee benefits we are self insured for a majority of our employee related health and disability benefits and workers compensation claims 
a third party administrator is used to process all claims 
liabilities for unpaid claims are based on our historical claims experience 
liabilities for workers compensation claims are developed from actuarial valuations 
actual amounts could vary significantly from such estimates which would require us to record additional expense in the future 
we rely upon actuarial valuations to determine pension costs and funding 
we provide the actuarial firms with certain assumptions that have a significant effect on our obligations  such as the discount rate used to arrive at the net present value of the obligations and expense  the return on assets used to estimate the growth in invested asset value available to satisfy certain obligations  the salary increases used to calculate the impact future pay increases will have on postretirement obligations  and the employee turnover statistics used to estimate the number of employees to be paid postretirement benefits 
the weighted average assumptions used in accounting for pension benefits and other postretirement benefits for and are pension benefits other postretirement benefits discount rate for expense discount rate for obligations rate of compensation increases expected return on plan assets for our pension plans  a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would have lowered by million or raised by million  respectively  the plans expense and would have lowered the plans projected benefit obligations by million or raised by million  respectively  as of december  moody s aa corporate bonds  as of the measurement date  is a benchmark we use to determine the assumed discount rate 
in  we studied our plan specific discount rate by matching our projected benefit payments to a 
table of contents yield curve developed from high grade corporate bonds 
it was determined that this rate along with the moody s aa corporate bond rate supported our discount rate assumption of 
we make other assumptions that affect the accounting for pension benefits  such as the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increase 
changes in these assumptions affect the benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the pension plan and the other postretirement plan and the required funding of the pension plan 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis 
we also rely upon actuarial valuations to determine postretirement benefit costs other than pension 
we provide the actuarial firms with the assumption of the discount rate and medical cost inflation 
these assumptions could have a significant effect on our obligation 
the discount rate is used to arrive at the net present value of the obligation 
the health care cost trend rate is used to calculate the impact future medical costs would have on postretirement obligations

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
statement no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
statement no 
r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  we will adopt statement no 
r in the third quarter of fiscal under statement no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of statement r  while the retroactive method would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of statement no 
r and have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting statement r  including whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under statement no 
we do not believe the effect of adopting statement no 
r will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

in the first quarter of 
table of contents we do not believe the effect of adopting statement no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effect of inflation our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by general inflation 
we have reduced the effects of rising costs through improvements in productivity  cost containment programs and  where the competitive environment permits  increased selling prices 
however  changes in newsprint prices could have an impact on costs  which we may not be able to offset fully in our pricing or cost containment programs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates on our long term notes payable to banks  which are borrowings under our million unsecured revolving credit facility  and in prices for newsprint 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flows 
interest rates on our long term notes payable to banks are variable 
the interest rate on the current unsecured revolving credit facility is either at libor plus a margin that ranges from basis points to basis points  or the base rate  which equals the higher of the prime rate set by us bank  us or the federal funds rate plus one percent per annum 
average interest rates on borrowings under our credit facility were in if interest rates had been basis points higher  our annual interest expense would have increased million  assuming comparable borrowing levels 
we have not entered into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
we currently purchase approximately of our estimated newsprint requirements from two suppliers 
we pay market prices for quantities we determine will meet our requirements 
the remaining of our newsprint could come from these suppliers or from other suppliers in the spot market 
price fluctuations for newsprint can have a significant effect on our results of operations 
the average net price per ton was in based on the average net price per ton in and consumption of newsprint in  a per ton increase or decrease in the price of newsprint would increase or decrease our total cost of newsprint by million 
we have not entered into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to newsprint price risk
