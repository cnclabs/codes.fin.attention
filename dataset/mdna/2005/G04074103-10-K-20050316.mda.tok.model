overview during  we completed two share offerings resulting in net proceeds of approximately million  after commissions and fees 
in march and april of we completed the issuance of million principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due and in october and december of we completed the issuance of an additional million principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due the convertible notes offerings resulted in aggregate net proceeds of million after commissions 
the net proceeds from the share offerings and the convertible notes will be used to finance a portion of the construction and development of our san crist bal project  advance evaluation of exploration properties and for other general corporate purposes 
we continue to work with barclays and bnp paribas to secure commercial bank debt financing and develop other financing options for san crist bal as part of a total financing package that may incorporate support from export credit agencies  multilateral agencies and other public lenders 
during  we also filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission 
the registration statement became effective in august  and allows us to sell up to million in any combination of equity or debt securities as described in the registration statement in one or more offerings 
we have completed updating the san crist bal development plan  and in october we released an updated estimate of capital costs 
the capital cost estimate is approximately million  million or more than estimated in the updated feasibility study 
the increase in the estimated capital cost was due to changes in the infrastructure scope including the decision to haul concentrates by rail rather than by truck  higher energy and raw material costs and other normal cost escalations 
the capital cost estimate includes pre stripping  engineering  procurement  construction  and freight necessary to commence production  as well as appropriate taxes  duties and levies under bolivian law 
the estimate excludes working capital  advances to the companies constructing the power line and port  escalation from the original constant dollar estimate and certain production enhancements which were added subsequent to the october estimate 
total project funding from january  going forward  including all additional amounts described above that were not included in the october estimate  is approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million in capital costs were spent at the san crist bal project during and approximately million of the costs relate to amounts that may be paid using ordinary shares rather than cash

 where employee stock based compensation cost was recognized from january  as if the fair value based accounting method in fas no 
had been used to account for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled in fiscal years beginning after december  as a result  compensation costs of million were recognized including million capitalized and million charged to expense for the year ended december  the costs include a charge of approximately million relating to the modification of stock awards previously granted to the retiring apex silver chairman  another retiring director and a retiring employee

administrative costs during also increased as the result of the addition of personnel and the related support costs in anticipation of the development of our san crist bal project 
the decrease in administrative expenses from million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period of is primarily the result of cost savings associated with the reduction of personnel and office facilities as part of a cash conservation policy that was in effect during that period 
interest and other income 
our interest and other income for the year ended december  was million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase is the result of interest earned on the higher cash balances we held as a result of the ordinary share and convertible debt offerings completed during the decrease in interest and other income for the year ended december  compared to the same period of is primarily the result of lower interest rates during gains and losses commodity derivatives

the san crist bal property lease payments are all related to payments the company must make to the bolivian government to maintain its rights to the san crist bal mining concessions 
the purchase obligations are all related to orders placed for long lead time equipment being purchased for the san crist bal project 
from time to time we enter into lease option agreements related to exploration properties that are of interest to us 
these agreements normally contain escalating lease payments required to maintain our exploration rights to the property 
such agreements are not included in the above table because exploration success is historically low and the agreements can be terminated by us at any time 
environmental compliance our current and future exploration and development activities  as well as our future mining and processing operations  are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we conduct our activities 
these laws and regulations govern the protection of the environment  prospecting  development  production  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  mine safety  toxic substances and other matters 
we expect to be able to comply with those laws and do not believe that compliance will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
we intend to obtain all licenses and permits required by all applicable regulatory agencies in connection with our mining operations and exploration activities 
we intend to maintain standards of environmental compliance consistent with regulatory requirements 
critical accounting policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have changed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
you should also read note of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements are affected by estimates that we  or experts that we have retained  have made as to our proven and probable reserves 
reserve estimates involve subjective judgment and are based on numerous assumptions that may later prove to be inaccurate 
these estimates include engineering evaluations of assay values derived from samplings of drill holes and other openings 
additionally  changes in the market prices of metals may render certain reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to mine 
further  availability of permits  changes in operating and capital costs  and other factors could materially and adversely affect ore reserves 
our current proven and probable reserve estimates at san crist bal total approximately million tonnes of ore grading grams per tonne silver  zinc and lead  containing approximately million ounces of silver  billion pounds of zinc and billion pounds of lead 
the reserves are based on per ounce silver  per pound zinc and per pound lead 
these prices represent the three year average prices for each of the metals as per guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission 
to complete the project financing on san crist bal  we may be required to hedge a portion of our planned production 
in addition  when san crist bal enters production  we may sell forward a portion of our production and use price hedging techniques to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuating metals prices 
we currently engage in limited metals trading activities utilizing puts and calls and other market instruments in anticipation of potential lender requirements for the san crist bal project financing 
we measure the fair value of open positions at each reporting period and record the difference in the carrying value to current earnings  in accordance with fas under fas  fair value measurements may vary substantially from period to period based on spot prices  forward prices and quoted option volatilities 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currently  our major principal cash balances are held in us dollars 
we maintain minimum cash balances in foreign currencies and therefore have a relative low exposure to currency fluctuations 
during we placed an order for certain long lead equipment related to the san crist bal project 
the purchase price of the equipment was denominated in euros 
to partially offset the potential deterioration of the us dollar relative to the euro  we entered into a foreign currency collar transaction utilizing puts and calls 
for the year ended december  we recognized a gain related to the transaction of approximately million based on the fair market value of the puts and calls at that date 
because we conduct our activities in several foreign countries  we may in the future engage in additional hedging activities to minimize the risk of exposure to currency and interest rate fluctuations 
to complete the project financing for san crist bal  we expect to be required to hedge a portion of our planned production 
in addition  when san crist bal enters production  we may sell forward a portion of our production and use price hedging techniques to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuating metals prices 
we currently engage in limited metals trading activities  utilizing puts and calls and other market instruments in anticipation of potential lender requirements for the san crist bal project financing 
we recorded a trading gain for the year ended december  of approximately million 
from our inception until december   we have recorded a gain of approximately million related to the metals trading program 
this amount represents approximately million of cash gains partially offset by million of unrealized losses at december  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations
