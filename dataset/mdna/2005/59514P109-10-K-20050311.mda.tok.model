item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussions of research and development expenses 
sales and marketing as of december   our worldwide sales organization consisted of over employees with offices located throughout the us plano  tx  huntsville  al  atlanta  ga  chicago  il  campbell  ca  san diego  ca  and raleigh  nc  and in regional centers around the world ingolstadt  germany  taipei  taiwan  tokyo  japan and seoul  south korea 
our sales organization consists of technical sales  service and customer support professionals and includes a field application engineering staff that is involved with customers during various phases of design and production 
the field applications engineering function  located throughout our worldwide sales offices  is a critical element in achieving customer design wins 
we also support customers with application engineering from our plano and ingolstadt technical personnel 

table of contents we centralize and manage sales for all of our products across each of our target markets under one worldwide sales organization 
we sell our products directly to our customers and via a network of distributors and independent sales representatives located around the world 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of financial information by geographic area 
backlog our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products 
due to industry practice that allows customers to cancel or change orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment  we do not believe that backlog is a reliable indicator of future revenue levels 
customers we market and sell our ics and subsystem module solutions directly to oems and original design manufacturers odms of cable  communications  consumer electronics  pc multimedia and transportation electronics products  to third party electronic manufacturing service providers  and to distributors 
we engage with customers at multiple levels within their organization  provide design and systems services  provide applications engineering support  and align product roadmaps to meet their product requirements 
we supplied our ic and module and micromodule products to more than customers worldwide during the year ended december   including the following consumer electronics broadband communications arris  askey  asustek computer  cisco  echostar  hauppauge  hitron  motorola  pace  pinnacle  samsung  scientific atlanta  tellabs and terayon 
transportation electronics panasonic  delphi fuba automotive  harman becker automotive  and rockwell collins 
sales to scientific atlanta and asustek computer for the benefit of arris and terayon accounted for approximately and  respectively  of consolidated net revenue for manufacturing we use subcontractors for ic wafer production  die packaging and testing 
this allows us to eliminate the high capital requirements of owning and operating semiconductor fabrication  packaging and test facilities 
it also enables us to focus on the design of our ic products as well as providing engineering to support our customers  where we believe we have the best opportunity to create and maintain competitive advantage 
we have established relations with ic wafer foundries  ibm microelectronics and x fab  to help ensure our future demands are in line with their manufacturing technology roadmaps and capacities 
these foundries offer a mature bicmos production process 
in addition  ibm offers advanced silicon germanium sige process technology 
we are currently in process of qualifying a second source for sige process technology 
we use amkor in korea and in the philippines and ase korea for ic packaging and final test 
we use bridgepoint technical manufacturing in austin  tx for wafer probe and in penrose  co for tape and reel packaging 
we also use ise in austin  tx for wafer probe 
bridgepoint is currently in bankruptcy proceedings 
see item  factors affecting future operating results and stock price 
we also perform rf testing at our facility in plano  tx 
we closed our manufacturing facility in the philippines during  where we built almost all our rf module and micromodule subsystem solutions  and sold most of the facility s manufacturing equipment and raw 
table of contents material inventories to three five systems  inc tfs 
simultaneously  we agreed to subcontract the majority our rf module and micromodule subsystem manufacturing to tfs 
in january  tfs informed us that it wishes to sell its philippines facility in which our products are manufactured 
if tfs is unable to sell the facility  we may experience a disruption in our supply of product 
see item  factors affecting future operating results and stock price 
we use katek in germany to build a small portion of our rf module and micromodule products 
competition the semiconductor industry  in general  and the markets in which we compete  in particular  are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and price erosion 
many of our competitors are larger  diversified companies with substantially greater financial resources 
some of our competitors are also customers who have internal ic and rf subsystems design and manufacturing capability 
we also compete with smaller  emerging companies whose strategy is to sell products into specialized markets or to provide a portion of the products or product capabilities that we offer 
we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter our markets 
although the specific basis on which we compete varies by market  we believe that the principal factors common to all our markets are conformity to industry standards  performance improvements  price reductions  differentiating product features  time to market for new products  quality and reliability  application engineering support  and adaptability and flexibility to meet customers and target markets requirements 
consumer electronics broadband communications our major rf tuner competitors in the consumer electronics broadband communications market include alps  anadigics  analog devices  broadcom  freescale  maxim  panasonic  philips electronics  rf magic  thomson  xceive and  potentially  companies such as stmicroelectronics 
broadcom and philips  in particular  are shipping a silicon tuner that competes with our tuner products in certain consumer electronic broadband communication markets 
other companies have announced silicon tuners  but we believe their products are not yet in production or their production status is unknown to us  including integrant  sirenza  lsi logic  sige semiconductor  sony and zarlink 
transportation electronics tuner competitors in the transportation electronics market include alps  mitsumi  panasonic  philips  sanshin  and siemens vdo 
environmental matters international  federal  state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment  the disposal of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the environment may have an impact on our operations 
we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and 
table of contents regulations 
to date  compliance with environmental requirements and resolution of environmental claims have been accomplished without material effect on our liquidity or capital resources 
employees as of december   we had a total of employees worldwide  including in research and development  in sales and marketing and in operations  finance and administration 
of these employees  were located in the united states 
item properties our principal offices and corporate headquarters are located in plano  tx 
our plano facilities consist of approximately  square feet 
we are in the process of extending our lease  which currently expires during the design center for our transportation business is in ingolstadt  germany  where we lease approximately  square feet 
the ingolstadt lease will expire in we also have sales and technical support offices in huntsville  al  campbell  ca  san diego  ca  atlanta  ga  chicago  il  raleigh  nc  tokyo  japan  taipei  taiwan and seoul  south korea 
we believe our facilities are adequate for our current and near term needs and that we will be able to locate additional facilities as needed 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information about our lease commitments 
item legal proceedings from time to time  we may be involved in routine legal proceedings  as well as demands  claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business 
the ultimate amount of liability  if any  for any pending claims of any type either alone or combined may materially and adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
moreover  the ultimate outcome of any pending litigation is uncertain 
any outcome  whether favorable or unfavorable  may materially and adversely affect us due to legal costs and expenses  diversion of management resources and other factors 
there can be no assurance that additional contingencies of a legal nature or contingencies having legal aspects will not be asserted in the future 
such matters could relate to prior transactions or events or future transactions or events

securities litigation initial public offering litigation starting on july   multiple purported securities fraud class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
we are aware of at least three such complaints berger v 
goldman  sachs co  inc et al  atlas v 
microtune et al  and ellis investments ltd 
v 
goldman  sachs co  inc et al 
the complaints are brought purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased our common stock from august  through december  and are related to in re initial public offering securities litigation ipo cases 
the atlas complaint names as defendants microtune  douglas j 
bartek  our former chairman and chief executive officer  everett rogers  our former chief financial officer and vice president of finance and administration  and several investment banking firms that served as underwriters of our initial public offering 
microtune  mr 
bartek and mr 
rogers were served with notice of the atlas complaint on august   however  they have not been served regarding the other referenced complaints 
the berger and ellis investment ltd 
complaints assert claims against the underwriters only 
the complaints were consolidated and amended on may  the amended complaint alleges liability under and of the securities act of act claims and b and a of the securities exchange act of act claims  on the grounds that the registration statement for our initial public offering did not disclose that the underwriters had agreed to allow certain of their customers to purchase shares in the 
table of contents offering in exchange for excess commissions paid to the underwriters  and the underwriters had arranged for certain of their customers to purchase additional shares in the aftermarket at pre determined prices 
the amended complaint also alleges that false analyst reports were issued 
no specific amount of damages is claimed 
we are aware that similar allegations have been made in other lawsuits filed in the southern district of new york challenging over other initial public offerings and secondary offerings conducted in  and those cases have been consolidated for pretrial purposes before the honorable shira a 
scheindlin 
on february   the court ruled on all defendants motions to dismiss 
the court denied the motions to dismiss the act claims 
the court did not dismiss the act claims against us and other issuers and underwriters 
we have accepted a settlement proposal presented to all issuer defendants 
under the settlement  plaintiffs will dismiss and release all claims against the microtune defendants 
the insurance companies collectively responsible for insuring the issuer defendants in all of the ipo cases will guarantee plaintiffs a recovery of billion  an amount that covers all of the ipo cases 
under this guarantee  the insurers will pay the difference  if any  between billion and the amount collected by the plaintiffs from the underwriter defendants in all of the ipo cases 
the microtune defendants will not be required to pay any money in the settlement 
however  any payment made by the insurers will be charged to the respective insurance policies covering each issuer s case on a pro rata basis that is  the total insurance company payments will be divided by the number of cases that settle 
if the pro rata charge exceeds the amount of insurance coverage for an issuer  that issuer would be responsible for additional payments 
the proposal also provides that the insurers will pay for the company s legal fees going forward 
the settlement will require approval of the court  which cannot be assured

the following table shows the range of high and low sale prices reported on the pink sheets from july  through april  and the nasdaq stock market from april  until december  on february   the closing price of our common stock was as quoted on the nasdaq national market 
year ended december  high low high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter we were delisted from the nasdaq national market effective july  and were relisted for trading on the nasdaq national market effective april  we believe factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  announcements by us  our competitors  or our customers  technological innovations  new product introductions  governmental regulations  litigation or changes in earnings estimates by analysts may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
in addition  the stock prices of many technology companies fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results

this section should also be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item overview we design and market radio frequency rf silicon and subsystem module solutions for the worldwide consumer electronics broadband communications and transportation electronics markets 
within these markets  our products permit the delivery  reception  and exchange of broadband video  audio and data in terrestrial and cable communications systems 
the consumer electronics broadband communications market is intensely competitive and the market historically has seen rapid changes in demand 
we may not be able to fully capitalize on increasing demand as we do not own production facilities and must compete for production capacity 
we could be impacted more negatively than some of our competitors during times of decreasing demand because we may not be the primary supplier to some of our customers 
this market is also characterized as having short product life cycles  due to rapid technological changes  resulting in rapidly decreasing average selling prices  making yield improvements and decreasing production costs for maturing products critical 
the volatility of the consumer electronics broadband communications market makes it difficult for us to discuss business trends or to predict future results 
since inception we have incurred significant losses resulting in an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  our operating history and our business risks  including those risks set forth under the caption factors affecting future operating results and stock price in item and under the caption quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  in item a  make the prediction of future results of operations difficult 
as a result  there can be no assurances that we will achieve or sustain revenue growth or profitability 
we have invested heavily in research and development of our rf integrated circuits and subsystem module technology 
we expect to continue our investment in these areas to further develop our rf products 
this investment may include the continued recruitment of rf and analog integrated circuit designers and systems engineers  and the acquisition of test and development equipment and software development tools for the expansion of our product lines 
as a result  we may continue to incur substantial losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will result in the timely development and commercial release of products that achieve market acceptance 
the time lag between product availability and volume shipment can be significant due to the sales process for our products  including customer qualification of our products 
this delay can be from six months to as long as four years  during which we continue to develop our technology 
we use ibm and x fab to manufacture our wafers  and amkor and ase to assemble our integrated circuits 
we perform final testing and shipping of our integrated circuits at our facility in plano  tx 
we also perform final testing  packaging and shipping of our integrated circuits overseas at amkor and ase 
we use bridgepoint technical manufacturing  which is in bankruptcy proceedings  in austin  tx and penrose  co for wafer probe  tape and reel packaging and shipping for our integrated circuits 
we also use ise in austin  tx for wafer probe 
we use tfs and katek for assembly and calibration functions for our subsystem module solutions 
see item  manufacturing agreement with three five systems  inc testing of our automotive tuner modules is also performed at a facility in huntsville  al and at amb electric in vohburg  germany 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
note to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies essential to our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our financial statements requires estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions which we have used are appropriate and correct based upon information available to us at the time that they were made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect our reported assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenue and expense during the periods presented 
if there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual facts  our financial statements may be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require our judgment in its application 
there are areas in which our judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result  but there are some areas in which our judgment in selecting among available alternatives would produce a materially different result 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements that contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies 
that is  they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and they require significant estimates  judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when we receive a purchase order from our customer  our product has been shipped  title has transferred to our customer  the price that we will receive for our product is fixed or determinable  and collection from our customer is considered probable 
title to our product transfers to our customer either when it is shipped to or received by our customer  based on the customer s specific agreement 
our revenue is recorded based on the facts currently known to us 
if we do not meet all the criteria above  we do not recognize revenue 
if we are unable to determine the amount that we will ultimately collect once our product has shipped and title has transferred to our customer  we defer recognition of revenue until we can determine the amount that ultimately will be collected 
items that are considered when determining the amounts we will ultimately collect are a customer s overall credit worthiness and payment history  customer rights to return unsold product  customer rights to price protection  customer payment terms conditional on sale or use of product by the customer  or other extended payment terms granted to a customer 
it is not our standard business practice to grant any of these terms to our customers 
for certain of our customers  we do not recognize revenue until receipt of payment because collection is not probable or the amount we will ultimately collect is not determinable at the date of the shipment 
upon shipment of product to these customers  title to the inventory transfers to the customer and the customer is invoiced 
we account for these transactions by recording accounts receivable for the sales value of the shipments  as the shipments represent valid receivables  and reducing inventory for the cost of the inventory shipped 
the difference  representing the gross margin on the transactions  is recorded as deferred revenue 
for financial statement presentation purposes  this deferred revenue balance is offset against the corresponding accounts receivable balance from the customer 
when payment is received for the transaction  revenue is recognized for the value of the cash payment  cost of sales is recorded for the cost of the inventory and the deferred revenue is relieved for the gross margin on the transaction 
at december  and  the sales value of products shipped for which revenue was deferred was approximately million and million  respectively 
all of the sales value related to revenue deferred at december  was recognized during 
table of contents when we defer revenue  the timing and amount of revenue we ultimately recognize is determined upon our receipt of payment  which can result in significant fluctuations in revenues from period to period 
in and  we recognized and of our net revenue upon receipt of payment  respectively 
we also defer revenue when customers have made payments and we have not completed the earnings process 
these payments are reflected as liabilities in our financial statements as deferred revenue 
in these instances  once the product is shipped and title has transferred to our customer  we recognize revenue 
deferred revenue as a result of customer prepayments was insignificant as of december  as of december   we had deferred revenue as a result of customer prepayments of million 
during  we recognized approximately million in royalty revenue related to third party purchases of a competitor s product that was found to infringe one of our patents and sales by the competitor of their infringing product in accordance with the patent settlement agreement signed in june we grant limited stock rotation rights for conforming product to certain distributors for up to of their aggregate net purchases for the previous six months 
in these circumstances  we require the distributor to submit an offsetting purchase order that is  at a minimum  equivalent to the aggregate dollar amount of the product to be returned 
we account for the return as a reduction to revenue and a reduction to accounts receivable for the price of the items returned 
correspondingly  cost of sales is reduced by the cost of returned inventory offset by an increase in inventory 
any returned inventory items are included in gross inventories  are reviewed along with our other inventory items and are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
historically  distributor returns under stock rotation rights have been insignificant 
as a result  we do not establish a reserve for potential returns when product is shipped to distributors 
we account for the shipment of replacement product as a sales transaction  which offsets the reduction of revenue discussed above 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance for bad debts against amounts due to us and reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are outstanding compared to contractual terms  industry and geographic concentrations  the current business environment and our historical experience 
accounts receivable included in the allowance of doubtful accounts are written off after final collection efforts are exhausted 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  increases in the allowance may be required in the future 
we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  and there can be no assurance that our allowance will be adequate 
if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the allowance we have established  our general and administrative expenses would increase and our reported net income would decrease 
conversely  if our actual credit losses are significantly less than our allowance  our general and administrative expenses would eventually decrease and our reported net income would eventually increase 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost  or estimated realizable value 
adjustments to reduce our inventories to estimated realizable value  including allowances for excess and obsolete inventories  are determined quarterly by comparing inventory levels of individual materials and parts to current backlog and estimated future sales 
actual amounts realized upon the sale of inventories may differ from estimates used to determine inventory valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand  technology changes and other factors 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the recoverability of these assets by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to projected undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets or business center 
if we determine our long lived assets are impaired  we recognize the impairment in the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
deferred taxes our income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method of accounting 
under the asset and liability method  a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
the measurement of deferred income tax assets is adjusted by a valuation allowance  if necessary  to recognize future tax benefit only to the extent  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not such benefits will be realized 
our deferred tax assets were fully reserved at december  for us federal income tax purposes  at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  including operating loss carryforwards of transilica and an unused research and development credit carryforward of approximately million which will begin to expire in our deferred tax assets have been fully reserved due to the uncertainty of our ability to utilize them 
if we generate us taxable income in future periods  reversal of this valuation allowance could have a significant positive impact on net income in the period that it becomes more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be utilized 
a change in ownership  as defined in section of the internal revenue code  may limit utilization of the us federal net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies for various legal matters 
our discussion of legal matters includes pending litigation and matters in which any party has manifested a present intention to commence litigation related to such matters 
there can be no assurance that additional contingencies of a legal nature or having legal aspects will not be asserted in the future 
such matters could relate to prior transactions or events or future transactions and events 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether any provisions for loss should be made 
if we ultimately determine that a provision for loss should be made for a legal matter  the provision for loss could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
our future cash commitments are primarily for long term facility leases 
our lease in germany for our administrative  sales and marketing and research and development facility has an option to purchase the facility during certain time periods during the lease 
the lease has a twenty two year term  which began in december financial information restatements of financial statements in february our audit committee  under the direction of our board of directors  retained john m 
fedders  a former director of the division of enforcement of the sec  as independent counsel to inquire into the events related to significant negative adjustments to preliminarily recorded revenue for products that we shipped in the third and fourth quarter of the inquiry was subsequently expanded to cover all of and  and concluded in july 
table of contents as a result of the inquiry s findings  our board determined to restate our previously reported financial results for and our quarters ended september   december   march   june  and september  the aggregate annual effect of the restatements on our revenue was to decrease our revenue by  from million to million 
the aggregate effect of the restatements on our previously reported financial results for the first nine months of was to decrease revenue by  from million to million 
the restatements increased our previously reported net loss by  from million to million and our previously reported net loss for the first nine months of by  from million to million 
also as a result of the restatements  as of september   we deferred the recognition of approximately million of revenue related to transactions that had been previously incorrectly reported as revenue 
of this million  million  million  million  and million was recognized as revenue in the fourth quarter of  the first quarter of  the second quarter of and the third quarter of  respectively 
manufacturing agreement with three five systems  inc on march   we executed a five year manufacturing agreement with three five systems tfs  a worldwide supplier of engineering and manufacturing services 
the significant terms of the agreement are tfs will manufacture  assemble and test our rf module and micromodule subsystems in its manufacturing facility in manila  philippines  tfs purchased most of the manufacturing equipment and raw materials inventory from our former philippines facility  tfs agreed to manage our former philippines manufacturing facility as manufacturing was transferred to tfs facility  we agreed that tfs could  under certain circumstances  require us to repurchase raw material inventories  and we agreed on pricing terms for our then current products  future price reductions for such products  and a pricing formula for our future products  taking into account our volume of activity with tfs and tfs costs of material  labor and overhead 
as part of the agreement  we sold tfs most of the equipment and most of the raw materials inventories of our philippines manufacturing facility for approximately million  net of a million fee for managing our former facility 
proceeds consisted of million in cash  and a note receivable of million 
the total sales price of the equipment sold was approximately million which approximated its net book value 
we initially sold inventory to tfs at its carrying value of million however  under the terms of the agreement  tfs could require us  days after execution of the agreement  to repurchase the raw materials inventory  if excess quantities existed because tfs was unable to utilize the materials in fulfilling our existing or forecasted orders 
additionally  days from the execution of the agreement  tfs  at its sole discretion  could require us to repurchase any raw materials that had not been consumed in fulfilling our orders 
our maximum obligation to repurchase raw materials inventory under this agreement was approximately million 
during the third quarter of  we agreed to repurchase a portion of the million of raw material inventories from tfs valued at million 
the million inventory repurchase was charged to cost of revenue as excess inventory 
the raw material repurchase was offset against the million note receivable and we collected million in cash for the remaining balance of the note receivable in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we made an additional provision of million for inventory repurchases from tfs which was also charged to cost of revenue 
during  we purchased million of inventories from tfs that became excess as a result of our canceling purchase orders placed with tfs 
as a result of the sale of assets to tfs in  we reduced our payroll by approximately  employees and recorded restructuring costs totaling million in the first quarter of including million for 
table of contents employee severance and benefits  million for settlement of our lease obligations  million for restructuring charges and million for the loss on the disposal of the assets 
in january  tfs informed us that it wishes to sell its philippines facility in which our products are manufactured 
if tfs is unable to sell the facility  we may experience a disruption in our supply of product as manufacturing in transitioned to a new facility or subcontractor

we discontinued all wireless development as of december  and closed our microtune san diego design center 
the closure resulted in a restructuring charge of million 

table of contents impairment of goodwill during the third quarter of  our market capitalization declined to a level that was below our net book value 
we believed this was partially due to our normal seasonal revenue trends for sales to our automobile manufactures and their suppliers and to a negative impact to sales by a competitor whose products were subsequently found to willfully infringe on one of our patents 
at the end of the third quarter of  we did not believe that either of these trends was indicative of an impairment of our goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of  our market capitalization continued at a level significantly less than our net book value and we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our net assets  including goodwill  was less than their carrying values 
we performed an impairment analysis and concluded that our goodwill was fully impaired

future operating commitments lease commitments in the normal course of business  we may enter into leases for new or expanded facilities in both domestic and foreign locations

we may decide to use cash and cash equivalents and short term investments to fund such activities in the future 
our future cash commitments are primarily for long term facility leases 
future minimum lease payments required under operating leases as of december  are as follows in thousands year ending december  thereafter purchase commitments as of february   we had approximately million of cancelable and non cancelable purchase commitments outstanding with our vendors 
these commitments were entered into in the normal course of business and include a multi year licensing agreement for engineering design software totaling million entered into on december  the software was not received until early payment for the license fees was made in the first quarter of other commitments we are currently subject to line down clauses in some contracts with our customers 
such clauses require us to pay financial penalties if our failure to supply product in a timely manner causes the customer to slow down or stop their production 
we are also subject to product liability clauses and or intellectual property indemnification clauses in some of our customer contracts 
such clauses require us to pay financial penalties if we supply defective product  which results in financial damages to the customer  or to indemnify the customer for third party actions based on infringement by our product of others intellectual property 
as of december   we are unaware of any such claims by any of our customers 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we expect our operating expenses in the foreseeable future  particularly research and development expenses  sales and marketing expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
as a result  our net cash flows will depend heavily on the level of future sales and our ability to manage expenses 

table of contents currently  our expenses significantly exceed our cash receipts  and we expect this trend to continue 
although there can be no assurance  we believe that our current balances of cash and cash equivalents and investments will provide adequate liquidity to fund our operations and meet our other cash requirements for at least the next two years 
if our directors and officers liability insurance is insufficient or unavailable to cover the amount of any damages and defense costs that may result from our pending securities litigations  we may be required to pay the costs of indemnifying and defending certain of our directors and officers in addition to damages from our cash reserves 
directors and officers liability insurance may not be available to us in sufficient amounts to cover any claims made in securities litigation filed against us in the future 
we may find it necessary or we may choose to seek additional financing if our investment plans change  or if industry or market conditions are favorable for a particular type of financing 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds if needed 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
the effective date of sfas r is the first reporting period beginning after june   which is third quarter for calendar year companies  although early adoption is allowed 
sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with sfas we currently utilize a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a lattice model 
we have not yet determined which model we will use to measure the fair value of employee stock options upon the adoption of sfas r 
see note and to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
sfas r also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated  because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
we currently expect to adopt sfas r effective july   however  we have not yet determined which of the aforementioned adoption methods it will use 
we expect that the adoption of sfas r on july   will have a material impact on future operating results 
see note for further information on our stock based compensation plans 
on october   the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
the act creates a temporary incentive for us multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us at an effective tax rate of 
on november   the fasb issued proposed fasb staff position  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fas b 
fas b would allow companies additional time to evaluate the effect of 
table of contents the law on whether unrepatriated foreign earnings continue to qualify for sfas s exception to recognizing deferred tax liabilities and would require explanatory disclosures from those who need the additional time 
whether we will ultimately take advantage of this provision depends on a number of factors including reviewing future congressional guidance before a decision can be made 
at december   we were not able to reasonably estimate the income tax effects of repatriating foreign earnings 
factors affecting future operating results and stock price our success depends on the growth of the consumer electronics broadband communications market generally and the rf product market specifically 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of rf products into markets related to consumer electronics broadband communications applications 
these markets are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  and short product life cycles  especially in the pc and consumer electronics markets 
although the consumer electronics broadband communications market has grown in the past  it may not grow in the future or a significant market slowdown may occur 
further  the market segments we serve  in particular the cable set top box  cable modem  cable telephony  digital tv  pc tv  and handheld tv markets may not grow at a rate sufficient for us to achieve profitability 
because of the intense competition in the consumer electronics broadband communications market  the unproven technology of many products addressing the market and the short life cycles of many consumer products  it is difficult to predict the potential size and future growth rate of the overall rf product market 
in addition  the consumer electronics broadband communications market is transitioning from analog to digital  as well as expanding to new services  such as interactive television  handheld television and on demand services 
the future growth of the rf product market is partially dependent upon the market acceptance of products and technologies addressing the consumer electronics broadband communications market  and there is no assurance that the rf technologies upon which our products are based will be accepted by any of these markets 
if the demand for rf products is not as great as we expect  we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become successful 
we face intense competition in the consumer electronics broadband communications and rf tuner markets  which could reduce our market share in existing markets and affect our ability to enter new markets 
the markets we compete in are intensely competitive 
this competition has resulted and may continue to result in declining average selling prices for our rf products 
we expect competition to continue to increase as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter our target markets 
we compete with  or may in the future compete with  a number of major domestic and international suppliers of integrated circuit and system modules in the cable modem  pc tv  set top box  cable telephony  handheld tv  digital tv and transportation markets 
we compete primarily with tuner module manufacturers such as alps  philips electronics  samsung  and thomson  with semiconductor companies such as anadigics  analog devices  broadcom  freescale  lsi logic  maxim  philips semiconductors  rfmagic  st microelectronics  texas instruments  xceive and zarlink and potentially with new start up companies 
broadcom  in particular  is shipping a silicon tuner chipset that competes with our tuner products in the broadband cable markets 
several of our competitors have broader product and service offerings and could bundle their competitive tuner products with their other products and services 

table of contents many of our current and potential competitors have advantages over us  including longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases  significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  management  technical and other resources  relationships with potential customers as a result of the sales of other components  which can be leveraged into sales of products competitive with our rf products  and broader product and service offerings that may allow them to compete effectively by bundling their tuner products either by legal or illegal means 
as a result  our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
industry participants may consolidate  impacting our ability to compete in our markets 
consolidation by industry participants  including  in some cases  acquisitions of some of our customers  suppliers or partners by our competitors  or acquisitions of our competitors by our customers  suppliers or partners  could create entities with increased market share  customer base  technology and marketing expertise in markets in which we compete 
some of our suppliers or partners offer or may offer products that compete with our rf products 
depending on the participants  industry consolidation could significantly and adversely affect our current markets  the markets we are seeking to serve and our ability to compete successfully in those markets  thereby harming our results of operations 
if we do not anticipate and adapt to evolving industry standards in the rf tuner and consumer electronics broadband communications markets  or if industry standards develop more slowly than expected  our products could become obsolete and we could lose market share 
products for consumer electronics broadband communications applications often are based on industry standards that are continuously evolving 
we have often directed our development toward producing rf products that comply with the evolving standards 
in some cases  the development of these standards takes longer than originally anticipated 
the delayed development of a standard in our target markets has and could result in slower deployment of new technologies  which may harm our ability to sell our rf products  or frustrate the continued use of our proprietary technologies  due to the anticipation of the deployment of a standard 
the continued delay in the development of these industry standards could result in fewer manufacturers purchasing our rf products in favor of continuing to use the proprietary technologies designed by our competitors 
such delayed development of industry standards and the resulting slower deployment of new technologies would result in diminished and or delayed revenue and consequently harm our business 
further  if new industry standards emerge  our products or our customers products could become unmarketable or obsolete 
our ability to adapt to changes and to anticipate future standards and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards is a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth 
our inability to anticipate the evolving standards in the consumer electronics broadband communications market and  in particular  in the rf market  or to develop and introduce new products successfully into these markets  could result in diminished revenue and  consequently  harm our business 
in addition  we may incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these evolving standards 

table of contents other solutions for the consumer electronics broadband communications market compete with some of our solutions 
if these technologies prove to be more reliable  faster  less expensive or more popular  the demand for our rf products and our revenue may decrease 
some of our target market segments  such as cable modem and cable telephony services  are competing with a variety of non rf based broadband communications solutions  including digital subscriber line dsl technology 
many of these technologies may compete effectively with cable modem and cable telephony services 
if any of these competing technologies are more reliable  faster  less expensive  reach more customers or have other advantages over rf broadband technology  the demand for our rf products and  as a result  our revenue may decrease 
our research and development efforts are critical to our business and may not be successful 
our future operating results may be negatively affected as a result 
any future success will depend  in large part  upon our ability to develop new rf products for existing and new markets  including handheld tv  our ability to introduce these products in a cost effective and timely manner  and our ability to meet customer specifications and convince leading manufacturers to select these products for design into their new products 
the development of new rf products is highly complex and  from time to time  we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
in addition  some of our new product development efforts are focused on producing silicon products utilizing architectures and technologies with which we have little or no experience  and delivering performance characteristics  such as low power consumption  at levels that we have not previously achieved 
under some circumstances  we have failed 
for example  our bluetooth products never gained wide market acceptance 
we have had significant changes in our executive management and reduced the scope and costs of our worldwide operations 
because of our reduced scope of operations and management discontinuity  our research and development efforts in our core technologies may lag behind those of our competitors  some of whom have substantially greater financial resources than we have  and some of whom may have substantially greater technical resources and management continuity than we have 
as a result of these factors  we may be unable to develop and introduce new rf products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner  and any new products we develop and offer may never achieve market acceptance 
these failures would result in substantial harm to our operating results 
our business may be harmed if we fail to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
we currently have patents issued and pending in the us and in foreign countries 
we intend to seek further u 
s and international patents on our technology 
we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications  that patents will be issued in all countries where our products can be sold or that any claims will be allowed from pending applications or will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage 
our competitors also may be able to design around our patents 
the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the us  increasing the possibility of piracy of our technology and products 
although we intend to defend vigorously our intellectual property rights  we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
our competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
despite our efforts and procedures to protect our intellectual property through the prosecution of patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets and other methods  we cannot be assured that our current intellectual property or any intellectual property we may acquire through acquisitions or by other means will be free from third party claims which may be valid 
in connection with recent acquisitions  including the transilica acquisition  we conducted due diligence investigations of the intellectual property of these acquired companies 
table of contents for the purpose of assessing their protection efforts on their respective intellectual property 
we cannot be assured that our investigatory efforts uncovered all or any defects related to the protection of intellectual property we acquired 
as a result  intellectual property we acquire  including the intellectual property we acquired in the transilica acquisition or in other acquisitions  may not be free from third party claims 
any third party claims may lead to costly and time consuming litigation  which could harm our business and financial position 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may cause us to become involved in costly and lengthy litigation that could seriously harm our business and compromise our intellectual property position 
we have been involved in litigation and may become involved in litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or defend against allegations of infringement asserted by others 
legal proceedings could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidate our proprietary rights either through litigation or a petition for uspto re examination initiated by a competitor 
any litigation  regardless of its outcome  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management s time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to take specific actions  including ceasing the sale of our products that practice the asserted intellectual property of third parties  obtaining from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  or redesigning those products that infringe intellectual property of third parties 
as a result  the expense associated with intellectual property litigation  management s and engineering staff s diversion from daily operations of our business caused by such litigation  and any legal limitation placed upon our products and or our business related to such litigation may have a material and negative impact on our business and our financial results 
furthermore  we have initiated  and may initiate in the future  claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish their validity 
even if we successfully assert our intellectual property against a competitor in litigation  our patents may be attacked through a uspto re examination  which cannot be settled by the mutual agreement of the parties 
despite the settlement of all of our outstanding patent litigation with a competitor in the second quarter of  we must continue to prosecute the validity of our patent in the re examination proceedings initiated by that competitor 
if we are unsuccessful in such claims  others will be able to compete directly against us  which would materially  adversely affect our ability to sell our products and grow our business 
any current or future litigation by or against us  or one of our customers  could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical personnel and management  whether or not the litigation results in a favorable determination 
our ability to sell our rf products may suffer if any third party claims that we or our customers infringe on their intellectual property are valid  or if any of our issued patents are proven to be invalid 
the electronics industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
in addition  our customers may be subject to infringement claims for products incorporating our rf products 
if any claims of infringement are made against any of our customers  our customers may seek to involve us in the infringement claim and request indemnification from us 
if the claim resulted in an adverse result for our customer  it may reduce or completely eliminate marketing of its infringing product  which would decrease sales of our rf products to this customer 
further  if our customer prevailed in its claim for indemnification against us  or if we were found to infringe on any other third party intellectual property  we could be required to pay substantial damages and royalties on our historical and future product sales  indemnify our customers for their legal fees and damages paid  
table of contents stop manufacturing  using and selling the infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of some of our processes  or obtain licenses to the technology 
we may be unsuccessful in developing non infringing products or negotiating licenses upon reasonable terms 
these problems might not be resolved in time to avoid harming our results of operations or may never be resolved 
our customers products are subject to governmental regulation 
governmental regulation could place constraints on our customers and consequently minimize their demand for our rf products 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  has broad jurisdiction over several of our target markets in the us similar governmental agencies regulate our target markets in other countries 
although most of our products are not directly subject to current regulations of the fcc or any other federal or state communications regulatory agency  much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated is subject to direct government regulation 
accordingly  the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which they operate may  in turn  impede sales of our products 
for example  demand for our rf products will decrease if equipment incorporating our products fails to comply with fcc emissions specifications 
the sales cycle for our rf products is long  and we incur substantial non recoverable expenses and devote significant resources to sales that may not be realized when anticipated  if at all 
our customers  and sometimes their customers  typically conduct significant evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance procedures before they purchase our rf products 
as a result  we expend significant financial and human resources to develop customer relationships before we recognize any revenue from these relationships 
in fact  we may never recognize any revenue from these efforts 
our customers evaluation processes are frequently lengthy and may range from three months to one year or more 
in many situations  our customers design their products to specifically incorporate our rf products  and our rf products must be designed to meet their stringent specifications 
this process can be complex and may require significant engineering  sales  marketing and management efforts on our part 
this process may also require significant engineering and testing on the part of our customers and  if our customers do not have sufficient capabilities to complete the process  our revenue could be affected 
we customize a substantial portion of our rf subsystem module products to address our customers specific rf needs 
if we do not sell our customer specific products in large volumes  we may be unable to cover our fixed costs or may be left with substantial unsaleable inventory 
we manufacture a substantial portion of our rf subsystem module products to address the needs of individual customers 
frequent product introductions by systems manufacturers make our future success dependent on our ability to select development projects that will result in sufficient volumes to enable us to achieve manufacturing efficiencies to cover our fixed costs 
because some of our customer specific rf module products are developed for unique applications  we expect that some of our current and future customer specific rf module products may never be produced in volume and may impair our ability to cover our fixed costs 
in addition  if our customers fail to purchase these customized rf module products from us  we risk having substantial unsaleable inventory 
if we have substantial unsaleable inventory  our financial condition would be harmed 

table of contents if we are unable to continue to sell existing and new products to our key customers in significant quantities  or to attract new significant customers  our future operating results could be harmed 
we may not be able to maintain or increase sales to our key customers or to attract new significant customers for a variety of reasons  including the following most of our customers typically buy our rf products through a purchase order  rather than a supply agreement  which does not require them to purchase a minimum amount of our rf products  most of our customers can stop purchasing our rf products with limited notice to us without incurring any significant contractual penalty  many of our customers and potential customers have pre existing relationships with our current or potential competitors  which may affect their decision to purchase our rf products  some of our customers or potential customers offer or may offer products that compete with our rf products  our longstanding relationships with some of our larger customers may also deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our rf products  some of our customers or potential customers may limit their purchases from us unless a second wafer manufacturing source is developed  and many of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources 
if we do not maintain or increase sales to existing customers and attract significant new customers  our revenue would diminish and consequently our business would be harmed 
because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue  the loss of a key customer could seriously harm our business 
we have derived a substantial portion of our revenue from sales to a relatively small number of customers 
as a result  the loss of any significant customer could significantly harm our revenue 
sales to scientific atlanta and asustek computer for the benefit of arris and terayon accounted for approximately and  respectively  of consolidated net revenue for sales to daimlerchrysler and wpi accounted for approximately and of our revenue in sales to our ten largest customers  including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors  accounted for approximately and of our net revenue for and  respectively 
we believe that our future operating results will continue to depend on the success of our largest customers and on our ability to sell existing and new products to these customers in significant quantities 
the loss of a key customer or a reduction in our sales to any key customer could harm our revenue and consequently our financial condition 
during the first quarter of  the daimler chrysler subsidiary to which we sell am fm tuner modules was purchased by a competitor 
we were informed by the competitor that it would no longer purchase product from us beginning in the fourth quarter of uncertainties involving customer orders and shipment of our rf products could harm our business 
our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders  and we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers  including our most significant customers  in terms of volume of sales 
our terms and conditions typically provide that our customers may cancel orders scheduled to ship outside days 
further  terms typically provide that customers may reschedule orders that are scheduled to ship outside days  but customers typically are restricted to the number of days they can push out the ship date 
however  we have permitted customers to cancel orders less than days before the expected date of shipment and to re schedule shipments less than days before the expected date of shipment  with little or no penalty 

table of contents we extend credit to our customers  sometimes in large amounts  but there is no guarantee every customer will be able to pay our invoices when they become due 
at various times  our accounts receivable is concentrated in a few customers 
as part of our routine business  we extend credit to our customers and invoice them for goods 
at december   approximately of our net accounts receivable were due from five of our customers 
while customers may have the ability to pay on the date of shipment  or we believe customers have the ability to pay on the date credit is granted  their financial condition could change and there is no guarantee that customers will ever pay the invoices 
because all of our customers do not have the same credit terms  our outstanding accounts receivable balance can become concentrated in a smaller number of customers than our overall net revenue 
this concentration can subject us to a higher financial risk 
if we are unable to migrate our customers over time from our subsystem modules using discrete components to our rf silicon products or our subsystem modules that incorporate our rf silicon products  our operating results could be harmed 
our future success will depend on our ability to continue the successful migration of our customers from our subsystem modules that use discrete components to our rf silicon products  or to subsystem modules containing our silicon products  by convincing leading equipment manufacturers to select these products for design into their own products 
if we are not able to convince these manufacturers to incorporate our silicon products or modules containing our silicon products  our operating results could be harmed 
if we are unable to maintain certain purchase volumes from our subsystem module subcontractor  the cost of our subsystem module products could substantially increase and our operating results could be harmed 
the cost of our subsystem module products are directly affected by various factors  including our purchase volumes from our subsystem module subcontractor 
if we are successful in migrating our customers over time from our subsystem modules to our rf silicon products  our purchase volumes of subsystem module products could decrease 
if we are not able to negotiate favorable pricing in spite of potential volume decreases or attract new or existing customers to our subsystem module solutions  the cost of our subsystem module products could increase and our operating results could be harmed 
the average selling price of our products will likely decrease over time 
if the selling price reductions are greater than we expect  our operating results will be harmed 
historically  the average selling price of our products has decreased over their lives 
in addition  as the markets for rf integrated circuit and module products mature  we believe that it is likely that the average unit prices of our rf products will decrease in response to competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions  competitive product bundling and a transition in our markets from higher priced module products to lower priced integrated circuits 
to offset these decreases  we primarily rely on achieving cost reductions for materials used in existing products and on introducing new products that can often be sold at higher average selling prices or manufactured with lower costs 
although we will seek to increase the sales of our higher margin products  our sales and product development efforts may not be successful and our new products may not achieve market acceptance 
to the extent we are unable to reduce costs or sell our higher margin products  our results of operations may be adversely affected 

table of contents our inability to maintain or grow revenue from international sales could harm our financial results 
net revenue from outside of north america was and for and  respectively 
we plan to increase our international sales activities by adding international sales personnel  sales representatives or distributors 
our international sales will be limited if we cannot do so 
even if we are able to expand our international operations  we may not succeed in maintaining or increasing international market demand for our products 
we rely on business partners that could acquire  merge with or be acquired by our competitors which would limit our ability to deliver competitive products to our customers 
we rely upon some of our business partners for certain joint reference design and marketing activities 
in addition  some of our products are incorporated in some of our business partners reference designs that are provided to potential customers 
in the event that one of our business partners acquired one of our competitors or was acquired by one of our competitors  our business could be harmed 
product recall by a major customer could damage our business 
we generally warrant our commercial products for a period of one year  and longer for transportation electronics products 
if a customer experiences a problem with our products and subsequently returns our products to us in large quantities for rework  replacement  or refund  the cost to us could be significant and severely impact our financial results 
some of our customers require us to sign line down clauses  liability clauses and or noninfringement clauses 
we are currently subject to line down clauses in some contracts with our customers 
such clauses require us to pay financial penalties if our failure to supply product in a timely manner causes the customer to slow down or stop their production 
such a penalty could be large and  if incurred  could severely harm our financial results 
we are also subject to product liability clauses and or intellectual property indemnification clauses in some of our customer contracts 
such clauses require us to pay financial penalties if we supply defective product  which results in financial damages to the customer  or to indemnify the customer for third party actions based on infringement by our product of others intellectual property 
such a penalty could be large and  if incurred  could severely harm our financial results 
we expect our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 
our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are not in our control 
these factors include timing  cancellation and rescheduling of significant customer orders  which result in revenue variability from one quarter to another  the ability of our customers to procure the necessary components for their end products that utilize our rf tuners to conduct their operations as planned for any quarter  pricing concessions on volume sales to particular customers for established time frames  slowdowns in customer demand and related industry wide increases in inventories  our inability to predict our customers demand for our products  changes in our product and customer mix between quarters  labor disputes at our subcontractors manufacturing facility in the philippines or at any of our other subcontractors  which may cause temporary slowdowns or shutdowns of operations  
table of contents quality problems with our products that result in significant returns  inadequate allocation of wafer capacity for our silicon products and or allocation of components used in our module products  widespread acts of terrorism or military action occurring anywhere in the world  and acts of god  force majeure 
currency fluctuations related to our international operations could harm our financial results 
a significant portion of our international revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and we have experienced significant fluctuations in our financial results due to changing exchange rates rather than operational changes 
for example  we recognized a foreign currency exchange gain of approximately million in we expect currency fluctuations to continue  and such fluctuations may significantly impact our financial results in the future 
we may choose to engage in currency hedging activities to reduce these fluctuations  which may or may not prove to be successful 
our cash reserves may prove insufficient to sustain our business 
additionally  there is no guarantee our insurance coverages  including our directors and officers liability insurance  are sufficient to protect us  or that we will be able to obtain such insurance in the future 
currently  our expenses exceed our cash receipts  and we expect this trend to continue 
although there can be no assurance  we believe that our current balances of cash and cash equivalents and investments will provide adequate liquidity to fund our operations for at least the next two years 
if our directors and officers liability insurance is insufficient or unavailable to cover the amount of any damages and defense costs that may result from our pending securities litigation proceedings  we may be required to pay the costs of indemnifying and defending certain of our current and former directors and officers in addition to damages from our cash reserves 
directors and officers liability insurance may not be available to us in sufficient amounts to cover any claims made in securities litigation filed against us in the future 
we also purchase various insurance policies to cover specifically designated risks in varying amounts 
there is no guarantee that when a claim arises under any of the covered risks that our coverage will be sufficient to cover the entire claim or that any specific claim will be covered  even in part  by insurance 
also  there can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future 
these factors may result in rapid and substantial depletion of our cash reserves  and this depletion may result in our inability to properly operate our business 
we may be unable to obtain the capital required to grow our business 
from time to time  we may find it necessary or we may choose to seek additional financing if our investment plans change  or if industry or market conditions are favorable for a particular type of financing 
our capital requirements depend upon several factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our products  our ability to expand our customer base  our level of expenditures for sales and marketing  the cost of product and service upgrades and other factors 
if our capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds if needed 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced 
further  if we issue equity securities  the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock 
if we issue debt securities  the debt securities generally will have rights senior to those of existing holders of equity securities 
if we cannot raise funds  if needed  on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  any of which could harm our ability to grow our business 

table of contents our dependence on a single manufacturing facility and a single subcontractor for almost all of our subsystem modules solutions could jeopardize our operations 
the majority of our subsystem module solutions manufacturing operations are subcontracted to tfs 
such operations and are conducted at a single facility in manila  philippines  which tfs has announced it intends to sell 
if tfs is unable to sell the manila facility  we will be required to move to an alternative manufacturing facility operated by tfs or engage a new sub contractor 
the disruption caused by seeking and moving the manufacture of our products to an alternate facility or subcontractor could result in delays in our ability to deliver products to our customers or customer loss  which would have a negative impact on our business operations and our financial results 
additionally  there is no guarantee that a new manufacturing facility or subcontractor will supply products at the same cost as tfs manila facility  which would have a negative impact on our financial results 
if tfs is successful in selling its manila facility or if we move the manufacture of our products to an alternate facility or subcontractor  we would still be exposed to manufacturing risks as a result of our dependence on a single manufacturing facility and a single sub contractor for our subsystem module solutions 
such risks include labor disputes  terrorism  political unrest  war  process abnormalities  human error  theft  government intervention  or a natural disaster such as a fire  earthquake  or flood 
if we encounter any significant delays or disruptions  including those caused by our subcontractor s inability to procure component parts or supply us with product  we may not be able to meet our manufacturing and testing requirements  which could cause a significant delay in our ability to deliver our products  resulting in customer loss 
additionally  our subcontractor could elect to close its production facility or require us to move to another production facility or subcontractor 
any resulting delay could result in increased expense and costs and could have a negative impact on our business operations and our financial results 
we depend on third party wafer subcontractors to manufacture all of our integrated circuit products  which reduce our control over the integrated circuit manufacturing process  and could increase costs and decrease availability of our integrated circuit products 
we do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility 
we primarily rely on ibm and x fab  outside subcontractors  to produce most of our integrated circuit rf products 
we do not have a long term supply agreement with our subcontractors and instead obtain manufacturing services on a purchase order basis 
our subcontractors have no obligation to supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as set forth in a particular purchase order 
our requirements represent a small portion of the total production capacity of these subcontractors  and they may reallocate capacity to other customers even during periods of high demand for our integrated circuits 
if our subcontractors were to become unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our integrated circuits  our business would be seriously harmed 
as a result  we would have to identify and qualify substitute subcontractors  which would be time consuming and difficult  resulting in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems 
in addition  if competition for foundry capacity increases  our product costs may increase  and we may be required to pay significant amounts to secure access to manufacturing services 
if we do not qualify or receive supplies from additional subcontractors  we may be exposed to increased risk of capacity shortages due to our dependence on ibm and x fab 
in addition  the processing of our integrated circuit products are specific to the manufacturing processes of one or the other of our two suppliers and substantial lead time would be required to move the specific product to the other supplier  if it were possible at all 
further  our customers may limit their purchases from us unless a second manufacturing source is developed  which could impact our sales 
we depend on third party subcontractors for integrated circuit probe  packaging and testing  which reduces our control over the integrated circuit packaging process and testing and could increase costs and decrease availability of our integrated circuit products 
our integrated circuit products are probed  packaged  and or tested by independent subcontractors  including amkor  ase  ise and bridgepoint  using facilities located in south korea  philippines  and austin  texas 
we 
table of contents do not have long term agreements with these subcontractors and typically obtain services from them on a purchase order basis 
our reliance on these subcontractors involves risks such as reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs 
our reliance on bridgepoint involves additional risk due to its current bankruptcy proceedings 
these risks could result in product shortages or increase our costs of packaging our products 
if these subcontractors are unable or unwilling to continue to provide packaging and testing services of acceptable quality  at acceptable costs and in a timely manner  our business would be seriously harmed 
we would also have to identify and qualify substitute subcontractors  which could be time consuming and difficult and may result in unforeseen operations problems 
if our customers do not qualify our products or the manufacturing lines of our third party suppliers for volume shipments  our revenue may be delayed or reduced 
some customers will not purchase any of our products  other than limited numbers of evaluation units  prior to qualification of the manufacturing lines for the product 
we may not always be able to satisfy the qualifications 
delays or failure to qualify can cause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a significant loss of revenue 
if we change third party suppliers  customers may require us to qualify the supplier s facility  or a product manufactured by that facility 
our quality certifications are subject to periodic re evaluation 
our germany design facility is currently iso and iso certified 
these certifications and others are subject to recertification on a periodic basis 
the transfer of our module manufacturing to the control of tfs could have adverse consequences on our ability to obtain future certifications 
we believe that transitioning our silicon products to newer or better manufacturing process technologies will be important to our future competitive position 
if we fail to make this transition efficiently  our competitive position could be seriously harmed 
we continually evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to higher performance process technologies in order to produce more efficient or better integrated circuits 
we believe this migration is required to remain competitive 
other companies in the industry have experienced difficulty in migrating to new process technologies and  consequently  have suffered reduced yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels 
we may experience similar difficulties 
moreover  we are dependent on our relationships with subcontractors to successfully migrate to newer or better processes 
our foundry suppliers may not make newer or better process technologies available to us on a timely or cost effective basis  if at all 
if our foundry suppliers do not make newer or better process technologies available to us on a timely or cost effective basis  or if we experience difficulties in migrating to these processes  our competitive position and business prospects could be seriously harmed 
uncertainties in our production planning process could harm our business 
for many of our products  our manufacturing leadtime is greater than the delivery leadtimes we quote our customers 
therefore  in many cases we routinely manufacture or purchase inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our rf products  which demand is difficult to predict 
the cancellation or re scheduling of product orders  the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in our holding excess or obsolete inventory that could substantially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our inability to produce and ship rf products to our customers in a timely manner could harm our reputation and damage our relationships with our customers 

table of contents the semiconductor industry is cyclical 
if there is a sustained upturn in the semiconductor market  there could be a resulting increased demand for foundry and other subcontracted services  significantly reducing product availability and increasing our costs 
the semiconductor industry periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints 
an increased demand for semiconductors could substantially increase the cost of producing our rf products  and consequently reduce our profit margins 
as a result  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future results of operations due to general semiconductor industry conditions 
our international operations  including our operations in germany  taiwan  japan and korea  as well as our international suppliers operations  as well as our overall financial results  may be negatively affected by actions taken or events that occur in these countries or around the world 
we currently have facilities and suppliers located outside of the us  including research and development operations in germany and sales offices in japan  taiwan and korea 
other than ibm  ise and bridgepoint  substantially all of our suppliers are located outside the us  and substantially all of our products are manufactured outside the us as a result  our operations are affected by the local conditions in those countries  as well as actions taken by the governments of those countries 
for example  if the philippines government enacts restrictive laws or regulations  or increases taxes paid by manufacturing operations in that country  the cost of manufacturing our products in manila could increase substantially  causing a decrease in our gross margins and profitability 
in addition  if any country  including the us  imposes significant import restrictions on our products  our ability to import our products into that country from our international manufacturing and packaging facilities could be diminished or eliminated 
local economic and political instability in areas in the far east  in particular in the philippines and korea  where there has been political instability in the past  could result in unpleasant or intolerable conditions for workers  and ultimately could result in a shutdown of our facilities or our subcontractor s facilities 
our success could be jeopardized by loss of personnel  particularly key personnel  and our inability to attract qualified candidates 
any success we may have in the future will depend largely upon the continued service of our personnel  particularly our key personnel and executive management 
our success also will depend on our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
we rely heavily upon equity compensation incentives  specifically  we grant options to purchase our common stock to attract  retain and motivate our personnel 
the equity incentives of our competitors and other elements of our competitors compensation structures  particularly cash compensation  may be significantly more attractive than the compensation packages we offer 
with respect to retaining personnel  the market price of  or other price attainable for  our common stock directly affects the attractiveness and effectiveness of our stock options as a recruiting and retention tool 
in the past  our common stock price has been substantially higher than currently prevailing prices 
the present difficult operating environment  and or any poor operating performance we experience may cause the price of our common stock to decline from current levels 
in addition  due to the recent issuance of sfas no 
r  share based payment  requiring companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments in the financial statements  we may change our strategy for compensating employees 
the lower price  along with any related deterioration in the morale of our personnel regarding this component of their compensation  may result in our loss of personnel  including key personnel and executive management 
these personnel losses could reasonably be expected to have a prompt  material and adverse effect on our business and operations 
the competition for attracting qualified candidates is intense  particularly so in the rf silicon and rf system industries 
our ability to attract qualified candidates is essential to any success we may have in the future 
due to the reasons above  our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified technical  management  and other candidates necessary for the design  development  manufacture and sale of our rf products may be impaired  perhaps significantly 

table of contents provisions in our charter documents  delaware law and our rights plan may deter takeover efforts and  in part  impact our stock price 
several provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  amended and restated bylaws and stockholder rights plan may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that you may consider favorable and therefore may harm the stock price 
those provisions include authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock  providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of the board or the stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings  establishing super majority voting requirements in some instances  and providing rights to purchase fractional shares of preferred stock to our existing stockholders in the event of an acquisition attempt 
we are the target of several securities fraud class action complaints and are at risk of securities class action litigation 
this could result in substantial costs to us  drain our resources and divert our management s attention 
initial public offering litigation starting on july   multiple purported securities fraud class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
we are aware of at least three such complaints berger v 
goldman  sachs co  inc et al  atlas v 
microtune et al  and ellis investments ltd 
v 
goldman  sachs co  inc et al 
the complaints are brought purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased our common stock from august  through december  and are related to in re initial public offering securities litigation ipo cases 
the atlas complaint names as defendants microtune  douglas j 
bartek  our former chairman and chief executive officer  everett rogers  our former chief financial officer and vice president of finance and administration  and several investment banking firms that served as underwriters of our initial public offering 
microtune  mr 
bartek and mr 
rogers were served with notice of the atlas complaint on august   however  they have not been served regarding the other referenced complaints 
the berger and ellis investment ltd 
complaints assert claims against the underwriters only 
the complaints were consolidated and amended on may  the amended complaint alleges liability under and of the securities act of act claims and b and a of the securities exchange act of act claims  on the grounds that the registration statement for our initial public offering did not disclose that the underwriters had agreed to allow certain of their customers to purchase shares in the offering in exchange for excess commissions paid to the underwriters  and the underwriters had arranged for certain of their customers to purchase additional shares in the aftermarket at pre determined prices 
the amended complaint also alleges that false analyst reports were issued 
no specific amount of damages is claimed 
we are aware that similar allegations have been made in other lawsuits filed in the southern district of new york challenging over other initial public offerings and secondary offerings conducted in  and those cases have been consolidated for pretrial purposes before the honorable shira a 
scheindlin 
on february   the court ruled on all defendants motions to dismiss 
the court denied the motions to dismiss the act claims 
the court did not dismiss the act claims against us and other issuers and underwriters 
we have accepted a settlement proposal presented to all issuer defendants 
under the settlement  plaintiffs will dismiss and release all claims against the microtune defendants 
the insurance companies collectively 
table of contents responsible for insuring the issuer defendants in all of the ipo cases will guarantee plaintiffs a recovery of billion  an amount that covers all of the ipo cases 
under this guarantee  the insurers will pay the difference  if any  between billion and the amount collected by the plaintiffs from the underwriter defendants in all of the ipo cases 
the microtune defendants will not be required to pay any money in the settlement 
however  any payment made by the insurers will be charged to the respective insurance policies covering each issuer s case on a pro rata basis that is  the total insurance company payments will be divided by the number of cases that settle 
if the pro rata charge exceeds the amount of insurance coverage for an issuer  that issuer would be responsible for additional payments 
the proposal also provides that the insurers will pay for the company s legal fees going forward 
the settlement will require approval of the court  which cannot be assured 
class action litigation beginning in february  microtune  our former chairman of the board and chief executive officer  douglas j 
bartek  our former chief financial officer and vice president of finance and administration  everett rogers  our former president and chief operating officer  william l

table of contents securities and exchange commission investigation on august   we received written notification that microtune is the subject of an investigation by the securities and exchange commission sec 
the sec advised microtune that the process under way is a fact finding investigation 
we believe the investigation relates directly to the internal inquiry commissioned by the audit committee of our board in we are cooperating fully with the sec  and we have had discussions with the sec regarding the possible settlement of this matter 
changes in the accounting treatment of stock options will adversely affect our results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
the effective date of sfas r is the first reporting period beginning after june   which is third quarter for calendar year companies  although early adoption is allowed 
this change in accounting treatment will materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations as the stock based compensation expense will be charged directly against our reported earnings 
for an illustration of the effect of such a change in our recent results of operations  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
investor confidence and share value may be adversely impacted if we and our independent registered public accounting firm are unable to provide adequate attestation over the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of the securities and exchange commission  as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal controls over financial reporting in its annual reports on form k that contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  the company s independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
this requirement will continue to apply to our future annual reports on form k 
although we intend to diligently and vigorously review our internal controls over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the section requirements  there is no assurance that we will be successful in future years 
further  if our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal controls over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented  designed  operated or reviewed  or if the independent registered public accounting firm interprets the requirements  rules or regulations differently from us  then they may decline to attest to management s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which ultimately could negatively impact the market price of our shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in the factors affecting future operating results and stock price section 
risks related to foreign currency exchange rates we transact both sales and purchases in foreign currencies 
due to the volatile nature of the currency markets  there is a potential risk of foreign currency translation losses  as well as gains 
as a result  our financial 
table of contents results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we produce and distribute our products 
a portion of our net revenue is transacted in the euro 
during  we generated approximately million in net revenue from euro denominated transactions 
the potential loss in net revenue for resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have been approximately million 
a significant portion of our operations consists of design and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
our products are manufactured in the philippines  germany  and korea as well as the united states 
we incur operating costs in currencies other than the us dollar  particularly the euro 
during  we incurred approximately million in operating costs from euro denominated transactions  mostly at our germany design facility 
the potential increase in operating costs for resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have been approximately million 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge our balance sheet exposures against future movements in exchange rates 
however  we are currently evaluating our exchange risk management strategy  including changes in our organizational structure and other capital structuring techniques to manage our currency risk 
our net investment in foreign subsidiaries  translated to us dollars using exchange rates at december   was million 
a potential loss in the value of net monetary assets related to this net investment resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately million 
risks related to interest rates currently  our cash and cash equivalents are invested in bank deposits and money market funds 
our investments  which consist of corporate debt securities and other securities issued by us government and state agencies  including auction rate securities  are comprised of high quality securities in accordance with our investment policy 
we account for these investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the carrying value of the cash equivalents approximates fair market value 
investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity when we have the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
held to maturity investments are carried at amortized cost with the amortization of the purchase discount recorded in interest income 
investments in debt securities not classified as held to maturity and equity securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  recorded in stockholders equity 
our investments are subject to interest rate risk  the risk that our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected due to movements in interest rates 
if interest rates were to decrease by basis points  our investment income would decrease by approximately million based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments as of december
