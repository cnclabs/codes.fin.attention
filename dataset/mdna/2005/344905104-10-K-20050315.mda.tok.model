item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements  and the footnotes thereto  contained elsewhere in this report and the statements regarding forward looking information and the factors that could affect our future financial performance described below in this report 
our principal operating subsidiary is foothill independent bank the bank  which is a california state chartered bank and a member of the federal reserve system 
the bank accounts for substantially all of our consolidated revenues and income 
accordingly  the following discussion focuses primarily on the bank s operations and financial condition 
forward looking statements the discussion below in this section of this annual report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the act 
those sections of the act and act provide a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their financial performance so long as they provide meaningful  cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from projected results 
forward looking statements often include the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  estimate  project  or words of similar meaning  or future or conditional verbs such as will  would  should  could  or may 
any statements as to our expectations or beliefs concerning  or projections or forecasts of  our future financial performance or future financial condition  or with respect to trends in our business or in our markets  are forward looking statements 
factors that could affect our future operating results and cause them to differ  possibly significantly  from those currently anticipated are described in this section of this report  including in the subsections entitled critical accounting policies and factors that could affect our future financial performance and  accordingly  this section of this report should be read in its entirety 
critical accounting policies overview 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and general practices in the banking industry 
the information contained within our financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
however  the carrying value of some of our assets can be affected by the estimates and judgments we make about anticipated future events and circumstances and business and economic trends  and their effects on our operating results 
in many cases  the occurrence or non occurrence and the effects of those events and circumstances are outside of our control 
as a consequence  if events or circumstances  or their consequences  turn out differently than we had anticipated when we made our estimates or judgments  our operating results in the future also could prove to be different  possibly materially  than those that are currently expected 
judgments regarding reserves for potential loan losses 
the accounting policies we follow in determining the sufficiency of the reserves we establish for possible loan losses require us to make judgments and assumptions about economic and market conditions and trends that can affect the ability of our borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations 
for example  if economic or market conditions were to change in an unexpectedly adverse manner or interest rates were to increase beyond the levels expected by us when we established the reserves for loan losses  those changed conditions could increase the risks of borrower payment defaults  which could require us to increase our reserves for possible future loan losses 
since reserves are increased by a charge against income known as the provision for loan losses  such changed conditions could cause our earnings to decline in the period when those increases are recorded 
a more detailed discussion regarding the provision for loan losses is set forth below in the subsection entitled results of operation provision for loan losses 
additionally  conditions or events of this nature could require us to reduce the carrying values of the loans that are affected by these conditions often referred to as loan write downs or loan charge offs 
since loans represent the largest component of our total assets  unanticipated changes in economic or market conditions potentially can have a significant effect on the amount of our reported assets as set forth on our balance sheet 

table of contents utilization of deferred income tax benefits 
the provision that we make for income taxes in our statements of income is based on  among other things  our ability to use certain income tax benefits available under state and federal income tax laws to reduce our income tax liability 
as of december   the total of the unused income tax benefits referred to in our consolidated financial statements as a deferred tax asset  available to reduce our income taxes in future periods was  those tax benefits will expire over time unless used and  therefore  the realization of those tax benefits is dependent on our generating taxable income in the future in amounts sufficient to enable us to use those tax benefits prior to their expiration 
we have made a judgment  based on historical experience and current and anticipated market and economic conditions and trends  that it is more likely than not that we will generate taxable income in future years sufficient to fully use those benefits 
in the event  however  that our income was to decline in future periods  making it less likely that those benefits could be fully used  we would be required to establish a valuation reserve to cover the potential loss of those tax benefits 
the creation of such an allowance would result in an increase in the provision we make for income taxes  and  therefore  would have the effect of reducing our net income 
results of operations overview of fiscal operating results the principal determinant of a banking organization s income is its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest that a bank earns on loans  investments and other interest earning assets  and its interest expense  which consists primarily of the interest it must pay to attract and retain deposits and the interest that it pays on other interest bearing liabilities 
a bank s interest income and interest expense are  in turn  affected by a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control  that affect interest rates and also the demand for loans and the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations 
those factors include the monetary policies of the federal reserve board  national and local economic conditions  and competition from other depository institutions and financial services companies 
the following table sets forth information regarding the interest income that we generated  the interest expense that we incurred  and our net interest income and our net earnings  in the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands interest income interest expense net interest income net income during the federal reserve board adopted and began implementing a monetary policy that was designed to reduce market rates of interest in an effort to stimulate the us economy  which was heading into recession 
that policy continued throughout and  as a hoped for economic recovery had been slow to develop 
pursuant to that policy  the federal reserve board reduced interest rates throughout that period  which caused the prime rate of interest charged by most banks to decline from a high of to in  to in november and  finally  to in june those monetary policies  combined with the continued softness in the united states economy  caused the average rate of interest earned on our interest earning assets to decline to in fiscal from in fiscal and from in fiscal despite these declines in the yields on our interest earning assets  in fiscal we achieved a  or  increase in net earnings to nearly million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase in net income in was primarily attributable to an increase of million in net interest income  an increase in non interest bearing demand and lower interest bearing savings and money market deposits  and a decline in higher interest bearing time deposits  in each case relative to total deposits  which largely offset the effect of an increase in the volume of total deposits and increasing interest rates on interest expense  and a reduction in the growth of non interest expenses  which increased by only  or less than  in as compared to  even though our total revenues net interest income plus other income increased by million or in fiscal 
table of contents as the following table indicates  net earnings for represented a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of  compared to and  respectively  for return on assets return on equity dividend payout ratio equity to asset ratio on june   the federal reserve board increased targeted interest rates by one quarter percent  the first such increase in three and one half years 
since then  the frb has increased interest rates on five additional occasions  the most recent occurring on february   each time by one quarter percent 
those increases  in turn  have led to increases in our prime rate of interest  as well as those charged by most banks  to a current level of 
current forecasts project further increases in the prime rate of interest to or by the end of calendar if those projected interest rate increases do occur  we expect that our net interest margin and  therefore  also our net interest income will increase modestly during the fiscal year ending december  results of operations for the years ended december  and net interest income

net yields were determined inclusive of loan fees 
net yields were determined exclusive of loan fees 
increase in interest income 
the increase in interest income in fiscal was primarily attributable to the following factors set forth in order of importance in terms of their effect on interest income increases in loan volume and in the volume of investment securities  and an increase in loan prepayment fees  due to refinancings of mortgage loans  or mortgage loan payoffs on sales of real properties  by borrowers who chose to take advantage of declining interest rates or increasing property values in our markets 

table of contents although these mortgage loan refinancings and payoffs generated increased fee income that helped to increase our interest income in  they could have the effect of reducing average yields on outstanding loans and  therefore  our net interest margin in future periods  because the loans that were refinanced or repaid generally bore interest at higher rates than the other loans in our loan portfolio 
increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the increase in the volume of interest bearing checking  savings and money market deposits  partially offset by a decline in time deposits which bear higher rates of interest 
information regarding average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

net interest margin  rate sensitivity and market risk 
net interest margin and rate sensitivity 
net interest margin is the difference between the interest we earn on our loans and other interest earning assets  on the one hand  and the interest we pay on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities on the other hand  and is the principal determinant of net interest income 

table of contents like other banking organizations  our net interest margin is affected by a number of factors  including the relative percentages or the mix of our assets  between loans  on the one hand  on which we are able to obtain higher rates of interest  and investment securities  federal funds sold and funds held in interest bearing deposits with other financial institutions  on the other hand  on which yields generally are lower  variable and fixed rate loans in the loan portfolio  and demand  savings and money market deposits  on the one hand  and higher priced time deposits  on the other hand 
impact of changes in the mix of earning assets and in the mix of interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in net interest income in was due primarily to i an increase in the volume of our outstanding loans  which we believe was attributable principally to marketing programs conducted in  ii an increase in the volume of investment securities  funded  in part  from reductions in other  lower yielding  earning assets  and iii the effects of a decline in interest rates paid on interest bearing deposits during the first nine months of  coupled with a reduction in the volume of our higher priced time deposits that resulted from a decision we made to allow some of those deposits to run off rather than to seek their renewal 
the following table sets forth changes in interest earned  including loan fees  and interest paid in each of the years ended december  and and the extent to which those changes were attributable to changes in the volume or changes in the mix of interest earning assets and changes in the volume or changes in the mix of interest bearing liabilities 
changes in interest earned and interest paid due both to rate and volume changes have been allocated to the change due to volume and the change due to rate in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the changes in each category

impact on net interest margins of the mix of fixed and variable rate loans 
as a general rule  in an interest rate environment characterized by declining market rates of interest  which occurred during the period from to mid  a bank with a relatively high percentage of variable rate loans would experience a decline in net interest margins because such loans would have repriced automatically when market rates of interest declined 
by contrast  as a general rule  a bank with a large proportion of fixed rates loans would have experienced an increase in net interest margins  because i the interest rates on those fixed rate loans would not have declined in response to declines in market rates of interest although such declines might eventually have resulted in early prepayments of some of those loans by borrowers seeking to refinance at lower rates of interest  and ii the interest paid on its deposits would have declined 
in a period of increasing interest rates  however  the interest margin of banks with a high proportion of fixed rate loans generally will suffer because they will be unable to reprice those loans to fully offset the increase in the rates of interest they must offer to retain maturing time deposits and attract new deposits 
a bank with a higher proportion of variable loans in an environment of increasing market rates of interest will  on the other hand  generally be able to offset more fully the impact of rising rates of interest on the amounts they must pay to retain existing and attract new deposits 
the following table sets forth the maturities of our loans  and the mix of fixed and variable rate loans  as of december  in thousands maturing within one year one to five years after five years total total fixed rate loans total variable rate loans total impact on net interest margins of the mix of demand  savings and time deposits 
in a period of declining market rates of interest  all other things being equal  a bank with a greater proportion of demand  savings and money market deposit accounts core deposits  as compared to time deposits  is likely to have  at least for the short term  a higher interest margin than a bank with a greater proportion of time deposits 
a bank with a higher proportion of time deposits must wait for its time deposits to mature before it can implement reductions in the rates of interest it must pay on those deposits in response to declining market rates of interest 
by contrast  such reductions can be implemented more quickly on savings and money market deposits 
in a period of increasing market rates of interest  all other things being equal  a bank with a higher proportion of time deposits will generally have  at least for the short term  a higher interest margin than a bank with a higher proportion of savings deposits and a lower proportion of time deposits  because a bank need not increase the interest it pays on its time deposits until they mature  while it will usually have to increase its interest rates on savings and money market deposits to be able to retain them in response to increasing market rates of interest and competition from other depository institutions 
the average amounts in thousands of and the average rates paid on our deposits  by type  in the year ended december  are summarized below year ended december  average balance average rate noninterest bearing demand deposits savings deposits time deposits total deposits market risk and net interest margin in and as demonstrated by the impact of the reductions in market rates of interest during the three year period that ended in june  our net interest margin and  therefore  our net interest income and net earnings are affected by changes in market rates of interest which we sometimes refer to as market risk 
we attempt to reduce our exposure to market risk associated with interest rate fluctuations by seeking i to attract and maintain a significant volume of demand and savings deposits that are not as sensitive to interest rate fluctuations or as costly as are time deposits  ii to match opportunities to reprice interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in response to changes in market rates of interest  and iii to change the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in a manner that is designed to achieve increases in net interest income 

table of contents in an effort to counteract the downward pressure on net interest margin  during the past year we have i continued sales and marketing programs that are designed to increase our volume of loans  on which yields are higher than other earning assets  ii continued marketing programs designed to attract lower cost and less volatile core deposits while allowing higher priced time deposits to run off  in order to reduce our interest expense  and iii continued a loan repricing policy  first implemented in  which places an interest rate floor  currently at  that is applicable to all new variable interest rate loans that we make 
there is also an interest cap on these loans  which is currently at 
as a result of these measures  at december  the volume of outstanding loans was million  or  greater than at december   the volume of demand  savings and money market deposits was million  or  greater than at december   and represented of total deposits as compared to at december   and time deposits including those in denominations of  or more represented  of total deposits  as compared to at december  despite these measures  our net interest margin that is  tax adjusted net interest income stated as a percentage of average interest earning assets was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  that decline was primarily due to the decrease in market rates of interest during the first nine months of however  notwithstanding that decline we believe that our net interest margin continues to exceed the average net interest margin for california based  publicly traded banks and bank holding companies with assets ranging from million to billion peer group banks  primarily because we have been able to maintain the ratio of demand and savings deposits to total deposits at a higher level than that of the peer group banks and to increase the volume of our loans which generate higher yields than do our other interest earning assets 
the ability to maintain our net interest margin is not entirely within our control  however  because the interest rates we are able to charge on loans and the interest rates we must offer to maintain and attract deposits are affected by national monetary policies established and implemented by the federal reserve board and by competitive conditions in our service areas 
moreover  the effect on a bank s net interest margin of changes in market rates of interest is affected by the types and maturities of its earning assets and deposits 
for example  a bank with a relatively high percentage of fixed rate loans will often encounter an increase in prepayments of those loans during periods characterized by declining market rates of interest  thereby offsetting the potential positive impact of the fixed rate loans on net interest margins 
additionally  a change in interest rates paid on deposits in response to changes in market rates of interest can be implemented more quickly in the case of savings deposits and money market accounts than with respect to time deposits as to which a change in interest rates generally cannot be implemented until such deposits mature 
also  a change in rates of interest paid on deposits can and often does lead consumers to move their deposits from one type of deposit to another or to shift funds from deposits to non bank investments or from such investments to bank deposit accounts or instruments  which will affect a bank s net interest margin 
provision for loan and lease losses 
like virtually all banking organizations  we follow the practice of maintaining a reserve the loan loss reserve for possible losses on loans and leases that occur from time to time as an incidental part of the banking business 
when it is determined that payment in full of a loan has become unlikely  the carrying value of the loan is reduced to what we estimate is its realizable value 
this reduction  which is referred to as a loan charge off or write down  is charged against and  to that extent  reduces the amount of our loan loss reserve 
we also periodically increase the loan loss reserve i to replenish that reserve after it has been reduced due to loan charge offs  ii to reflect changes in the volume of our outstanding loans  and iii to take account of increases in the risk of potential losses  which can occur due to a deterioration in the condition of borrowers or in the value of the property or other assets securing non performing loans  or due to adverse changes in national or local economic conditions 
those increases and additions are made through a charge against income referred to as the provision for loan and lease losses 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are added back to and  to that extent  increase the loan loss reserve and  therefore  may reduce the amount of the provision that we would need to make to maintain the loan loss reserve at a level that we believe to be adequate 
we employ economic models that are based on bank regulatory guidelines  industry standards and historical experience  to evaluate and determine the adequacy of our loan loss reserve and  therefore  also the amount of the provision that we make for potential loan losses 
however  those determinations involve judgments or forecasts about 
table of contents existing economic trends and future economic and market conditions  and about the impact those trends and conditions may have on the ability of borrowers to repay their loans 
those judgments and forecasts are subject to uncertainties over which we have no control 
as a result  actual trends or future conditions and their effects on the performance of our loan portfolio may differ  possibly significantly  from those anticipated by us at the time we make judgments about the adequacy of our loan loss reserve and the need to make additional provisions for potential loan losses 
additionally  the actual performance of our portfolio of loans in the future also can be affected by unanticipated events or conditions that might affect our particular service areas  such as earthquakes or other natural disasters 
see the discussion above under the caption critical accounting policies and below under the caption factors that could affect our future financial performance 
since loans represent the largest portion of our total assets  these judgments and forecasts can have a significant effect on the amount of our reported assets as set forth on our balance sheet 
those judgments also determine the amount of the provisions we make for possible loan losses and  therefore  can have a significant effect on our operating results  as well 
if conditions or circumstances change from those that were expected at the time those judgments or forecasts were made  it could become necessary to increase the loan loss reserve by making additional provisions for loan losses that would adversely affect our operating results 
additionally  to the extent those conditions or events were to result in loan charge offs  the total amount of our reported loans would decline as well 
one circumstance that could affect the adequacy of our loan loss reserve would be an adverse change in the financial condition of some of our borrowers 
as a result  we review trends in loan delinquencies and in non accrual loans as one of the indicators of the financial condition of our borrowers 
an increase in loan delinquencies or non accrual loans would indicate that some of our borrowers are encountering financial difficulties  while a decline in loan delinquencies and  particularly in non accrual loans  would suggest that borrowers are not encountering such financial problems 
the following table sets forth an analysis of our loan loss experience  by category  for the past three years with dollars in thousands 
year ended december  average amount of loans and leases outstanding loan and lease loss reserve at beginning of year charge offs domestic loans commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer lease financing other total charge offs recoveries domestic loans commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer total recoveries net recoveries net charge offs additions charged to operations loan and lease loss reserve balance at end of year ratios net charge offs to average loans leases outstanding during the year loan loss reserve to total gross loans net loan charge offs to loan loss reserve net loan charge offs to provision for loan losses loan loss reserve to non performing loans net of unearned discount 
we do not have any loans outstanding to borrowers in foreign countries and therefore there are no foreign loan charge offs or recoveries to report for any of the periods presented in the table above 

table of contents we did not make any provisions for potential loan losses during by contrast  in we made provisions totaling  our decision not to make any provisions in for potential loan losses was based on our review of the quality of our loans  our historical loan loss experience in the prior two years during which loan losses were immaterial despite difficult economic conditions  and our forecasts of economic and market trends  all of which led us to conclude that our loan loss reserve remained adequate to cover possible future loan losses 
at december  the loan loss reserve was approximately  or of total loans and leases outstanding  compared to approximately  or of total loans and leases outstanding at december  while we did not make a provision in for potential loan losses  we did make a  provision to the reserve for potential losses on off balance sheet commitments in the third quarter of that provision  which is recorded as part of our other expenses  was necessitated by an increase in the balance of outstanding unfunded lines of credit during that period and was not due to any perceived change of an adverse nature in the financial condition of customers to which unfunded lines of credit had been made 
at december   non performing loans which consist primarily of loans for which there have been no payments of principal or interest for more than days totaled  or of total loans then outstanding  compared to  or  of total loans outstanding at december  and  or of total loans outstanding at december  as a result of that improvement  the ratio of our loan loss reserve to non performing loans improved to  at december   as compared to and at december  and  respectively 
non interest income 
the following table identifies the components of and the percentage changes in non interest income in as compared to year ended december  increase decrease vs 
dollars in thousands non interest income services fees gain on sale of sba loans n m other the decrease in non interest income was primarily attributable to decreases in transaction fees and service charges collected on deposits and other banking transactions as compared to non interest expense 
non interest expense also sometimes referred to as other expense consists primarily of i salaries and other employee expenses  ii occupancy and furniture and equipment expenses  and iii other operating and miscellaneous expenses  such as insurance premiums  marketing expenses  data processing costs  professional fees and provisions made to establish contingency reserves  such as the  provision to the reserve for potential losses on off balance sheet commitments discussed above 
in order to attract a higher volume of non interest bearing demand and lower cost savings and money market deposits as a means of maintaining the bank s net interest margin  it has been our policy to provide a higher level of personal service to our customers than the level of service that is typically provided by many of our competitors 
as a result  we have more banking personnel than many of our competitors of comparable size  which is reflected in our non interest expense 
however  we believe that this higher level of service has helped us to retain our existing deposit customers and attract new customers  which has enabled us to achieve an average net interest margin that exceeds the average net interest margin of the banks in our peer group 
set forth below is information regarding non interest expense incurred by us in the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease vs 
non interest expenses salaries and employee benefits net occupancy expense of premises furniture and equipment expenses other expenses efficiency ratio 
table of contents as the table above indicates  non interest expense increased only modestly in  as compared to  as reductions in employee compensation expenses substantially offset increases in our net occupancy expense and expenses incurred in procuring additional equipment and furnishings 
as a result of the fact that  in  non interest expense increased by only  while our net interest income increased by nearly million  we were able to improve our efficiency ratio to from in the efficiency ratio is  basically  the ratio of non interest expense adjusted to exclude non recurring expenses to the sum of net interest income and non interest income as adjusted to exclude any non recurring income 
income taxes 
the following table sets forth comparative information regarding the provisions that we made for income taxes and our effective income tax rates for the periods ended december  and  respectively income before income taxes provision for income taxes effective tax rate the increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily the result of the increases in our pre tax income 
as discussed above  under the caption critical accounting policies our effective income tax rates reflect the beneficial impact of our ability to use certain income tax benefits available under state and federal income tax laws 
financial condition total assets 
our total assets increased during by approximately million  or  to million at december  from million at december  contributing to the growth of our assets in were increases of million  or  in outstanding loans and million  or  in our investment portfolio

we have established liquidity management policies which are designed to achieve a matching of sources and uses of funds in order to enable us to fund our customers requirements for loans and for deposit withdrawals 
in accordance with those policies  we maintain a number of short term sources of funds to meet periodic increases in loan demand and deposit withdrawals and maturities 
at december   the principal sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash and demand balances due from other banks and million of federal funds sold and overnight repurchase agreements which  together  totaled million 
other sources of liquidity include million in securities available for sale  of which approximately million mature within one year  million in securities held to maturity which mature within one year  and million in interest bearing deposits at other financial institutions  which mature in months or less 
in addition  substantially all of the bank s installment loans and leases  the amount of which aggregated million at december   require regular installment payments from customers  providing us with a steady flow of internally generated cash 
we also have a revolving line of credit from the federal home loan bank  under which available and unused borrowings totaled million as of december  borrowings under that credit line are secured by a pledge of some of our outstanding loans 
we also have established loan facilities that would enable us to borrow up to million of federal funds from other banks and we have an account with the federal reserve bank of san francisco that will also allow us to borrow at its discount window should the need arise 
finally  if necessary  we could obtain additional cash by selling time certificates of deposit into the cd market 
however  as a general rule  it has been and continues to be our policy to make use of borrowings under the credit line or loan facilities to fund short term cash requirements  before selling securities or reducing deposit balances at other banks and before selling time certificates of deposit 
cash flows 
net cash provided by operations 
during the year ended december  operations generated net cash of million as compared to million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in interest and fee income generated by our interest earning assets and a million increase in service fees and other income 
by contrast  cash outflows from operations  principally interest paid on interest bearing deposits and cash paid to fund employee compensation expense and accounts payable  increased by only  in as compared to net cash used in investment activities 
in  we used cash of approximately million for investment activities  consisting primarily of purchases of securities held for sale and increases in loan volume  that were funded primarily by sales of lower yielding held for sale securities  funds from increases in deposits  and decreases in the amount of deposits held at other banks 
net cash provided by financing activities 
financing activities  consisting primarily of a million increase in deposits and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options  generated net cash of million in  as compared to million in we used that cash in to fund the increases  as described above  in interest earning assets  principally loans and available for sale securities  and to pay cash dividends to our stockholders totaling million and to repurchase  of our outstanding shares

as of december   the amounts of our future minimum payment obligations stated in thousands under real property and equipment leases were year amount thereafter total maturing time certificates of deposits 
set forth below is a maturity schedule  as of december   of domestic time certificates of deposit of  or more with amounts stated in thousands at december  three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months total based on our historical experience  we believe that at least of these time certificates of deposit will be renewed by depositors  unless we decide to reduce the volume of such deposits by reducing the interest rates we will pay to maintain them 
junior subordinated debentures 
pursuant to rulings of the federal reserve board  bank holding companies have been permitted to issue long term subordinated debt instruments that will  subject to certain conditions  qualify as  and augment  capital for regulatory purposes 
pursuant to those rulings  in december of we issued  of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures the debentures to an institutional investor as part of a pooled securitization transaction by that investor 
the trust preferred securities were issued and sold by a grantor trust  of which we own all of the outstanding common securities  and the net proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities were paid to us in exchange for the issuance of the debentures to the trust 
the payment terms of the junior subordinated debentures correspond to the payment terms of the trust preferred securities and payments on the debentures have been and in the future will be used to make interest and principal payments that come due to the institutional investor on the trust preferred securities 
the debentures are subordinated to all of our existing and future borrowings and mature on december   but are redeemable  at par  at our option beginning december  we are required to make quarterly interest payments on these debentures at an interest rate which  as of december   was above the three month libor rate london inter bank offered rate 
the interest rate resets quarterly and the interest rate on the debentures for the three month period ending march  is 
until december  we consolidated the trust into our consolidated financial statements and in accordance with a ruling issued by the federal reserve board  reported the net amount of the trust preferred securities it had issued as tier capital for regulatory purposes 
in accordance with fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which was adopted and became effective on december   we have ceased consolidating the trust into our consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of fin no 
created uncertainty for us  as well as other bank holding companies that had issued similar debentures  as to whether the debentures would continue to qualify as tier capital  because we could no longer consolidate the trust into our consolidated financial statements 
however  on february   the federal reserve board issued a new rule which provides that  notwithstanding the deconsolidation of such trusts  junior subordinated debentures  such as those issued by us  may continue to constitute up to of a bank holding company s tier capital  subject to certain new limitations which will not become effective until march  and which  in any event  are not expected to affect the treatment of the company s debentures as tier capital for regulatory purposes 

table of contents during the second quarter of  million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the debentures were used to purchase bank owned life insurance policies on key management employees of the bank  with the bank as the beneficiary under such policies 
the purposes of bank owned life insurance commonly known in the banking industry as boli are i to enable the bank to offer employee retirement and benefit plans designed to attract and retain key management employees  by providing the bank with a source of funds primarily from the cash surrender value of such policies that the bank can use to pay benefits under those plans  and ii to protect the bank against the costs or losses that could occur as a result of the death of any key management employee 
the remainder of the proceeds from the issuance of the debentures will be used to fund the continued growth of the bank and may also be used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase plan 
deferred compensation obligations 
we maintain a nonqualified  unfunded deferred compensation plan for certain key management personnel 
under this plan  participating management employees may defer compensation  in return for which those employees will receive certain payments upon retirement  death  or disability  consisting of payments for years commencing upon retirement or reduced benefits upon early retirement  disability  or termination of employment 
at december   our aggregate payment obligations under this plan totaled million 
based on the age of the participants in this plan  it is our current expectation that this amount would be paid over a period that should range from the year to the year in order to provide funds to pay these benefits  we purchased life insurance policies on the participants in this plan  the cash surrender values or death benefits of which are designed to cover the payments that we will become obligated to make to plan participants 
supplemental executive retirement plan 
we maintain a nonqualified  unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan for certain key management personnel 
under this plan  participating employees are eligible to receive of their final average monthly salary upon reaching years of age and completing years of service with the bank 
this plan provides for payments for fifteen years commencing upon retirement 
at december   our aggregate payment obligations under this plan totaled million 
based on the age of the participants in this plan  it is our current expectation that this amount would be paid over a period that should range from to in order to provide funds to pay these benefits  we have purchased life insurance policies on a group of employees of the bank  the cash surrender values or death benefits of which are designed to cover the payments that we will become obligated to make to plan participants 
loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
in the ordinary course of business we make commitments to extend credit and issue standby commercial letters of credit to or for our customers 
at december  and  contractual commitments to extend credit to customers totaled million and million  respectively  and obligations under standby letters of credit totaled and million  respectively  at the end of each of those years 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and the customer may be required to pay a fee and meet other conditions in order to draw on those commitments or standby letters of credit 
we expect  based on historical experience  that many of the commitments will expire without being drawn upon and  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
to varying degrees  commitments to extend credit involve elements of credit and interest rate risk for us that are in excess of the amounts recognized in our balance sheet 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customers to whom such commitments are made is equal to the amount of those commitments 
as a result  before making such a commitment to a customer  we evaluate the customer s creditworthiness using the same underwriting standards that we would apply when deciding whether or not to approve loans to the customer 
in addition  we often require the customer to secure its payment obligations for amounts drawn on such commitments with collateral such as accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing commercial properties  residential properties or properties under construction 
a standby letter of credit is a conditional commitment issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent resources  together with available borrowings under our line of credit and credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable us to meet any increases in demand for loans and leases or in the utilization of outstanding loan commitments or standby letters of credit and any increase in deposit withdrawals that might occur in the foreseeable future 

table of contents capital resources and dividends it has been and continues to be the objective of our board of directors to retain earnings that are needed to meet capital requirements under applicable government regulations and to support the continuing growth of our banking franchise 
at the same time  it is the policy of the board of directors to pay cash dividends if earnings exceed the amounts the board deems to be necessary to meet that objective 
pursuant to that policy  we have paid regular quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders since september of and  in january of  the board of directors declared a per share cash dividend  which was the nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared since the current dividend policy was adopted 
however  in the future  the board of directors may change the amount or frequency of cash dividends to the extent that it deems necessary or appropriate to achieve our objective of maintaining capital in amounts sufficient to support our growth 
for example the retention of earnings in previous years enabled us to fund the opening of new banking offices and to extend the bank s market areas  all of which have contributed to our increased profitability and the maintenance of our capital adequacy ratios well above regulatory requirements 
we continue to evaluate and explore opportunities to expand our market into areas such as eastern los angeles county  western san bernardino county  north orange county and northern riverside county  all of which are contiguous to our existing markets 
the number of independent banks based in our market areas has declined significantly  due to a consolidation in the banking industry that occurred over the past several years 
we believe that this consolidation has created opportunities for us to increase our market share in those areas 
we have taken advantage of those opportunities by establishing a substantial number of new customer relationships and increasing the volume of our demand  savings and money market deposit balances 
we also believe that there are still additional expansion and growth opportunities that we will seek to take advantage of in the future 
stock repurchase program 
in january of the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provided for us to repurchase up to  of its common stock 
repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions when opportunities to do so at favorable prices present themselves  in compliance with securities and exchange commission sec guidelines 
as of december   we had repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock under this program for an aggregate price of approximately  regulatory capital requirements 
federal banking agencies require united states based bank holding companies on a consolidated basis and fdic insured banks on a stand alone basis to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk adjusted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier capital essentially  the sum of a bank s capital stock and retained earnings  less any intangibles to risk adjusted assets of 
in addition to the risked based guidelines  federal banking regulators require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to total average assets  which is referred to as a bank s leverage ratio 
for these purposes  subordinated indebtedness issued in connection with a sale of trust preferred securities may comprise up to of a banking organization s tier capital and  to the extent such indebtedness exceeds that limitation  such indebtedness will constitute tier capital for regulatory capital purposes 
all of the subordinated indebtedness evidenced by the junior subordinated debentures that we issued in december qualifies as tier capital under federal reserve board regulations 
the federal banking agencies have adopted uniform capital requirements for the banks that they supervise and assign each of those banks to one of the following five categories based on their respective capital ratios well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized as a general rule  banks that are categorized as well capitalized are subject to less stringent supervision by their federal regulatory agencies than are banks that are classified in one of the other categories  and at each successive lower capital category  a bank is subject to greater operating restrictions and increased regulatory supervision 
for a banking organization rated in the highest of these five categories of capital adequacy  the minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to average assets must be 
in addition to these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry  federal and state bank regulatory agencies have the discretion to set minimum capital requirements for specific banking institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios and encourage banks to maintain their ratios above those minimums as a matter of prudent banking practices 

table of contents the risk based capital ratio is determined by weighting a bank s assets in accordance with certain risk factors and  the higher the risk profile of the assets  the greater is the amount of capital that is required in order to maintain an adequate risk based capital ratio  which generally is at least set forth below are the minimum capital ratios that a bank must meet to be categorized as adequately capitalized and well capitalized  respectively  and the corresponding capital ratios of the bank at december  the bank has been categorized as a well capitalized institution by its primary federal banking agency and its tier capital and tier risk based capital ratios exceed minimum regulatory requirements and compare favorably with those of the banks and bank holding companies in its peer group 
to be categorized by a federal bank regulatory agency as foothill independent bank adequately capitalized well capitalized actual total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets leverage ratio factors that could affect our future financial performance as described earlier in this section of this report  under the subcaption forward looking statements  this report contains statements that discuss our expectations or beliefs regarding our future operations or future financial performance  or financial or other trends in our business 
these forward looking statements are based on current information and on our judgments  assumptions and forecasts about future events over which we do not have control and which  due to the possible occurrence of currently unexpected future events or changes in economic or market trends or conditions  may ultimately prove to have been incorrect 
additionally  the realization of our expected financial results or performance discussed in those forward looking statements is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial condition or operating results in the future to differ significantly from those expected at the current time 
certain of those risks and uncertainties are discussed above in the section of the report entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
in addition  included among the risks and uncertainties that could affect our future financial performance or financial condition are the following increased competition 
increased competition from other financial institutions  mutual funds and securities brokerage and investment banking firms that offer competitive loan and investment products could require us to reduce interest rates and loan fees in order to attract new loans or to increase interest rates that we offer on deposits  either or both of which could  in turn  reduce our interest income or increase our interest expense  thereby reducing our net interest margin  net interest income and net earnings 
possible adverse changes in economic conditions 
an adverse change in future economic conditions  either national or local  could i reduce loan demand that could cause our interest income and net interest margins to decline  ii weaken the financial capability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations  which could lead to increases in loan losses that would require us to increase our loan loss reserve through additional charges to income  and iii lead to declines in real property values that  due to our reliance on real property to secure many of our loans  could make it more difficult for us to prevent losses from being incurred on non performing loans through the sale of such real properties 
possible adverse changes in federal reserve board monetary policies 
changes in national economic conditions  such as increases in inflation or declines in economic output often prompt changes in federal reserve board monetary policies that could increase the cost of funds to us or reduce yields on interest earning assets 
increases in our costs of funds or reductions in yields on our earning assets could cause our net interest margins and net interest income and  therefore  also our net earnings  to decline 
as discussed above  during the three years ended in june  the federal reserve board lowered market rates of interest in an effort to stimulate the national economy 
those reductions caused our net interest margin to decline  because they led to reductions in the interest paid by borrowers on outstanding variable rate loans or enabled borrowers to refinance existing fixed rate loans at lower interest rates or to repay their loans 
although the federal reserve board recently increased interest rates and has indicated an intention to continue doing so at a gradual pace  further reductions in our net interest margin and net interest income and  therefore  in our net 
table of contents earnings  could still occur depending on the pace of those increases 
in addition  there is no assurance that economic or market conditions will not lead the federal reserve board to halt or even roll back such interest rate increases 
real estate mortgage loans 
approximately of our loans are secured by deeds of trust or mortgages on real property 
although a significant portion of these loans were made to individuals  or entities controlled by individuals  whose businesses occupy the properties and the principal source of repayment is the cash flow generated by those businesses  if a significant decline in real property values occurred in southern california  such a decline could result in a deterioration in some of those loans that would necessitate increases in our loan loss reserve and could result in loan write offs that would adversely affect our financial conditions and lead to reductions in earnings 
lack of geographic diversity of our operations 
substantially all of our banking operations are conducted in the inland empire area of southern california  within a radius of approximately miles 
as a result  our operating results in the future could be hurt by events that could affect that geographic area  including natural disasters  such as earthquakes or fires  or localized economic downturns  or by financial difficulties that might be encountered by local governments or the california state government 
changes in regulatory policies 
changes in federal and state bank regulatory policies  such as increases in capital requirements or in loan loss reserves  or changes in required asset liability ratios  could adversely affect earnings by reducing yields on earning assets or increasing our operating costs 
effects of growth 
it is our intention to take advantage of opportunities to increase our business  through acquisitions of other banks  the establishment of new banking offices or the offering of new products or services to our customers 
if we do acquire any other banks  open any additional banking offices or begin offering new products or services  we are likely to incur additional operating costs that may adversely affect our operating results  at least on an interim basis 
possible change in dividend policy or dividend payments 
in accordance with the board of directors dividend policy  we have paid a regular quarterly cash dividend since september and have made periodic repurchases of our outstanding shares 
although there are no plans to reduce the amount or terminate the payment of cash dividends  there can be no assurance that the amount or frequency of cash dividends will not have to be reduced or that cash dividends will not have to be suspended  as this will depend on such factors as economic and market conditions  our future financial performance and financial condition and our needs for capital to support future growth or meet regulatory capital requirements 
due to these and other possible uncertainties and risks  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values of assets or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price or value of financial instruments 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates and other market conditions 
market risk is attributed to all market risk sensitive financial instruments  including loans and investment securities  deposits and borrowings 
we do not engage in trading activities or participate in foreign currency transactions for our own account 
accordingly  our exposure to market risk is primarily a function of our asset and liability management activities and of changes in market rates of interest that can cause or require increases in the rates we pay on deposits that may take effect more rapidly or may be greater than the increases in the interest rates we are able to charge on loans and the yields that we can realize on our investments 
the extent of that market risk depends on a number of variables  including the sensitivity of our interest earning assets and our deposits to changes in market interest rates and the maturities 

table of contents the following table sets forth information concerning the interest rate sensitivity of our consolidated assets and liabilities as of december  assets and liabilities are classified by the earliest possible repricing date or maturity  whichever comes first 
three months or less over three through twelve months over one year through five years over five years non interest bearing total dollars in thousands assets interest bearing deposits in banks investment securities federal funds sold net loans noninterest earning assets total assets liabilities and stockholders equity noninterest bearing deposits interest bearing deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings other liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap generally  where rate sensitive assets principally loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities principally interest bearing deposits  net interest margin will be positively impacted during periods of increasing interest rates and negatively impacted during periods of decreasing interest rates 
when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  the net interest margin generally will be negatively affected during periods of increasing interest rates and positively affected during periods of decreasing interest rates 
as of december   our rate sensitive balance sheet was shown to be in a negative three month gap position because our rate sensitive liabilities exceeded our rate sensitive assets for that period 
this implies that our net interest margin would decrease in the short term if interest rates were to rise and would increase in the short term if interest rates were to fall 
however  the extent to which our net interest margin will be impacted by changes in prevailing interests rates will depend on a number of factors  including how quickly rate sensitive assets and liabilities react to changes in interest rates  which will depend on a number of factors  including the mix of interest earning assets between loans  on the one hand  and other earning assets  on the other hand  and the mix of core and time certificates of deposit and the actions we take  in terms of changing the mix of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in response to changes in the interest rate environment 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operation net interest margin  rate sensitivity and market risk we use a dynamic simulation model to forecast the anticipated impact of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income 
that model is used to assist management in evaluating  and in determining and adjusting strategies designed to reduce  our exposure to these market risks  which may include  for example  changing the mix of earning assets or interest bearing deposits 
simulated rate changes estimated net interest income sensitivity market value assets liabilities dollars in thousands basis points basis points basis points basis points as is the case with the interest rate gap analysis  this model provides a snap shot of what impact changes in interest rates would have on our net interest income  assuming all other conditions remained unchanged  and does not take into account actions that management would take in response to market trends indicating either that interest rates will be increasing or will be decreasing
