item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business outlook we took a number of steps during the fiscal year that we believe will help drive sales and earnings growth in fiscal year in fiscal year we spent considerable time and money to improve our distribution capabilities by adding a new facility in cranbury  new jersey  moving our facility from knoxville  tennessee to a more modern facility in clinton  tennessee and upgrading our other existing facilities 
we believe that these efforts will allow us to reach more customers and improve our service 
while we do not plan to add any additional facilities during the upcoming year  we will be moving the delta and soffe individual facilities located in california into one larger consolidated facility 
with this move we expect to achieve some economies of scale plus have more room for the activewear apparel products on the west coast 
we expect to complete the move to the new facility in our second fiscal quarter of we will also continue to invest in planning and marketing systems in the upcoming year to improve our inventory management and better serve our customers 
we believe we have greatly improved the product development and merchandising process at soffe  and expect these improvements to result in higher sales in the upcoming year 
we hired a new manager for our bookstore segment  and are optimistic that we will be able to grow this division in fiscal year we are adding a second soffe outlet store which will be located in selma  north carolina 
we are expecting to open this store in the second half of the upcoming year 
this will allow us to better manage our inventory by selling overruns and out of season merchandise 
at soffe  we implemented significant changes to our supply chain which should lower our cost of sales in fiscal year in april  we closed a domestic sewing facility located in bladenboro  north carolina  moving this sewing to outside contractors located in the caribbean basin 
this decision should help us remain competitive in today s marketplace 
in addition  we have implemented other cost savings programs that  along with the move of sewing to offshore  we anticipate will reduce our cost of sales by approximately million on an annual basis 
we should start seeing this improvement in our income statement in the second half of fiscal year in our activewear apparel segment  we expect to have lower raw material cost in the first half of the upcoming year than we did in the first half of fiscal year in addition  we have made significant reductions in our cost of off quality and have improved our material utilization 
these improvements should also reduce our costs in the first half of the new fiscal year 
in august we acquired the assets of liquid blaino designs  inc d b a junkfood clothing 
the junkfood business was founded seven years ago by blaine halvorson and natalie grof 
both of them will stay in their current roles with the company and will continue to direct all aspects of the business from its headquarters in los angeles  ca 
junkfood sells fashion forward vintage licensed and branded tees and other apparel products 
over the past seven years  junkfood has experienced impressive growth with its innovative designs and great sense of style 
it has strong retail relationships  licensing partners and a loyal customer following  all of which we expect will strengthen over the next several years 
the acquisition of the junkfood business is consistent with our strategy of marketing basic apparel across a wide range of distribution channels 
for the twelve months ended june   junkfood clothing had sales of approximately million 
we expect the junkfood acquisition will add approximately to million in sales and to in earnings per share for the fiscal year ending july  we will continue to make strategic investments in our textile and sewing plants to lower cost and increase our output 
through our honduran subsidiary  we are investing with experienced partners in the green valley industrial park  which will construct and operate an industrial park in san pedro sula  honduras 
this joint venture affords us opportunities in the caribbean basin  should we decide to further grow our operations in honduras 
in total  we expect to spend approximately million on capital expenditures in the upcoming year  including approximately million on our investment in green valley 
because of our increased number of brands and our larger size and scope  we have decided to commence providing sales and earnings guidance 
each quarter we plan to provide an outlook for sales and earnings for the full fiscal year and for the upcoming fiscal quarter 
for the first fiscal quarter ending on october   we expect sales to be in the range of to million and basic earnings per share to be in the range of to 
for the fiscal year ending july   we expect sales to be in the range of to million and basic earnings per share to be in the range of to 
this compares to our actual basic earnings per share of  or per share if you adjust for the sale of our edgefield plant and for the reversal of the honduras foreign earnings tax liability 
actual fy basic earnings per share sale of edgefield plant reversal of foreign earnings tax liability adjusted fy basic earnings per share the adjusted basic earnings per share  a non gaap financial measure  will not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we are presenting adjusted basic earnings per share for the fiscal year ended july  because we believe it provides a more complete understanding of our business results than could be obtained absent this disclosure 
the sale of our yarn spinning plant in edgefield  south carolina and the reversal of the foreign earnings tax liability are infrequent and unusual transactions 
we believe it is a useful tool for investors to assess the operating performance of the business without the effect of these transactions 
results of operations overview our fiscal year included weeks of operations compared to weeks of operations in our fiscal year 
despite one less week of operations  total sales for fiscal were million  an all time record for our company  and up from million in the prior year

catalog direct shipments were of sales  private label shipments were of sales  and distributor shipments were of sales 
we do not anticipate having distributor sales in the future 
sales in the retail ready apparel segment were during fiscal year  up from million for the nine months we owned the business in fiscal year we believe we lost approximately million in sales due to a shorter fiscal calendar versus the prior year 
for the full year  gross margins increased basis points to compared to in the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we increased the output in our manufacturing facilities to meet customer demand for our products 
we expect to continue increasing our manufacturing output in the first half of fiscal our product cost is decreasing in our retail ready apparel segment as we improved the cost in our textile operations and moved sewing off shore 
these cost improvements are expected to result in lower cost of sales in the second half of fiscal as this product is shipped to our customers 
in january  we completed the sale of our yarn manufacturing plant in edgefield  south carolina to parkdale america  llc for million in cash 
in conjunction with the sale transaction  we entered into a five year agreement with parkdale to supply our yarn requirements 
the sale of the edgefield plant resulted in a pre tax financial gain of million  or after tax gain of per diluted share adjusted to reflect the for stock split effective as of may  
we made considerable progress on lowering our debt during fiscal year debt was reduced by million during fiscal year  for a total debt reduction of over million since we closed on the soffe acquisition in october on august   we borrowed approximately million to pay the cash portion of the purchase price for the junkfood acquisition and to pay in full the note that we issued to the soffe sellers in connection with our acquisition of soffe in in addition  on august   we issued a million note to liquid blaino designs  inc in connection with the junkfood acquisition

gross margins as a percentage of sales are higher in the retail ready apparel segment than the activewear apparel segment due to the higher average selling prices achieved on the branded products  partially offset by higher manufacturing costs 
our gross margins may not be comparable to other companies  since some entities include costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold and we exclude a portion of them from gross margin  including them in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were million  or of net sales  an increase of million from million  or of net sales  in fiscal year the basis point increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of having the retail ready segment included for the full year in fiscal year  compared to nine months in fiscal year selling costs as a percentage of net sales are higher in the retail ready apparel segment primarily due to the additional staffing  higher commissions  royalty expense on licensed products  and increased advertising expenses associated with selling branded apparel products

during fiscal year  we determined that it was no longer probable that a tax liability might occur as a result of this tax sharing agreement 
therefore  we reversed the million tax liability that had been created at that time

fiscal year included weeks of operations compared to the weeks of operations in the prior fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were million  or of net sales  an increase of million from million  or of net sales  in fiscal year the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of the addition of the soffe business  which was included in our results for the last nine months of the fiscal year 
selling costs increased as a percentage of sales primarily as a result of the higher selling costs associated with branded apparel products 
during fiscal year we had a recovery of bad debt expense of million compared to a provision for bad debt expense of million during fiscal year the recovery of bad debt expense was due to improved accounts receivable agings 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we incurred higher bad debt expenses resulting from the slower payments from customers due to the depressed retail climate and the bankruptcy filing of a customer 
other expense for fiscal year was million  consistent with fiscal in both fiscal years  we recorded million in net losses related to cotton options 
in fiscal years and  we recorded a net loss of million and million  respectively  related to the sale or disposal of certain machinery and equipment

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the adequacy of receivable and inventory reserves  self insurance accruals and the accounting for income taxes 
note to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  title has transferred to the customer  the price is fixed and determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales are recorded net of discounts and provisions for estimated returns and allowances 
we estimate returns and allowances on an ongoing basis by considering historical and current trends 
we record these costs as a reduction to net revenue 
we estimate the net collectibility of our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon this assessment 
specifically  we analyze the aging of accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
significant changes in customer concentration or payment terms  deterioration of customer credit worthiness or weakening in economic trends could have a significant impact on the collectibility of receivables and our operating results 
inventories our inventory is carried at the lower of fifo cost or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for damaged  excess and out of style or otherwise obsolete inventory based primarily on our historical selling prices for these products and our estimated forecast of product demand for the next twelve months 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or if liquidation of the inventory is more difficult than anticipated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
self insurance our medical  prescription and dental care benefits are primarily self insured 
our self insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we develop estimates of claims incurred but not reported based upon the historical time it takes for a claim to be reported and historical claim amounts 
while the time it takes for a claim to be reported has been declining  if claims are greater than we originally estimate  or if costs increase beyond what we have anticipated  our recorded reserves may not be sufficient  and it could have a significant impact on our operating results 
income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities measured by enacted tax rates 
we have recorded deferred tax assets for certain state operating loss carryforwards and nondeductible accruals 
we established a valuation allowance related to certain of the state operating loss carryforward amounts in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets if reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on earnings forecasts in the respective tax locations 
as of july   we had operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for state tax purposes 
the valuation allowance against the operating loss carryfowards was thousand at july  these carryforwards expire at various intervals through recent accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
sfas  inventory costs 
sfas amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
 inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges and that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of converting work in process to finished goods be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised statement r  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statements of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted for annual periods beginning after june  statement r applies to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the required effective date  as well as to the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the required effective date modified prospective application 
we adopted statement r on july  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of statement r will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in march  the securities and exchange commission released sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment 
sab no 
provides the sec staff s position regarding the implementation of statement r 
sab no 
contains interpretive guidance related to the interaction between statement r and certain sec rules and regulations  as well as provides the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment transactions 
we are currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of sab no 
will have on our financial position and will be incorporating it as part of our adoption of statement r 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk sensitivity on january   in conjunction with the sale of our yarn spinning facility in edgefield  south carolina  we entered into a five year agreement with parkdale to supply our yarn requirements 
during this five year period  we will purchase from parkdale all yarn required by delta apparel and our wholly owned subsidiary  m 
j 
soffe co  for use in our manufacturing operations excluding yarns that parkdale did not manufacture as of the date of the agreement in the ordinary course of its business or due to temporary parkdale capacity restraints 
the purchase price of yarn is based upon the cost of cotton plus a fixed conversion cost 
thus  we are subject to the commodity risk of cotton prices and cotton price movements which could result in unfavorable yarn pricing for us 
we fix the cotton prices as a component of the purchase price of yarn with parkdale  pursuant to the supply agreement  in advance of the shipment of finished yarn from parkdale 
prices are set according to prevailing prices  as reported by the new york cotton exchange  at the time we elect to fix specific cotton prices 
yarn with respect to which we have fixed cotton prices at july  was valued at million  and is scheduled for delivery between july and june at july   a decline in the market price of the cotton covered by our fixed price yarn would have had a negative impact of approximately million on the value of the yarn 
we may use derivatives  including cotton option contracts  to manage our exposure to movements in commodity prices 
we do not designate our options as hedge instruments upon inception 
accordingly  we mark to market changes in the fair market value of the options as other expense income in the statements of income 
we did not own any cotton options contracts on july  interest rate sensitivity our credit agreements provide that the outstanding amounts owed shall bear interest at variable rates 
if the amount of outstanding indebtedness at july  under the revolving credit facilities had been outstanding during the entire year and the interest rate on this outstanding indebtedness were increased by basis points  our expense would have increased by approximately  or  for the fiscal year 
this compares to an increase of  or  for the fiscal year based on the outstanding indebtedness at july  the actual increase in interest expense resulting from a change in interest rates would depend on the magnitude of the increase in rates and the average principal balance outstanding
