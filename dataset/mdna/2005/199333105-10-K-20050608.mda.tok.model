item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
comments on the results of operations and financial condition below refer to our continuing operations  except in the section entitled discontinued operations 
executive overview we are a leading manufacturer and marketer of hoists  cranes  chain  conveyors  material handling systems  lift tables and component parts serving a wide variety of commercial and industrial end user markets 
our products are used to efficiently and ergonomically move  lift  position or secure objects and loads 
our products segment sells a wide variety of powered and manually operated wire rope and chain hoists  industrial crane systems  chain  hooks and attachments  actuators and rotary unions 
our solutions segment designs  manufactures  and installs application specific material handling systems and solutions for end users to improve work station and facility wide work flow 
founded in  we have grown to our current leadership position through organic growth and also as the result of the businesses we acquired between february and april we have developed our leading market position over our year history by emphasizing technological innovation  manufacturing excellence and superior after sale service 
in addition  the acquisitions significantly broadened our product lines and services and expanded our geographic reach  end user markets and customer base 
integration of the operations of the acquired businesses with our previously existing businesses is substantially complete 
ongoing integration of these businesses includes improving our productivity  further reducing our excess manufacturing capacity and extending our sales activities to the european and asian marketplaces 
we are executing those initiatives through our lean manufacturing efforts  facility rationalization program  new product development and expanded sales activities 
shareholder value will be enhanced through continued emphasis on the improvement of the fundamentals including manufacturing efficiency  cost containment  efficient capital investment  and our markets and customers 
our lean manufacturing efforts are fundamentally changing our manufacturing processes to be more responsive to customer demand and improving on time delivery and productivity 
from to under our facility rationalization program  we closed facilities and consolidated several product lines  with potential opportunity for further rationalization 
also  we have been undergoing assessments for possible divestiture of several less strategic busineses 
our manipulator and specialty marine chain businesses were sold in fiscal and two others remain as possible divestiture candidates  our conveyor business which comprises a majority of our solutions segment and a specialty crane business within our products segment 
in furtherance of our facility rationalization projects  in january we completed the sale of a chicago area property resulting in a million gain  which was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal in february  we announced the sale and partial leaseback of our corporate headquarters building in amherst  new york at a million gain  of which was also recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the remainder will be deferred and recognized pro rate over the life of the year leaseback period 
additionally  we sold a virginia property in the fiscal fourth quarter  and recognized a million gain 
we will continue to sell surplus real estate resulting from our facility rationalization projects and those sales may result in gains or losses 
to broaden our product offering in markets where we have a strong competitive position as well as to facilitate penetration into new geographic markets  we have heightened our new product development activities 
this includes development of hoist lines in accordance with international standards  to complement our current offering of hoist products designed in accordance with us standards 
to further expand our global sales  we are introducing certain of our products that historically have been distributed only in north america and also introducing new products through our existing european distribution network 
furthermore  we are working to build a distribution network in china to capture an anticipated growing demand for material handling products as that economy continues to industrialize 
many of the us industrial sectors that we serve have been impacted by soft economic conditions since mid these conditions deteriorated significantly in our fiscal fourth quarter and continued to decline throughout fiscal and  negatively impacting our net sales and financial performance 
we began to see some stabilization and then very modest improvement in the latter half of fiscal and significant improvement in fiscal our net sales dropped by to million in fiscal and by an additional to million in fiscal  primarily due to this downturn in the business cycle 
however  our fiscal sales improved by to million in fiscal as the company experienced definitive economic improvement 
we monitor such indicators as us industrial capacity utilization and industrial production  which have been increasing since july further  we continue to monitor the potential impact of negative global and domestic trends  including steel price fluctuations  possibly rising interest rates and uncertainty in some end user markets around the globe 
in addition  to enhance future revenue opportunities  we are increasing our sales and marketing efforts in international markets and investing in new products and services as further described in item of this annual report within the section described as our strategy 
consistent with most companies  over the past several years we have been facing significantly increased costs for fringe benefits such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance and pension 
combined  those benefits cost us over million in fiscal and we work diligently to balance cost control with the need to provide competitive employee benefits packages for our associates 
another cost area of focus is steel 
we utilize approximately million to million of steel annually in a variety of forms including rod  wire  bar  structural and others 
with increases in worldwide demand for steel and significant increases in scrap steel prices over the past year  we experienced increases in our costs that we have reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers 
our surcharges for certain products went into effect beginning in march and currently affect most of our chain and forged attachment products 
we continue to monitor steel costs and potential surcharge requirements on a monthly basis 
costs of implementing sarbanes oxley internal control documentation and compliance have also had an impact on fiscal profitability 
we are focused on minimizing the future added costs of compliance 
on the whole  we are encouraged based on current visibility  remaining cautiously optimistic for steady revenue growth to continue over the next year 
results of operations net sales of our products and solutions segments  in millions of dollars and with percentage changes for each segment  were as follows change change fiscal years ended march  vs 
vs 
amount amount products segment solutions segment total net sales sales in fiscal increased as a result of the improved economy in the industrial sector of north america compared to the downturn in the general north american and european economies and the industrial sectors in particular in fiscal and net sales in fiscal of million increased by million  or  from fiscal  and net sales in fiscal of million decreased million  or  from fiscal the products segment for fiscal experienced a net sales increase of over the prior year 
the increase was due to a combination of higher volume as the north american industrial economy recovered as well as price increases million including surcharges specifically in response to rising steel costs 
our products segment net sales improved in fiscal as we saw stabilization by mid and improvement of in the latter half of the fiscal year 
both fiscal and were impacted by the weakening us dollar relative to other currencies  particularly the euro  and reported products segment sales were favorably affected by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
for fiscal  our solutions segment net sales increased as a result of increased volume in europe at our conveyor business 
our solutions segment net sales decreased in fiscal the decline in fiscal was primarily due to soft us and european industrial markets  particularly affecting purchasing decisions for capital goods 
the fiscal decline was further impacted by the march divestiture of our steel erection business  which generated million of revenues in fiscal gross profit of the products and solutions segments  in millions of dollars and as a percentage of total segment net sales  was as follows fiscal years ended march  amount amount amount products segment solutions segment total gross profit our gross profit margins were approximately  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the products segment saw improved gross margin in fiscal as a result of operational leverage at increased volumes from the prior year 
gross margin for the products segment in fiscal was comparable to fiscal as revenue stabilized during the fiscal year and costs were closely monitored 
the solutions segment s gross profit margins increased in fiscal as a result of the recovery of european markets which led to increased volume for one division  as well as the divestiture of a poor performing  non strategic business at the end of fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to was primarily due to an increase in larger integrated solutions projects which carry a lower gross profit margin overall and a poor performing non strategic business unit which was divested in february of selling expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal and increases include million and million  respectively  resulting from the weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies  particularly the euro  upon translation of foreign operating results into us dollars for reporting purposes 
fiscal includes increases related to variable costs associated with the increase sales volume  mainly commissions million  increased benefit costs million and increased investments in international markets million 
the fiscal increase also includes million resulting from reclassification of certain crane builder expenses from general and administrative expenses in fiscal to improve reporting consistency 
these increases were partially offset by cost control measures 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal increases include million associated with variable compensation  million related to compliance costs associated with sarbanes oxley section implementation  million of increasing benefit costs  million resulting from the translation of foreign currencies into the weaker us dollar for reporting purposes and million for an increase in bad debt reserves based on increased accounts receivable levels 
much of the fiscal expense reductions resulted from general discretionary cost control measures 
partially offsetting those savings  fiscal was unfavorably impacted by million resulting from the translation of foreign currencies into the weaker us dollar for reporting purposes and also included million for an increase in bad debt reserves based on increased accounts receivable levels 
restructuring charges of million  million and million  or  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively  were primarily attributable to the closure or significant reorganization of thirteen manufacturing or warehouse facilities 
the fiscal restructuring charges of million relate primarily to facility costs as a result of our continued closure  merging and reorganization 
million of the costs relate to facility costs being expensed on an as incurred basis as a result of the project timing being subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
the current year charge also included million of write down on the net realizable value of a facility based on changes in market conditions and a reassessment of its net realizable value 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to various employee termination benefits and facility costs as a result of our continued closure  merging and reorganization and completion of two open projects from fiscal the following facilities were closed  merged or significantly reorganized beginning in fiscal abingdon  va  tonawanda  ny  cobourg  ontario  canada  forest park  il  and reform  al 
excluding the tonawanda facility  these operations were included within our products segment  and were relocated into other existing products segment facilities 
fiscal charges included exit costs of million for severance relating to approximately employees  million of lease termination  facility wind down  preparation for sale and maintenance of non operating facilities prior to disposal and million for facility closure costs on projects begun in three of the five projects were completed as planned in the fourth quarter of fiscal while the other two were completed as planned by the second quarter of fiscal the remaining liability of million as of march  relates to the ongoing maintenance costs of a non operating facility 
each rationalization project was analyzed based on our capacity and the cost structure of the specific facilities relative to others 
as a result of these rationalization projects we expect to achieve approximately million to million of annualized savings primarily in cost of products sold including facility fixed costs and employee costs  of which approximately million and million was realized during fiscal and  respectively 
write off amortization of intangibles was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal reflected a million goodwill write off in the fourth quarter relating to impairment under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which pronouncement eliminated the requirement to amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets beginning in fiscal but added new impairment testing rules 
interest and debt expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  interest and debt expense was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal and decreases primarily resulted from lower debt levels 
other income was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal includes million in gains from sales of real estate  million from investment and interest income  offset by million of additional losses from business divestitures 
the income in fiscal included million from asset sales and million from an interest rate swap partially offset by million of losses upon business divestitures 
the income in fiscal included million from asset sales offset by a million unrealized  non cash  mark to market loss recognized within our captive insurance company s securities portfolio and a million loss on a business divestiture 
the fiscal unrealized loss within the securities portfolio was recognized since it was deemed to be other than temporary in nature  resulting from unrealized losses that existed longer than a six month period 
income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes were not reflective of u 
s statutory rates in fiscal  or the fiscal rate varies due to the benefit received from the utilization of the domestic net operating loss carry forwards that have been fully reserved and jurisdictional mix 
income tax expense primarily results from non us taxable income and state taxes on us taxable income 
the fiscal rate varies due to jurisdictional mix and the existence of losses at certain subsidiaries for which no benefit was recorded 
the fiscal rate was affected by the impact of non deductible goodwill amortization write off 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we reduced goodwill by million as of the beginning of fiscal  reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on our statement of operations 
a discounted cash flows approach was used to test goodwill for potential impairment 
liquidity and capital resources on november   the company refinanced its credit facilities 
the arrangement consisted of a revolving credit facility  a term loan  and a senior second secured term loan 
the senior second secured term loan was refinanced as described below 
on april   the company amended its credit facilities 
as a result of the amendment  the term loan was repaid in its entirety 
the revolving credit facility was amended to provide availability up to a maximum of million 
prior to the amendment  the revolving credit facility provided availability up to a maximum of million 
availability based on the underlying collateral at march  amounted to million 
the unused revolving credit facility totaled million  net of outstanding borrowings of million and outstanding letters of credit of million 
interest on the revolver is payable at varying eurodollar rates based on libor or prime plus a spread determined by the company s leverage ratio amounting to or basis points  respectively  at march   effective april   the amended credit facility would have interest payable at varying eurodollar rates based on libor or prime plus a spread determined by the company s leverage ratio amounting to or basis points  respectively  at march  the revolving credit facility is secured by all domestic inventory  receivables  equipment  real property  subsidiary stock limited to for foreign subsidiaries and intellectual property 
in july  we issued million of senior secured notes due august  which remain outstanding at march  proceeds from this offering were used for the repayment in full of a then outstanding senior second secured term loan million  the repurchase of million of senior subordinated notes at a discount million  the repayment of a portion of the outstanding revolving credit facility million  the repayment of a portion of the term loan million  the payment of financing costs million and the payment of accrued interest million 
provisions of the notes include  without limitation  restrictions on liens  indebtedness  asset sales  and dividends and other restricted payments 
the notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at prices declining annually from the make whole price as defined in the indenture for the notes 
in the event of a change of control as defined  each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof 
the notes are guaranteed by certain existing and future domestic subsidiaries and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
the notes are also secured  in a second lien position  by all domestic inventory  receivables  equipment  real property  subsidiary stock limited to for foreign subsidiaries and intellectual property 
the redemption of a portion of the outstanding senior subordinated notes occurred at a discount resulting in a million pre tax gain on early extinguishment of debt 
as a result of the repayment of the senior second secured term loan and a portion of the term loan and senior subordinated notes  million of pre tax deferred financing costs were written off in fiscal the net effect of these two items  a million pre tax gain  is shown as part of other income and expense  net 
the corresponding credit agreement associated with the revolving credit facility places certain debt covenant restrictions on us  including financial requirements and a restriction on dividend payments  with which we are currently in compliance 
at march   our senior subordinated notes issued on march  and due march  amounted to million  net of original issue discount 
interest is payable semi annually based on an effective rate of  considering million of proceeds from rate hedging in advance of the placement 
provisions of the notes include  without limitation  restrictions on liens  indebtedness  asset sales and dividends and other restricted payments 
prior to april   the notes were redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at the make whole price as defined in the indenture for the notes 
on or after april   they are redeemable at prices declining annually from to on and after april  in the event of a change of control as defined  each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof 
the notes are guaranteed by certain existing and future domestic subsidiaries and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
from time to time  we manage our debt portfolio by using interest rate swaps to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates 
in june  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt  which matured in june that cash flow hedge was considered effective and the gain or loss on the change in fair value was reported in other comprehensive income  net of tax 
in august  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt libor plus basis points through august and million from august through august at the same rate 
that interest rate swap was considered an ineffective hedge and therefore the change in fair value was recognized in income as a gain 
the swap was terminated in january and a pre tax gain of million was recognized in fiscal as other income  net as a result of changes in the fair value of the swap 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash flows  and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and budgeted capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
this belief is dependent upon a steady economy and successful execution of our current business plan which is focused on cash generation for debt repayment 
the business plan includes continued implementation of lean manufacturing  facility rationalization projects  divestiture of excess facilities and certain non strategic operations  improving working capital components  including inventory reductions  and new market and new product development 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
overall  operating assets net of liabilities used cash of million in fiscal compared to providing cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the million decrease in fiscal relative to fiscal was primarily due to stronger operating performance in fiscal offset by increased working capital requirements 
the million increase in fiscal relative to fiscal was primarily due to stronger operating performance in fiscal and income tax refunds of million 
net cash provided by investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal  and amounts included million  million and million  respectively  from business and property divestitures 
net cash used in financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
those amounts included million  million and million of debt repayment in fiscal  and  respectively 
we also paid million and million of financing costs in fiscal and  respectively  to effect the capital transactions previously described 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations in millions of dollars as of march   by period of estimated payments due fiscal fiscal fiscal more than total fiscal fiscal five years long term debt obligations a 
operating lease obligations b purchase obligations c interest obligations d letter of credit obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap e 
total a as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
b as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
c we have no purchase obligations specifying fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased 
we estimate that  at any given point in time  our open purchase orders to be executed in the normal course of business approximate million 
d estimated for our senior secured notes due and senior subordinated notes due e as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have no additional off balance sheet obligations that are not reflected above 
capital expenditures in addition to keeping our current equipment and plants properly maintained  we are committed to replacing  enhancing and upgrading our property  plant and equipment to support new product development  reduce production costs  increase flexibility to respond effectively to market fluctuations and changes  meet environmental requirements  enhance safety and promote ergonomically correct work stations 
further  our facility rationalization program underway over the past four years reduced our annual capital expenditure requirements and also provided for transfers of equipment from the rationalized facilities to other operating facilities 
our capital expenditures for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the decreased in fiscal reflects a deferral of certain projects due to soft market conditions  as well as reduced needs resulting from our facility rationalization program 
we expect capital expenditure spending in fiscal to be consistent with fiscal at million 
inflation and other market conditions our costs are affected by inflation in the us economy and  to a lesser extent  in foreign economies including those of europe  canada  mexico and the pacific rim 
we do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases and surcharges 
however  employee benefits costs such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance  pensions as well as energy and business insurance have exceeded general inflation levels 
in the future  we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we were impacted by high inflation in steel costs which varied by type of steel 
we generally incorporated those cost increases into our sales price increases throughout fiscal as well as surcharges on certain products that began in march we continue to monitor steel costs and potential surcharge requirements on a monthly basis 
seasonality and quarterly results our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders  periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations  restructuring charges and other costs attributable to our facility rationalization program  divestitures  acquisitions and the magnitude of rationalization integration costs 
therefore  our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year 
discontinued operations in may  we completed the divestiture of substantially all of the assets of asi which comprised the principal business unit in our former solutions automotive segment 
proceeds from this sale included cash of million and an subordinated note in the principal amount of million payable over years 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial viability of the new organization  the note has been recorded at the estimated net realizable value of principal payments received on the note are recorded as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt 
accordingly  million of income from discontinued operations was recorded in fiscal all interest and principal payments required under the note have been made to date 
cash provided by discontinued operations was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  as shown on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates 
we have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements 
other accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are disclosed in notes and  respectively  to our fiscal consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs 
the pension discount rate assumptions of  and as of march   and  respectively  are based on long term bond rates 
the decrease in discount rates for fiscal and resulted in million and million increases in the projected benefit obligations as of march  and  respectively 
the rate of return on plan assets assumptions of  and for the years ended march   and  respectively  are based on the composition of the asset portfolios approximately equities and fixed income at march  and their long term historical returns 
the actual assets realized gains of and million in fiscal and our funded status as of march  and was negative by million and million  or and  respectively 
our pension contributions during fiscal and were approximately million 
the negative funded status may result in future pension expense increases 
pension expense for the march  fiscal year is expected to approximate million  which is down from the fiscal amount of million 
during fiscal  we incurred a one time pre tax charge of million related to a defined benefit pension plan at one of our foreign operations for a change in the discount rate used in determining the amount required for us gaap purposes 
the factors outlined above will result in increases in funding requirements over time  unless there is continued significant market appreciation in the asset values 
however  pension funding contributions for the march  fiscal year are expected to decrease by approximately million compared to fiscal the compensation increase assumption of as of march   and is based on historical trends 
the healthcare inflation assumptions of  and for fiscal  and  respectively are based on anticipated trends 
healthcare costs in the united states have increased substantially over the last several years 
if this trend continues  the cost of postretirement healthcare will increase in future years 
insurance reserves 
our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in note to our consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims  and assumptions including emergence patterns  payment patterns  initial expected losses and increased limit factors 
other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained 
inventory and accounts receivable reserves 
slow moving and obsolete inventory reserves are judgmentally determined based on historical and expected future usage within a reasonable timeframe 
we reassess trends and usage on a regular basis and if we identify changes we revise our estimated allowances 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on historical bad debt write offs and credit memos issued  assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts and analyzing the accounts receivable agings 
long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives 
these assets as well as goodwill are also periodically measured for impairment 
the assigned lives and the projected cash flows used to test impairment are subjective 
if actual lives are shorter than anticipated or if future cash flows are less than anticipated  we could incur a future impairment charge or a loss on disposal relating to these assets 
marketable securities 
on a quarterly basis  we review our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other than temporary 
we consider market value declines to be other than temporary if they are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of of original cost 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
as of march   the company had million of total net deferred tax assets before valuation allowances 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  million of the assets pertain to net operating loss carryforwards and the remainder relate principally to liabilities including employee benefit plans  insurance reserves  accrued vacation and incentive costs and also to asset valuation reserves such as inventory obsolescence reserves and bad debt reserves 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire in a valuation allowance of million was recorded at march  due to the uncertainty of whether the company s net operating loss carryforwards  capital loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized 
our ability to realize our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income 
if we do not generate sufficient taxable income  we would record an additional valuation allowance 
revenue recognition 
sales are recorded when title passes to the customer  which is generally at the time of shipment to the customer  except for long term construction contracts 
for long term construction contracts  we recognize contract revenues under the percentage of completion method  measured by comparing direct costs incurred to total estimated direct costs 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from final contract settlements  may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
in the event that a loss is anticipated on an uncompleted contract  a provision for the estimated loss is made at the time it is determined 
billings on contracts may precede or lag revenues earned  and such differences are reported in the balance sheet as current liabilities accrued liabilities and current assets unbilled revenues  respectively 
customers do not routinely return product 
however  sales returns are permitted in specific situations and typically include a restocking charge or the purchase of additional product 
we have established an allowance for returns based upon historical trends 
effects of new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  as an amendment to arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage 
this statement requires that these items be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement becomes effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r was to be adopted for interim or annual periods beginning after june  on april th   the sec announced that it would provide for a phased in implementation process for fasb statement no 
r 
the sec is requiring that registrants adopt statement r s fair value method of accounting for share based payments to employees no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  we expect to adopt r in the first quarter of fiscal statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company is still evaluating the method it plans to use when it adopts statement r 
as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  adoption of statement r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
factors affecting our operating results our business is cyclical and is affected by industrial economic conditions  and over the past several years we experienced substantially reduced demand for our products 
many of the end users of our products are in highly cyclical industries  such as general manufacturing and construction  that are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions 
their demand for our products  and thus our results of operations  is directly related to the level of production in their facilities  which changes as a result of changes in general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control 
in fiscal and  for example  we experienced significantly reduced demand for our products  generally as a result of the global economic slowdown  and more specifically as a result of the dramatic decline in capital goods spending in the industries in which our end users operate 
these lower levels of demand resulted in a decline in net sales from fiscal to fiscal  from million to million 
this decline in net sales resulted in a decrease in our income from operations during the same period 
we have seen a significant improvement in demand for our products in fiscal our net sales for fiscal were million  up million or from fiscal sales 
if the current upturn does not continue or if there is deterioration in the general economy or in the industries we serve  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the cyclical nature of our business could at times also adversely affect our liquidity and ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility 
we rely in large part on independent distributors for sales of our products 
we depend on independent distributors to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers 
distributors play a significant role in determining which of our products are stocked at the branch locations  and hence are most readily accessible to aftermarket buyers  and the price at which these products are sold 
almost all of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our customers 
we do not have written agreements with our distributors located in the united states 
the loss of a substantial number of these distributors or an increase in the distributors sales of our competitors products to our ultimate customers could materially reduce our sales and profits 
we are subject to currency fluctuations from our international sales 
our products are sold in many countries around the world 
thus  a portion of our revenues approximately million in fiscal year is generated in foreign currencies  including principally the euro and the canadian dollar  while a portion of the costs incurred to generate those revenues are incurred in other currencies 
since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars  changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had  and will continue to have  an impact on our earnings 
we currently do not have exchange rate hedges in place to reduce the risk of an adverse currency exchange movement 
currency fluctuations may impact our financial performance in the future 
our international operations pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings 
we have operations and assets located outside of the united states  primarily in canada  mexico  germany  the united kingdom  denmark  france and china 
in addition  we import a portion of our hoist product line from asia  and sell our products to distributors located in approximately countries 
in fiscal year  approximately of our net sales were derived from non us markets 
these international operations are subject to a number of special risks  in addition to the risks of our domestic business  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  differing protections of intellectual property  trade barriers  labor unrest  exchange controls  regional economic uncertainty  differing and possibly more stringent labor regulation  risk of governmental expropriation  domestic and foreign customs and tariffs  current and changing regulatory environments  difficulty in obtaining distribution support  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differences in the availability and terms of financing  political instability and risks of increases in taxes 
also  in some foreign jurisdictions we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met 
these factors may adversely affect our future profits 
part of our strategy is to expand our worldwide market share and reduce costs by strengthening our international distribution capabilities and sourcing basic components in foreign countries  in particular in mexico and china 
implementation of this strategy may increase the impact of the risks described above  and we cannot assure you that such risks will not have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our business is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce our sales  earnings and profitability 
the principal markets that we serve within the material handling industry are fragmented and highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on performance  functionality  price  brand recognition  customer service and support  and product availability 
our competition in the markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes  some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional services at a higher cost to us  which could reduce our gross margins and net income 
the greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions 
certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product or service innovations that could put us at a disadvantage 
in addition  some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate  including crane building 
if we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers of material handling equipment  we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 
there can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably  that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers  that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets 
our products involve risks of personal injury and property damage  which exposes us to potential liability 
our business exposes us to possible claims for personal injury or death and property damage resulting from the products that we sell 
we maintain insurance through a combination of self insurance retentions and excess insurance coverage 
we monitor claims and potential claims of which we become aware and establish accrued liability reserves for the self insurance amounts based on our liability estimates for such claims 
we cannot give any assurance that existing or future claims will not exceed our estimates for self insurance or the amount of our excess insurance coverage 
in addition  we cannot give any assurance that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or that our insurers would not require us to increase our self insurance amounts 
claims brought against us that are not covered by insurance or that result in recoveries in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition 
our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in steel prices 
we may not be able to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers 
the principal raw material used in our chain  forging and crane building operations is steel 
the steel industry as a whole is highly cyclical  and at times pricing can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control  including general economic conditions  labor costs  competition  import duties  tariffs and currency exchange rates 
recently  the market price of steel has increased significantly 
this volatility can significantly affect our raw material costs 
in an environment of increasing raw material prices  competitive conditions will determine how much of the steel price increases we can pass on to our customers 
presently  we have been able to add a surcharge to the costs of our high steel content products reflecting the increased cost of steel 
in the future  to the extent we are unable to pass on any steel price increases to our customers  our profitability could be adversely affected 
we depend on our senior management team and the loss of any member could adversely affect our operations 
our success is dependent on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team 
the loss of any of these individuals or an inability to attract  retain and maintain additional personnel could prevent us from implementing our business strategy 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed 
we have not entered into employment agreements with any of our senior management personnel 
we are subject to various environmental laws which may require us to expend significant capital and incur substantial cost 
our operations and facilities are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign requirements relating to the protection of the environment  including those governing the discharges of pollutants in the air and water  the generation  management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites 
we have made  and will continue to make  expenditures to comply with such requirements 
violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws and regulations  or changes in such laws and regulations such as the imposition of more stringent standards for discharges into the environment  could result in substantial costs to us  including operating costs and capital expenditures  fines and civil and criminal sanctions  third party claims for property damage or personal injury  clean up costs or costs relating to the temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations 
certain of our facilities have been in operation for many years  and we have remediated contamination at some of our facilities 
over time  we and other predecessor operators of such facilities have generated  used  handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes 
additional environmental liabilities could exist  including clean up obligations at these locations or other sites at which materials from our operations were disposed  which could result in substantial future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could reduce our profits or have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
we are exposed to various market risks  including commodity prices for raw materials  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we may enter into financial instrument transactions  which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of such changes 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel 
we control this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of our products 
we also evaluate our steel cost increases and assess the need for price increases and surcharges to our customers 
we have not entered into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs 
in fiscal  of our net sales were from manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions 
we manufacture our products in the united states  mexico  china  denmark  the united kingdom  france and germany and sell our products and solutions in over countries 
our results of operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  european currencies and the mexican peso 
for example  when the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar  the value of our net sales and net income denominated in canadian dollars decreases when translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated results 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
our foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of our foreign operations net sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency so therefore a significant change in foreign exchange rates would likely have a very minor impact on net income 
for example  a decline in the rate of exchange between the euro and the us dollar impacts net income by approximately million 
in addition  the majority of our export sale transactions are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we currently have not invested in derivative instruments  such as foreign exchange contracts  to hedge foreign currency transactions 
we control risk related to changes in interest rates by structuring our debt instruments with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates and by periodically entering into financial instrument transactions as appropriate 
at march   we do not have any material swap agreements or similar financial instruments in place 
at march  and  approximately and  respectively  of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates 
at those dates  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of outstanding variable rate debt 
a fluctuation in interest rates in fiscal and would have changed interest expense on that outstanding variable rate debt by approximately million for both years 
like many industrial manufacturers  the company is involved in asbestos related litigation 
in continually evaluating its estimated asbestos related liability  the company reviews  among other things  the incidence of past and recent claims  the historical case dismissal rate  the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs  its recent and historical resolution of the cases  the number of cases pending against it  the status and results of broad based settlement discussions  and the number of years such activity might continue 
based on this review  the company has estimated its share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos related personal injury claims 
this estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability 
the company will continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable 
based on actuarial information  the company has estimated its asbestos related aggregate liability through march  and march  to range between  and  the company s estimation of its asbestos related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable is through march  and ranges from  to  as of march  the range of probable and estimable liability reflects uncertainty in the number of future claims that will be filed and the cost to resolve those claims  which may be influenced by a number of factors  including the outcome of the ongoing broad based settlement negotiations  defensive strategies  and the cost to resolve claims outside the broad based settlement program 
based on the underlying actuarial information  the company has reflected  as a liability in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the increase in the recorded liability from the amount of  at march  is due to a change in actuarial parameters used to calculate required asbestos liability reserve levels 
the recorded liability does not consider the impact of any potential favorable federal legislation such as the fair act 
of this amount  management expects to incur asbestos liability payments of approximately over the next months 
because payment of the liability is likely to extend over many years  management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material after tax effect on the financial condition of the company or its liquidity  although the net after tax effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period
