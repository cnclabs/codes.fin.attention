item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of computer sciences corporation csc or the company 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended april  there are three primary objectives of this discussion to provide a narrative explanation of the consolidated financial statements  as presented through the eyes of management  to enhance the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes  providing context within which the consolidated financial statements should be analyzed  and to provide information to assist the reader in ascertaining the predictive value of the reported financial results 
to achieve these objectives  the discussion is presented in the following sections overview includes a brief description of the business and how it earns revenue and generates cash  as well as a discussion of the key business drivers  economic and industry factors  fiscal highlights and fiscal commentary 
results of operations discusses year over year changes to operating results for fiscal to  describing the factors affecting revenue on a consolidated and reporting segment basis  including new contracts  acquisitions and currency impacts  and also by describing the factors affecting changes in the major cost and expense categories 
financial condition discusses causes of changes in cash flows and describes the company s liquidity position and available capital resources 
critical accounting estimates discusses accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates 
forward looking statements and risk factors that may affect future results describes the nature of forward looking statements and lists several factors that may affect future results 
overview the company s primary service offerings are outsourcing and i t and professional services 
outsourcing activities include operating all or a portion of a customer s technology infrastructure and applications  and business process outsourcing 
i t and professional services include systems integration  consulting and other professional services and software systems sales and related services 
csc provides these services to customers in the global commercial and us federal government markets 
on a geographic basis  csc provides services to global commercial customers in the united states  europe and other international locations 
operations in australia  asia and canada generate substantially all revenue within other international 
economic and industry factors global commercial markets are affected by various economic and industry factors 
the economic environment in the regions csc serves will impact customers decisions for discretionary spending on i t projects 
csc is in a highly competitive industry which pressures pricing and requires companies to continually seek ways to differentiate themselves through several factors  including service offerings and flexibility 
management monitors industry factors including relative market shares  growth rates  billing rates  staff utilization rates and margins as well as macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates  inflation rates and foreign currency rates 
the us federal market is also highly competitive and has unique characteristics 
all us government contracts and subcontracts may be modified  curtailed or terminated at the convenience of the government if program requirements or budgetary constraints change 
in the event that a contract is terminated for convenience  the company generally is reimbursed for its allowable costs through the date of termination and is paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work performed 
shifting priorities of the us government can also impact the future of projects 
the company recognized the us government s increased priorities on defense and homeland security programs and has focused business development efforts in these areas 
management monitors government priorities and industry factors through numerous industry and government publications and forecasts  legislative activity  budgeting and appropriation processes and by participating in industry professional associations 
business drivers revenue is generated by providing services on a variety of contract vehicles lasting from less than six months to years or more 
factors affecting revenue include the company s ability to successfully bid on and win new contract awards  the ability to satisfy existing customers and obtain add on business and win contract re competes  the ability to compete on price  services offered  technical ability  experience and flexibility  the ability to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions and leverage them to generate new revenues  the ability to successfully identify and divest non core operations which may impact revenue in the short term but provide resources to pursue longer term growth opportunities  and for international business  currency fluctuations 
earnings are driven by the above revenue factors  in addition to the following the ability to control costs  particularly labor costs  subcontractor expenses and overhead costs including healthcare  pension and general and administrative costs  the ability to anticipate headcount needs to avoid staff shortages or excesses  and the ability to accurately estimate various factors incorporated in contract bids and proposals 
cash flows are impacted by the above earnings  in addition to other factors including the following timely management of receivables and payables  investment opportunities available  particularly related to business acquisitions and dispositions and large outsourcing contracts  and the ability to efficiently manage capital including debt and equity instruments 
key performance indicators the company manages and assesses the performance of its business through various means  with the primary financial measures including new contract wins  revenue growth  margins  cash flow and return on investment 
new contract wins in addition to being a primary driver of future revenue  focusing on new contract wins also provides management an assessment of the company s ability to compete 
the total level of wins tends to fluctuate from year to year depending on the timing of new and recompeted contracts as well as numerous external factors 
csc employs stringent financial and operational reviews and discipline in the new contract process to evaluate risks and generate appropriate margins and returns from new contracts 
revenue growth year over year revenues tend to vary less than new contract wins  and reflect performance on both new and existing contracts 
with a wide array of services offered  the company is able to pursue additional work from existing customers 
in addition  incremental increases in revenue will not necessarily result in linear increases in costs  particularly overhead and other indirect costs  thus potentially improving profit margins 
foreign currency fluctuations also impact revenue growth 
margins margins reflect the company s performance on contracts and ability to control costs 
while the ratios of various cost elements as a percentage of revenue can shift as a result of acquisitions or dispositions of business with different cost profiles  as with the impact of the march dyncorp acquisition  a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved efficiencies and profitability 
although the majority of the company s costs are denominated in the same currency as revenues  increased use of off shore support also exposes csc to additional margin fluctuations 
cash flow a primary driver affecting csc s cash flow is the ability to manage receivables and payables 
thus  a review of the receivables measurement of days sales outstanding dso supports an ongoing focus on timely collections 
the company also regularly reviews the us generally accepted accounting principles gaap cash flow measurements of operating  investing and financing cash flows 
return on investment roi roi is an effective indicator combining a focus on margins with efficient and productive net asset utilization 
a combination of strong margins measures how efficiently profit is generated from revenue and investment base turnover measures how effectively revenue is generated from investors capital is required to generate sufficient returns on capital 
in addition  the timing of cash flows impacts roi  so that large  up front investments particularly on new outsourcing contracts require higher margins in order to generate adequate roi 
readers should be cautioned that dso  free cash flow and roi are not gaap measures  and that the company s definition of such measures may differ from other companies 
therefore  such measures may not be comparable to other companies 
csc calculates dso as follows total receivables at quarter end divided by revenue per day 
revenue per day equals total revenues for the quarter divided by the number of days in the fiscal quarter 
free cash flow is equal to the sum of operating and investing cash flows  excluding acquisitions and dispositions and purchases or sales of available for sale securities 
roi is calculated by multiplying profit margin times investment base turnover 
the profit margin used is profit before interest and special items and after tax divided by revenues 
investment base turnover equals revenues divided by average debt and equity 
fiscal highlights a significant event during fiscal was the february divestiture of the company s dyncorp international and dynmarine units and selected dyncorp technical services contracts referred to collectively as dyncorp international or di 
the di operations were purchased with dyncorp in march all results reported here classify these operations as discontinued operations 
also  the company exchanged its health plans solutions business for shares of csc stock in april these operations also are classified as discontinued operations in this report 
the dyncorp international divestiture resulted in an after tax gain of million on million of proceeds  consisting of million of cash and million of paid in kind preferred stock  reported in fiscal additional gain is expected to be realized in fiscal from working capital adjustment consideration expected to be received  which will increase the gain 
net income from the di operations for the year was million  an increase of from fiscal  notwithstanding fiscal s partial year results 
revenue for the partial year of discontinued di operations was  million  up from fiscal health plans solutions realized net income of million for fiscal versus million for fiscal revenues were million versus million for fiscal versus fiscal  respectively 
as the results of operations of di and health plan solutions are reported as discontinued operations  all revenue commentary  unless otherwise noted  refers to continuing operations only 
continuing operations highlights for the year included revenues rose  approximately before currency fluctuations 
net income grew 
continuing earnings per share were up  before special items 
contract awards of billion were announced  a record for csc  with new global commercial awards totaling billion and new us federal awards of billion 
cash flows from operating activities generated billion versus billion in fiscal  investing activities used cash of 
billion billion before disposition proceeds of 
billion versus billion in the prior year  and free cash flow grew to million  up from million in fiscal dso improved to days at year end  down from days at the end of the prior year 
debt to total capitalization ratio was at year end  improved from a year earlier  results that include the impact of billion in debt retirement 
roi for the year on total operations was flat compared with the prior year 
the company s level of announced new business awards was the highest in csc s history 
significant wins included the following global commercial general dynamics billion  ascension health billion  zurich financial services billion  textron incorporated billion  aon million  sun microsystems million  and renault million 
us federal us navy seaport enhanced million  us navy s atlantic undersea test and evaluation center million  federal aviation administration million  us strategic command million  us army aviation and missile command million  and us patent and trademark office million 
these multi year awards represent the estimated value at contract signing 
however  they cannot be considered firm orders due to their variable attributes  including demand driven usage  modifications in scope of work due to changing customer requirements  annual funding constraints and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity characteristics of major portions of the company s us federal activities 
revenue growth in the global commercial sector was the result of recent years significant contract wins  particularly in europe 
us federal sector wins have also been strong  but for fiscal their revenue impact was offset by the completion  reduced scope or de consolidation of a small number of significant programs 
currency shifts during the year also favorably impacted revenue 
the company s growth has created a broad  long term global revenue base across numerous customers  industries  geographic regions and service offerings 
approximately of csc s revenues come from long term contracts including global commercial outsourcing and us federal government engagements 
an increase in cash flow from operations during fiscal reduced the company s use of commercial paper during the year 
this reduction in commercial paper coupled with the redemption of billion of term debt during fiscal significantly reduced the debt to total capitalization ratio at year end 
the increase in cash flow from operations was driven by higher earnings during fiscal as well as an increase in non cash expenses and deferred revenue 
fiscal commentary as a top ten contractor and i t service provider to the us federal government  csc s us federal sector is well positioned to benefit from anticipated growing demand 
the us federal government is one of the world s largest i t services consumers  and its spending is expected to continue to increase during the upcoming year in order to improve technologies in the areas of defense  homeland security and civil agency modernization 
while the ultimate distribution of us federal funds and project assignments can vary  the company expects its broad i t and outsourcing capabilities to be viewed favorably by the us federal government 
while demand for i t outsourcing services continues to grow  particularly in europe  the i t services industry continued to experience overall flat global demand for commercial project oriented activities during fiscal many customers maintained lower levels of discretionary spending in response to the economic environment in their region  particularly in central europe 
however  indications suggest stabilization in the north american market s demand for consulting and systems integration services  although the company expects continued global price pressure resulting from supply conditions 
worldwide global demand for outsourcing services is expected to be strong again during fiscal  particularly for business process outsourcing bpo 
to capitalize on the expanding human resources hr bpo market  csc entered into a strategic alliance with aon human resources outsourcing to deliver hr bpo services 
while the future demand for outsourcing services is not known with certainty  the long term nature of major outsourcing engagements allows csc to benefit from a certain level of continuity 
thus  the record setting year of new business awards for continuing operations  much of which came from new outsourcing engagements is expected to generate growth in fiscal global commercial revenues 
during fiscal  the company s global commercial segment benefited from currency fluctuations in europe and other international regions 
the company cannot forecast with certainty future movement in currency exchange rates or its impact on operating results 
the company s overall short term financial objectives include successfully launch the numerous new contracts won during fiscal  with particular focus on the large new outsourcing contracts 
effectively manage working capital and capital investment 
maintain appropriate investment base turnover rates and operating margins  particularly focusing on the new business  in order to generate an improved return on investment 
pursue the large current pipeline of commercial and us federal opportunities and win the company s proportionate share 
strategically deploy the proceeds of recent divestitures to further strengthen the company s financial position and capitalize on growth and expansion opportunities 
the company s primary long term objective is to continue developing and obtaining the core capabilities and differentiating factors that will enable csc to compete effectively in both the federal and global commercial markets 
the company will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities that enhance its core capabilities and review its portfolio of business operations for overall strategic fit 
continued long term revenue and earnings growth will come from the combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
results of operations revenues revenues for the global commercial and us federal sector segments see note for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal are as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in millions amount percent change amount percent change amount us commercial europe other international global commercial sector us federal sector corporate total the major factors affecting the percent change in revenues are presented as follows fiscal vs 
fiscal approximate impact of currency fluctuations net internal growth total us commercial europe other international global commercial sector us federal sector corporate total fiscal vs 
fiscal dyncorp acquisition approximate impact of currency fluctuations net internal growth total us commercial europe other international global commercial sector us federal sector corporate total for fiscal revenue performance versus fiscal  the impact of significant new commercial engagements offset the impact of the completion  reduced scope or de consolidation of a small number of significant federal programs 
global commercial growth for fiscal of in constant currency was led by the european region  where new outsourcing engagements offset continued weak demand for consulting and systems integration 
us operations also benefited from recent major contract wins but additionally saw modest growth in consulting and systems integration revenue 
in the us federal sector  the impact of billion of announced contract awards did not offset revenue declines on certain programs  and fiscal revenue declined to billion 
the most significant drivers of revenue growth for fiscal were the full year impact of the march dyncorp acquisition and the impact of currency fluctuations  which contributed and of growth  respectively 
the remaining overall internal growth of a net 
was the result of growth in the global commercial segment s european region and growth in the us federal sector s defense business  offset by declines in other global commercial regions as well as in federal sector s civil business 
strong outsourcing revenue growth in global commercial  particularly in the united kingdom and europe s nordic region  was offset by reduced consulting and systems integration work 
the company s announced billion in new business awards compared with billion announced for fiscal global commercial global commercial revenue growth was for fiscal  or in constant currency 
new major engagements continue to be the company s significant driver of global commercial revenue growth  contributing approximately million of fiscal revenue 
these engagements encompass both outsourcing and other i t and professional services 
announced commercial contract wins totaled billion for fiscal and billion for fiscal  csc s two most successful years ever for that measure 
existing base revenues declined somewhat for fiscal  due to normal contract completions and declines as productivity increases are reflected in declining bill rates to clients 
europe revenues increased million for fiscal  representing growth  in constant currency 
major new engagements contributing to this performance included the uk national health service and the european operations of zurich financial services  as well as the full year impact of the fiscal sas group and national grid transco contract commencements 
revenue growth attributable to these new engagements of approximately million and favorable currency movement of approximately million were offset by continued weakness in demand for the company s consulting and systems integration services in continental europe as well as reduced scope on certain existing outsourcing engagements 
europe has seen growth in the outsourcing market with economic conditions driving the adoption of outsourcing to help improve business performance 
by focusing on large opportunities  the company has significantly improved its market position as highlighted by the wins noted above 
us commercial revenue increased by million or 
this growth is primarily attributable to new fiscal and outsourcing contracts with the us operations of zurich financial services  aon  ascension health  textron and motorola  with total fiscal revenue growth impact of approximately million 
this impact and slight growth in the company s us consulting and systems integration business were offset somewhat by reduced volumes and billing rates on certain major outsourcing contracts 
the company s outsourcing contract with sears  roebuck co  which was terminated subsequent to year end  provided million of revenue during fiscal and favorably impacted revenue growth for the year 
other international revenues were up million from fiscal  though down in constant currency  primarily the result of reduced product sales  including the closure of a product reseller business in australia 
these reductions were offset somewhat by increased outsourcing revenues including the full year effect from the company s engagement with malayan banking berhad 
major outsourcing contract wins during fiscal and fiscal accounted for approximately million of fiscal global commercial revenue growth versus fiscal  driven by growing european outsourcing markets and increased market share 
these increases from outsourcing were more than offset by declines in consulting  systems integration and other areas  resulting in a net decline of 
for the year on a constant currency basis 
the company announced billion in new global commercial business awards during fiscal compared with the billion announced during fiscal and billion announced during fiscal primary contributors to global commercial s european fiscal revenue growth of on a constant currency basis included the following outsourcing contracts royal mail group  bombardier transportation  marconi  sas group  iss and national grid transco 
these six contracts combined for million of new revenue 
softness in demand for consulting and systems integration work  particularly in germany  france and italy  partially offset the outsourcing increases  resulting in the overall european revenue increase 
us commercial operations benefited during fiscal from growth on new and existing outsourcing contracts  including motorola  bombardier transportation  general dynamics  dun bradstreet  british telecom north america  ascension health and providian  which combined for million in fiscal revenue growth 
offsetting these improvements was the significantly reduced scope on the renewal of one engagement for which csc was previously the primary outsourcing provider and is now a subcontractor  resulting in a million decline 
in addition  two outsourcing contracts that substantially ended in fiscal resulted in a million decline year over year 
the net effect of the new business and other growth  offset by the various declines  resulted in an overall decline of for the us commercial operations in fiscal an constant currency revenue decline in other international fiscal revenues was driven by a drop in australian outsourcing revenues plus weaker third party product sales in australia and asia 
a product reseller business in australia was subsequently closed during fiscal us federal the company s us federal sector revenues were derived from the following sources fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in millions amount percent change amount percent change amount department of defense civil agencies other total us federal sector other revenues consist of state and local government as well as commercial contracts performed by the us federal sector reporting segment 
u 
s federal sector revenue for fiscal of  million was down million or 
the revenue decline was driven by the completion  reduced scope or de consolidation of a small number of significant programs  with a total impact of approximately million 
this impact  as well as that of other routine completions and volume reductions  was partially offset by program commencements and increased tasking on other programs 
during fiscal csc announced billion of new us federal contract awards  versus billion for fiscal and billion for fiscal department of defense revenue was down million or for fiscal the completion of and reduced efforts on several logistics contracts for the us army as well as the de consolidation of a previously consolidated joint venture due to decreased csc ownership accounted for approximately million of revenue reduction 
partially offsetting these reductions were new contracts for equipment procurement and installation for the us army and i t engineering and management efforts for the intelligence services  new tasking from the navy for computing equipment support  and a new contract to provide flight simulators to the us army 
these increases totaled approximately million 
the net impact of other normal contract activities start ups  completions  increased and decreased volumes accounted for the remaining change in revenue 
civil agencies revenue was down million or versus fiscal  driven by the completion of significant projects with nasa and the federal bureau of investigation 
the impact of these completions was approximately million 
scope reductions on other programs were partially offset by revenue from new contracts  including a program with the department of health and human services 
work performed by the us federal sector for state and local governments as well as commercial clients was million for fiscal  down million 
the decrease was driven primarily by a decline in development work on a contract with the new york department of health as the development stage of the contract winds down 
the company has identified billion of federal opportunities that will be awarded in fiscal which the company expects to pursue  plus an additional billion during fiscal the company expects to win a proportionate share of the awards 
dyncorp operations acquired late in fiscal  excluding units divested during fiscal  accounted for substantially all of the fiscal revenue growth of in the us federal sector 
excluding dyncorp  revenues from other federal sector operations increased slightly during fiscal  primarily from department of defense contracts  most notably missile defense  a us navy multiple awards contract  and several intelligence contracts  all of which combined for approximately million in additional revenue 
offsetting this growth was reduced level of effort on a logistics contract with the army  due to completion of the initial phase of the core project  and the de consolidation of a joint venture due to a reorganization that resulted in minority ownership for csc 
these two contracts accounted for a million decline for the year 
revenue from civil agencies  excluding dyncorp  was down for the year  driven mainly by decreases on contracts with the internal revenue service  department of education and nasa  which accounted for million in reduced revenues 
costs and expenses the company s costs and expenses were as follows dollar amount percentage of revenue dollars in millions costs of services selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization interest expense  net special items total costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal of were in line with fiscal levels  with certain identifiable variance factors generally offsetting 
the depreciation and amortization ratio was up somewhat  driven by fixed asset investments in the us federal sector and an unfavorable mix variance resulting from global commercial operations increasing as a percent of csc s total 
this increase was offset by a decrease in the interest expense ratio 
special items were flat as a percent of revenue for the two years 
the company substantially matches revenues and costs in the same currency 
therefore  the foreign currency impact of for the year on fiscal revenues and costs did not have a material impact on costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue 
however  the company is increasing its use of off shore support and therefore may be exposed to additional margin fluctuations 
changes to the various cost and expense ratio percentages for fiscal compared to fiscal were primarily due to the march dyncorp acquisition  excluding the subsequently divested international and other operations 
with generally more labor intensive operations  the acquired dyncorp business had higher costs of services cos as a percentage of revenue and lower ratios for selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as well as for depreciation and amortization d a expense 
in addition  the special items for fiscal and relate to the dyncorp acquisition 
excluding dyncorp operations  fiscal ratios for cos  sg a and d a would have been  and  respectively 
fiscal ratios would have been   and  respectively  excluding the three weeks of dyncorp operations at the end of the year 
costs of services costs of services as a percentage of revenue were for fiscal  unchanged from fiscal the global commercial sector ratio was essentially unchanged  vs 
 but had an approximately 
favorable mix impact on the company s composite ratio due to the increase in global commercial operations as a percentage of the total 
with a higher proportion of infrastructure services and a broader service offering  the global commercial sector cost base has relatively more depreciation and amortization and selling  general and administrative expenses and less labor and other cost of services than the us federal sector 
the global commercial cost of services ratio for fiscal benefited from certain revenue items  including the recognition of deferred revenue related to a renegotiated contract  client settlement payments and gains on the sale of minor  non core businesses 
these had an approximately 
favorable impact on the ratio 
the ratio also included the adverse impact of costs related to facility consolidations in our us consulting operations  certain asset write downs to net realizable value  and the cost of closure for our australian product reseller business 
these factors had an adverse impact of approximately 
on the cost of services ratio 
us federal sector cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased approximately 
current year factors include the recognition of costs on certain programs for which recoverability has been determined to not be probable  contributing approximately 
the year over year comparison is also adversely impacted by approximately 
by favorable adjustments during fiscal  as previously disclosed  resulting from normal program reviews on long term projects 
cost of services amounts carried at the corporate level include million of accrued cost related to the settlement of an overtime pay class action lawsuit 
these costs have not been allocated to the company s segments as individual settlement recipients have yet to be identified 
costs of services as a percentage of revenue improved slightly to for fiscal from for fiscal  when excluding the effect of the acquired dyncorp operations  which had a cos ratio of 
the improvement was driven primarily by other us federal sector operations  which posted a decrease to the cos ratio of points  partly offset by a 
point ratio increase in global commercial operations 
us federal sector results included adjustments from normal program reviews in fiscal and that resulted in a net year over year increase to profitability on long term contracts  as well as from the final settlement for modifications to a fixed price contract 
the global commercial 
point increase was driven by lower staff utilization in europe  primarily germany  france and italy  due to soft demand for consulting and systems integration project work 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses improved as a percentage of revenue for fiscal to  from for fiscal improvement was seen in both of csc s segments 
the us federal sector contributed approximately two thirds of the improvement  driven by reduced bid and proposal costs as a percentage of revenue as well as executive and administrative staff and other cost reductions 
global commercial ratio improvement was the result of leveraging existing levels of staff and systems to support the higher revenue level  particularly in us outsourcing operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses were unchanged at of revenues for fiscal  excluding the impact of dyncorp operations which had a sg a ratio for fiscal an increase in the ratio for other us federal operations of 
point was offset by a decrease in global commercial ratio of 
increased investment in business development activities in us federal sector was the primary cause for the slight increase there  in addition to somewhat higher insurance and other costs 
contributing about equally to the global commercial ratio improvement were a reduced need for provisions for doubtful accounts and other cost improvements  the latter primarily in outsourcing operations 
the provision for doubtful accounts benefited from the company s long term client relationships  generally high client credit quality  and a lack of charges seen in prior years related to weakness in the high technology and telecommunications markets 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense of  million for fiscal represents of revenue  up from for fiscal an increase in the ratio for the us federal sector and an unfavorable mix variance more than offset slight improvement in the global commercial segment 
the us federal sector increase  accounting for approximately 
of the company s ratio increase  is most significantly attributable to fixed asset investments on a large infrastructure outsourcing contract 
the unfavorable mix variance  also contributing 
of the ratio rise  is the result of the increasing global commercial activities share of the total 
global commercial operations  with a higher proportion of infrastructure related services  have a higher ratio of depreciation and amortization expense to revenue 
the mix impact was offset somewhat  and the global commercial ratio decreased slightly for fiscal  due to new outsourcing accounts  particularly in the us  having lower depreciation and amortization than the existing composite business 
this is primarily attributable to certain new clients for which csc did not purchase the existing asset inventory  but will be responsible for asset replacement 
therefore  the depreciation ratio on those accounts can be expected to rise over time 
excluding the dyncorp operations  which had only a d a ratio  the company s ratio for fiscal increased to of revenues versus in the prior year 
increases at other us federal operations were a primary cause of the overall increase  and were mainly due to internal software and computer equipment additions that were made during fiscal to accommodate the increased demands from the dyncorp operations 
the global commercial d a ratio was basically unchanged from the level 
interest expense the decrease in interest expense  net of interest income  for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to lower average debt levels and an increase in interest income 
the generation of cash flow  which limited the need to issue commercial paper  and the retirement of billion of term debt during march combined to reduce interest expense by million 
in addition  interest income  including income from the invested proceeds from the sale of dyncorp international  increased approximately million for fiscal resulting in a 
improvement in the net interest expense ratio 
the increase in interest expense  net of interest income  for fiscal verses fiscal is primarily attributable to additional borrowings  driven in part by the dyncorp acquisition 
as a percentage of revenues  net interest improved slightly for fiscal special items during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company recorded a charge of million for premium payments and the write down of deferred financing costs and interest discount related to the early redemption of billion of term debt 
the company elected to make this early redemption and incur the charges as it had available cash and these debt issues carried interest rates above current prevailing rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further description 
the debt redemption charge was partially offset by the reversal in the fourth quarter of previously recorded facility restructuring accruals of 
million 
the combined special items had a per share impact on earnings per share and a 
net impact on the company s profit margin in fiscal csc s net profit margin for fiscal was reduced 
for charges associated with the special item related to the dyncorp acquisition 
the charges relate to exit or disposal activities of legacy csc operations as a result of an assessment of requirements for the combined csc dyncorp organization 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further description 
charges related to this special item were booked during the fourth quarter of fiscal through the third quarter of fiscal and had an per share impact on earnings per share in fiscal the impact to fiscal margins was insignificant 
taxes the provision for taxes on continuing operations as a percentage of pre tax earnings was  and for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal was primarily a result of increased profits and the decreasing impact of existing favorable permanent tax differences that do not vary directly with increased profits 
the continuation of this trend is expected to increase the company s effective tax rate on continuing operations for fiscal the increases in pretax income in fiscal and resulted in a million and million increase in taxes for fiscal and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations net of taxes was million including the gain noted below  million and million  respectively  for fiscal years  and income from discontinued operations during fiscal includes the net after tax gain on the sale of dyncorp international of million or approximately per share 
proceeds from the sale included million of cash and million of paid in kind preferred shares 
discontinued operations includes the operations of dyncorp international  sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the operations of health plan solutions which is classified as held for sale as of april  and has been sold subsequent to year end 
the gain is subject to the finalization of working capital adjustments which are payable in paid in kind preferred shares 
these working capital adjustments are subject to final agreement of the parties or arbitration and combined with the health plan solutions exchange will result in a gain during fiscal financial condition cash flows dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal net cash from operations net cash used in investing net cash used in financing effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year historically  the majority of the company s cash and cash equivalents have been provided from operating activities 
operating activities for fiscal generated billion in net cash  up from billion generated for fiscal higher net earnings  coupled with higher levels of accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue  drove the increase in operating cash 
in addition  higher non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and an increase in deferred revenue as a result of prepayments from customers for services and up front payments for contract start up and transition activities contributed to the increase in cash generated from operating activities 
these payments are subject to contract terms and can be expected to fluctuate as contracts within the company s portfolio commence  move beyond start up phases  and are completed 
partially offsetting these inflows was an increase in prepaid expenses as the result of increases in work in process and deferred costs related to expected contract modifications with the us federal government  and an increase in receivables due to the growth in revenue 
the increase in receivables was driven by the increase in revenues  offsetting an improvement in year end dso 
cash flow from operations for fiscal is expected to be impacted by an increase in the company s investment in working capital  as the result of new business won during fiscal  and an increase in the payment of income taxes during fiscal during fiscal  net cash provided from operations increased to billion from billion as a result of higher net earnings  an increase in non cash expenses  an improvement in year end dso and improved cash disbursements management 
an increase in deferred revenue as the result of customer prepayments for services and upfront payments for contract start up and transition activities on certain contracts also contributed to the increase 
partially offsetting these inflows were investments in new outsourcing contracts 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the securities and exchange commission staff indicated that auction rate securities should not be classified as cash equivalents unless  when purchased  the maturity of the underlying debt is less than days 
the company had classified its occasional holdings of auction rate securities as cash equivalents regardless of the maturity of the underlying debt 
as a result  the company reclassified million of auction rate securities held at april  from cash and cash equivalents to available for sale investments 
this reclassification had no impact on operating cash flows but did increase investing cash outflow during fiscal by million and reduced investing cash outflow for fiscal by the corresponding amount 
the company had no auction rate securities as of the end of fiscal the company s investments principally relate to purchases of computer equipment and software  and deferred outsourcing contract costs that support the company s expanding global commercial operations 
investments include computer equipment purchased at the inception of outsourcing contracts as well as for subsequent upgrades  expansion or replacement of these client supporting assets 
for cash flow presentation purposes  the outsourcing contracts line includes amounts paid to clients for assets purchased from the clients that are categorized as property and equipment on the balance sheet 
outsourcing contract costs are also comprised of incremental external costs as well as certain internal costs that directly relate to a contract s acquisition or start up  including payments to clients for amounts in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets premium 
major new fiscal outsourcing contracts  including zurich financial services and ascension health contracts and design and build contracts with the united kingdom s national health service  drove much of the increased investments during the year 
the new fiscal outsourcing contracts  as well as contractually driven equipment replacement requirements on existing contracts  are also expected to drive fiscal investing cash outflows 
significant capital expenditures and outsourcing contract costs are expected for engagements with united technologies corporation utc  zurich financial services  bae systems plc bae and uk national health service and two uk federal sector contracts an army aviation training contract and an intelligence services contract 
despite the anticipated investments on new contracts  investing cash outflows are expected to decrease slightly during fiscal total operating cash inflows are expected to more than cover total investing outflows for fiscal the company s investments also include acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  including significant amounts for fiscal related to the acquisition of dyncorp 
while increasing new business will typically generate higher overall capital investments  the mix of the new business will impact the level of capital per contract 
the growth in us federal awards during fiscal and the expected growth in consulting and systems integration work is expected to limit the growth in overall capital investment in fiscal as us federal contracts and consulting and systems integration projects typically require lower levels of initial investment when compared with similar commercial outsourcing contracts 
this coupled with the company s continued focus on improving cash flows and return on investment is expected to result in a decrease in cash outflow from investing activities for fiscal dispositions of investments in businesses have from time to time generated investing cash flows for the company 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the disposition of dyncorp international generated million in cash proceeds 
as discussed below the company used these proceeds to reduce debt levels during that quarter 
as described above  historically a majority of the company s capital investments have been funded by cash from operations 
net cash outflows from financing activities over the past three years reflect the company s commitment to reduce its overall debt levels and improve its debt to total capitalization ratio 
continuing this commitment to reduce debt levels the company utilized proceeds from the sale of dyncorp international to redeem billion of term debt during the fourth quarter of fiscal this reduced the company s overall year end debt level to its lowest level since fiscal cash outflows to redeem the term debt included million of early redemption premiums 
at year end fiscal  there was no outstanding commercial paper  a result of cash generated from operations 
partially offsetting the financing cash out flows from debt redemption and repayment of borrowings were cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
during fiscal the company issued million of term debt due april with the proceeds used to reduce outstanding commercial paper and support general corporate purposes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company issued million shares to partially fund the dyncorp acquisition 
in addition  the company issued million of notes due february  the funds were used for general corporate purposes  including reduction of outstanding commercial paper which had increased as a result of paying off assumed dyncorp debt and the cash portion of the dyncorp consideration 
liquidity and capital resources the balance of cash and cash equivalents was  million at april   million at april   and million at march  during fiscal  equity increased due to the company s earnings as well as a foreign currency translation adjustment of million  offset by an increase in unfunded pension obligations of million 
at the end of fiscal  csc s ratio of debt to total capitalization was  down from at the end of fiscal and at the end of fiscal these debt ratio improvements were the result of debt reduction and equity increases during fiscal and fiscal the company s debt to total capitalization ratio of as of the end of fiscal is low compared to the company s ratios during the last five years 
however  the ratio may rise in the future if the company identifies suitable investment opportunities or other significant capital requirements 
dollars in millions debt equity total capitalization debt to total capitalization the company s sources of liquidity include cash  commercial paper and committed and uncommitted lines of credit 
short term borrowings are principally used to supplement operating cash flow in funding working capital requirements 
forecasted positive cash flows are expected to limit the need for short term borrowings during fiscal at april   the company had a committed line of credit providing million of long term commercial paper backup which expires on august  if the company were unable to sell its commercial paper  borrow under its uncommitted lines of credit  or determines it is too costly to do either of the aforementioned  the company has the ability to borrow under this committed line of credit 
this line of credit has the option of being drawn at a base rate  a eurodollar rate or a bid option rate 
the line requires the company to limit liens placed on our assets to million and to liens incurred in the ordinary course of business  maintain a not to exceed ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization of 
to  and not permit on any date the ratio of consolidated total debt outstanding on such date to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such date  to exceed to 
for further details on this agreement please see exhibit  which is incorporated by reference to this annual report 
as of april   the company had no borrowings under these lines and was in compliance with all terms of the agreements 
at april   the company had million of short term borrowings and billion of long term debt 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the classification of the commercial paper is determined by the expiration date of its credit facility 
the company had no outstanding commercial paper as of april  in march  the company used the proceeds from the sale of dyncorp international and cash on hand to redeem the term notes due august  and the term notes due june for million  and early redemption premium of million 
in addition  during fiscal  the company issued million of term debt from its fiscal shelf registration 
on march   the company instituted a voluntary share repurchase program for shareholders owning less than shares 
under this program which has now expired  the company repurchased  shares for million on april  and  shares for 
million on may  the company s short term commercial paper has ratings from standard poor s  moody s and fitch of a  p and f  respectively  and the company s term debt has ratings from standards poor s  moody s and fitch of a  a and a  respectively 
all of these credit ratings have stable outlooks 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the following table summarizes the expiration of the company s financial guarantees outstanding as of april  dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total performance guarantees surety bonds letters of credit standby letters of credit foreign subsidiary debt guarantees total see note for a discussion of the above financial guarantees 
the following table summarizes the company s payments on contractual obligations by period as of april  dollars in millions less than year years years more than years total long term debt interest on fixed rate debt capital lease obligations bank debt operating leases minimum purchase obligations other long term liabilities total regarding minimum purchase obligations included above  the company has signed long term purchase agreements with certain software  hardware  telecommunication and other service providers to obtain favorable pricing  committed service levels and terms for services necessary for the operations of business activities 
the company is contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over remaining periods ranging generally from one to five years 
if the company does not meet the specified service minimums  the company may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion or all of the shortfall 
the above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retiree benefit plans as set forth by the employee retirement income security act erisa 
the company has numerous plans  both inside and outside of the us  and determines expected funding requirements on a per plan basis 
the minimum funding requirement can vary significantly from year to year based on a variety of factors  and can be in some years 
funding is determined based on a review of benefit obligations and plan assets as well as various regulatory requirements including erisa and cost accounting standards cas 
while there are certain minimum contributions requirements  csc may elect to increase the level of funding of contributions based on a number of factors including performance of pension investments  changes in workforce composition and the ability to recover costs on cost reimbursable contracts 
during fiscal  the company expects to make contributions of approximately million to pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the company has not quantified expected contributions beyond fiscal because it is not possible to predict future timing or direction of the capital markets  which can have a significant impact on future minimum funding obligations 
refer to the critical accounting estimates section later in this md a and to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
fiscal contributions were million 
of this amount million was made toward the end of fiscal in order to increase non us pension plans funded position 
these fiscal year contribution figures may differ from those in note to the consolidated financial statements due to the use of a december st measurement date in that note 
in the opinion of management  csc will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities  cash balances  and unused short term borrowing capacity 
if these resources need to be augmented  major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the company filed a shelf registration statement for up to billion of debt and or equity securities 
the company has previously issued million worth of term debt from the shelf registration  leaving million of shelf available for additional securities 
dividends and redemption it has been the company s policy to invest earnings in the growth of the company rather than distribute earnings as dividends 
this policy  under which dividends have not been paid since fiscal  is expected to continue  but is subject to regular review by the board of directors 
critical accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements under summary of significant accounting policies 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
many of the types of estimates made are for contract specific issues 
while changes to estimates or assumptions on a specific contract could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements  the risk is mitigated by the company s broad portfolio of contracts that would typically have offsetting adjustments 
the company has identified several critical accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved  and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting estimates relate to revenue recognition and cost estimation and recoverability on long term  fixed price contracts  revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization  capitalization of outsourcing contract costs and software development costs  estimates used to determine deferred income taxes  assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill  assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities  and assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation 
for all of these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition and cost estimation and recoverability on long term  fixed price contracts while fixed price contracts that use percentage of completion accounting currently comprise less than of csc s total revenue  the determination of revenues and costs on such contracts requires significant judgment and estimation 
the method requires estimates of costs and profits over the entire term of the contract  including estimates of resources and costs necessary to complete performance 
such estimates are particularly difficult on activities involving state of the art technologies such as system development projects 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company s software engineers  program managers and financial professionals 
key factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract profitability include the availability and productivity of labor and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
management regularly reviews project profitability and the underlying estimates 
modifications to contract scope  schedule  and price may be required on development contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
accounting for such changes prior to formal contract modification requires evaluation of the characteristics and circumstances of the effort completed and assessment of probability of recovery 
if recovery is deemed probable  the company may  as appropriate  either defer the costs until the parties have agreed on the contract change or recognize the costs and related revenue as current period contract performance 
the company routinely negotiates such contract modifications in both the us federal and global commercial sectors 
revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization if significant customization is required in the delivery of a proprietary software product  revenue is recognized as the software customization services are performed in accordance with the percentage of completion method described above 
thus  cost and profit estimates are required over the life of the project  and changes in such estimates can have a material effect on results 
capitalization of outsourcing contract costs certain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and amortized over the contract life 
these costs consist of contract acquisition and transition set up costs  and include the cost of due diligence activities after competitive selection  costs associated with installation of systems and processes  and amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets premiums 
finance staff  working with program management  review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with relevant accounting guidance 
key estimates and assumptions that the company must make include assessing the fair value of acquired assets in order to calculate the premium and projecting future cash flows in order to assess the recoverability of deferred costs 
the company utilizes the experience and knowledge of its professional staff in program management  operations  procurement and finance areas  as well as third parties on occasion  to determine fair values of assets acquired 
to assess recoverability  undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining life and compared to the unamortized deferred cost balance 
such estimates require judgment and assumptions  which are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of company personnel 
key factors that are considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include projected labor costs and productivity efficiencies 
a significant change in an estimate or assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
amortization of such premiums is recorded as a reduction to revenues 
capitalization of software development costs the company capitalizes certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internal use software 
significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives  estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues  and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment 
for commercial software products  determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products 
the company considers various factors to project marketability and future revenues  including an assessment of alternative solutions or products  current and historical demand for the product  and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete 
for internal use software  the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of the company s ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis 
to assess the realizability or recoverability of capitalized software costs  the company must estimate future revenue  costs and cash flows 
such estimates require assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows  and are based on the experience and knowledge of professional staff 
a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to the company s results of operations 
estimates used to determine deferred income taxes the company makes certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
the company also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets  and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly 
considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset  planned use of the tax asset  and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates 
valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors 
assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill the company accounts for its acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired  including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customer related intangibles  as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment 
liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition  and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value 
third party valuation firms may be used to appraise certain assets and liabilities  but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by the company  such as forecasted revenues or profits on contract related intangibles 
numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments  which are conducted by company professionals from legal  finance  human resources  information systems  program management and other disciplines 
changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values  resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 
as goodwill is not amortized  goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment 
such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values 
cash flow projections are based on management approved estimates  which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance  operations and program management 
key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts  estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs  and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates 
significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing can have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities the company offers a number of pension and postretirement benefit and life insurance benefit plans 
csc utilizes actuarial methods required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  to account for pension and postretirement benefit plans  respectively 
the actuarial methods require numerous assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans 
two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rates 
in making these assumptions  we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates 
changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should  over time  approximate the actual long term returns on pension plan assets 
the assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for each plan  the asset mix of the plan  historic plan asset returns as well as current market conditions and other factors 
the weighted average of the expected long term rates of return on plan assets utilized for the fiscal pension plan valuations was compared to used in fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed rates of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased  respectively  the net periodic pension cost by approximately million 
an assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial valuation 
the discount rate assumption reflects the market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of the company s pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
the weighted average of the discount rates utilized for the fiscal pension plan valuations was compared to used for fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed discount rates would have increased or decreased the net periodic pension cost by approximately million 
some portion of the increase or decrease would be moderated by cost reimbursable contracts 
the accounting guidance includes mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in earnings which would otherwise result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which such changes occur 
for example  while the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should  over time  approximate the actual long term returns  differences between the expected and actual returns may occur in any given year 
such differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses which are then amortized over time 
for csc  negative financial market returns for fiscal resulted in lower than expected pension plan asset returns  while positive market returns for fiscal and fiscal caused actual pension plan asset returns to exceed those expected 
declining discount rates over the past several years  which resulted in higher calculated benefit obligations  served to partially offset or more than offset the positive impact of the asset returns for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
sfas no 
requires recognition of a minimum pension obligation if the fair value of plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation abo at the end of the year 
at the end of both fiscal and fiscal  some of the company s pension plans had abos in excess of the fair value of their respective plan assets  thus requiring additional minimum obligations 
the excess at the end of fiscal was higher than at the end of fiscal as a result  the company was required to adjust the additional minimum pension liability recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
the effect of this adjustment was to increase the minimum pension liability by million during fiscal  decrease intangible assets by million and record a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income of million million net of taxes 
based on future plan asset performance and interest rates  additional changes to equity might be required 
assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation the company is subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits  insurance  tax and other issues arising out of the normal course of business 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on management s view of the expected outcome 
csc consults with legal counsel on issues related to litigation and seeks input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable  the company accrues a liability in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
significant changes in the estimates or assumptions used in assessing the likelihood of an adverse outcome could have a material effect on the consolidated financial results

these factors include  without limitation  the following i changes in demand for information technology outsourcing  business process outsourcing and consulting and systems integration services  ii the company s ability to continue to develop and expand its service offerings to address emerging business demands and technological trends  iii competitive pressures  iv the company s ability to consummate divestitures  and to consummate and integrate acquisitions and form alliances  v early termination of customer contracts  vi the company s ability to collect its accounts receivable on a timely basis  vii the company s ability to recover its capital investment in outsourcing contracts  viii the profitability of long term customer contracts and fixed price customer contracts  and the company s ability to negotiate appropriate contract modifications  ix the company s exposure to financially troubled customers  x pending litigation  xi the company s ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  and xii general economic conditions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates in countries in which the company does business 
the company is engaged in providing services under contracts with the us government 
these contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements and  from time to time  agencies of the us government investigate whether the company s operations are being conducted in accordance with these requirements 
us government investigations of the company  whether related to the company s federal government contracts or conducted for other reasons  could result in administrative  civil or criminal liabilities  including repayments  fines or penalties being imposed upon the company  or could lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracting

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company utilizes fixed rate long term debt obligations  short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments 
a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows 
foreign currency during the ordinary course of business  the company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency 
potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process 
the company generally manages these transactions by incurring costs to service contracts in the same currency in which revenue is received 
short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency 
by generally matching revenues  costs and borrowings to the same currency  the company has been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings 
however  the company is increasing its use of off shore support and is therefore becoming more exposed to currency fluctuations 
if necessary  the company may use foreign currency forward contracts or options to hedge exposures arising from these transactions 
during fiscal  of the company s revenue was generated outside of the united states 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenue by or million  while a hypothetical decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by or million 
in the opinion of management  a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
as a result  a hypothetical movement of the value of the us dollar against all currencies in either direction would impact the company s earnings before interest and taxes by million 
this amount would be offset  in part  from the impacts of local income taxes and local currency interest expense 
at april   the company had approximately million of non us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents  and approximately million of non us dollar borrowings
