our business we receive revenues primarily from the delivery of residential  training  educational and support services to various populations with special needs 
as of december   we had three reportable operating segments i disabilities services  ii youth services and iii training services 
management s discussion and analysis of each segment is included below 
commencing january   as a result of integrating the youth services operating segment into our existing divisions  youth services will no longer be a reportable operating segment going forward 
further information regarding our segments is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues for our disabilities services operations are derived primarily from state medicaid programs and from management contracts with private operators  generally not for profit providers  who contract with state government agencies and are also reimbursed under the medicaid program 
we also provide respite  therapeutic and other services on an as needed basis or hourly basis through our periodic in home services programs that are reimbursed on a unit of service basis 
reimbursement varies by state and service type  and may be based on a variety of methods including flat rate  cost based reimbursement  per person per diem  or unit of service basis 
generally  rates are adjusted annually based upon historical costs experienced by us and by other service providers  or economic conditions and their impact on state budgets 
at facilities and programs where we are the provider of record  we are directly reimbursed under state medicaid programs for services we provide and such revenues are affected by occupancy levels 
at most facilities and programs that we operate pursuant to management contracts  the management fee is negotiated with the provider of record 

table of contents we operate programs for at risk and troubled youths through our youth services operation 
most of the youth services programs are funded directly by federal  state and local government agencies including school systems 
under these contracts  we are typically reimbursed based on fixed contract amounts  flat rates or cost based rates 
our training services division includes job corps and other job training and placement programs 
we operate vocational training centers under the federal job corps program administered by the dol 
under job corps contracts  we are reimbursed for direct facility and program costs related to job corps center operations  allowable indirect costs for general and administrative costs  plus a predetermined management fee 
the management fee can take the form of a fixed contractual amount or be computed based on certain performance criteria 
all of such amounts are reflected as revenue  and all such direct costs are reflected as facility and program costs 
final determination of amounts due under job corps contracts is subject to audit and review by the dol  and renewals and extension of job corps contracts are based in part on performance reviews 
we also operate job training and placement programs that assist disadvantaged job seekers in finding employment and improving their career prospects 
these programs are funded through performance based or fixed fee contracts from local and state governments 
application of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development  selection  and application of our critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
valuation of accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from medicaid programs  other government agencies and commercial insurance companies 
an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is recorded to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
in evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable  we consider a number of factors  including historical loss rates  age of the accounts  changes in collection patterns  the status of ongoing disputes with third party payors  general economic conditions and the status of state budgets 
complex rules and regulations regarding billing and timely filing requirements in various states are also a factor in our assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
actual collections of accounts receivable in subsequent periods may require changes in the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in these estimates are charged or credited to the results of operations in the period of the change of estimate 
there were no material changes in our method of providing for reserves for doubtful accounts for the years ended december  or reserves for insurance risks we self insure a substantial portion of our professional and general liability  workers compensation and health benefit risks 
provisions for losses for these risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates 
the allowances for these risks include an amount determined from reported claims and an amount based on past experiences for losses incurred but not reported 
estimates of workers compensation claims reserves are discounted using a discount rate of at december  and an increase or decrease in the discount rate of basis points would change the reserve  and resulting expense  by million 
these liabilities are necessarily based on estimates and  while we believe that the provision for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than the amounts recorded 
the liabilities are reviewed quarterly and any adjustments are reflected in earnings in the period known 
there were no material changes in our method of providing reserves for insurance risks for the years ended december  or 
table of contents legal contingencies we are party to numerous claims and lawsuits with respect to various matters 
the material legal proceedings in which rescare is currently involved are described in item of this report and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we provide for costs related to contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount is reasonably determinable 
we confer with outside counsel in estimating our potential liability for certain legal contingencies 
while we believe our provision for legal contingencies is adequate  the outcome of legal proceedings is difficult to predict and we may settle legal claims or be subject to judgments for amounts that exceed our estimates 
there were no material changes to our method of providing reserves for legal contingencies during the years ended december  or valuation of long lived assets we regularly review the carrying value of long lived assets with respect to any events or circumstances that indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
indicators of impairment include  but are not limited to  loss of contracts  significant census declines  reductions in reimbursement levels and significant litigation 
our evaluation is based on cash flow  profitability and projections that incorporate current or projected operating results  as well as significant events or changes in the environment 
if circumstances suggest the recorded amounts cannot be recovered  the carrying values of such assets are reduced to fair value based upon various techniques to estimate fair value 
goodwill with respect to businesses we have acquired  we evaluate the costs of purchased businesses in excess of net assets acquired goodwill for impairment at least annually  unless significant changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may have occurred sooner 
we are required to test goodwill on a reporting unit basis 
we use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment and recognize an impairment charge for the amount  if any  by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implicit fair value 
fair values are established using a weighted average of comparative market multiples in the current market conditions and discounted cash flows 
discounted cash flow computations depend on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
the discount rate used as of december  and was and  respectively 
the increase is primarily a result of the equity financing which took place during the year  thereby increasing the weighted average cost of capital 
a variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the impairment analysis 
for example  a increase in the discount rate would decrease the fair value of the reporting unit by million  million and million for the disabilities  youth and training services reporting units  respectively  whereas a decrease in the discount rate would increase the fair value by million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  we make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies used in determining market multiples in valuing our reporting units  as well as certain assumptions to allocate shared assets and liabilities to calculate values for each of our reporting units 
an increase in the multiple by basis points would increase the fair value of the reporting unit by million  million and million for the disabilities  youth and training services reporting units  respectively  whereas a decrease by basis points would decrease the fair value by million  million and million  respectively 
no valuation losses were recorded during the years ended december  or 
table of contents revenue recognition disabilities services 
revenues are derived primarily from state medicaid programs  other government agencies  and from management contracts with private operators  generally not for profit providers  who contract with state agencies and are also reimbursed under the medicaid programs 
revenues are recorded at rates established at or before the time services are rendered 
revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered 
youth services 
juvenile treatment revenues are derived primarily from contracts with state agencies under various reimbursement systems 
reimbursement from state or locally awarded contracts varies per facility or program  and is typically paid under fixed contract amounts  flat rates  or cost based rates 
revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered 
training services 
revenues include amounts reimbursable under cost reimbursement contracts with the dol for operating job corps centers and with local and state governments and private contractors for other job training and placement programs 
the contracts provide reimbursement for all facility and program costs related to operations  allowable indirect costs for general and administrative costs  plus a predetermined management fee  normally a combination of fixed and performance based 
final determination of amounts due under the contracts is subject to audit and review by the applicable government agencies 
revenue is recognized in the period associated costs are incurred 
laws and regulations governing the government programs and contracts are complex and subject to interpretation 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
for each operating segment  expenses are subject to examination by agencies administering the contracts and services 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made for potential adjustments arising from such examinations 
there were no material changes in the application of our revenue recognition policies during the years ended december  or year in review revenues for the year ended december  were billion  net income was million  and cash provided from operations was million 
these items are discussed in more detail in the following sections of the md a 
the following highlights some of the events of the past year on june   we completed a transaction with four investment funds affiliated with onex corporation 
under the terms of the agreement  the onex partners purchased  shares of rescare s series a convertible preferred shares at a purchase price of  per share or a total price of million 
the preferred shares are convertible into approximately million shares of rescare s common stock  based on a value of per common share 
net proceeds from the onex transaction were million 
issuance costs of approximately million  including a million transaction fee to onex corporation  were recorded as a reduction in shareholders equity 
as a result of the transaction  onex beneficially owns approximately of the outstanding shares of rescare 
under the accounting treatment for the transaction  the non cash beneficial conversion feature assumed in the preferred stock was calculated at million and is a deduction from net income in computing basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareholders 
the beneficial conversion feature does not affect net income  cash flows  total shareholders equity  or compliance with our debt covenants 
in addition  we recorded an expense of million related to payments required under the provisions of the director stock option plans as a result of the transaction 
under the terms of the transaction  the board of directors appointed four new board members  three of whom were designated by onex  to replace retiring board members 

table of contents we created an international operations unit under the training services division 
through this newly created unit  we have been chosen as a subcontractor to provide vocational assessment  training and job placement to iraqi citizens 
our subcontract is for million over two years 
we will offer training and job placement opportunities 
we also received a million subcontract to provide assessment  vocational training and job placement for people with disabilities in jordan 
both the iraq and jordan subcontracts had minimal financial impact in the disabilities services division added ten new small acquisitions which complement our core business in this division 
these operations are expected to generate annual revenues of approximately million and provide services to approximately  consumers 
the training services division was awarded contracts by the dol to continue operating the following job corps centers fred g 
acosta job corps center in tucson  arizona  miami job corps center in miami  florida  phoenix job corps center in phoenix  arizona  and treasure island job corps center in san francisco  california 
these job corps centers represent million in revenues over two year periods 
each contract is for two years  with three one year options for renewal 
additionally  the training services division was awarded a new contract to operate the homestead florida job corps center  valued at million over the two year term 
we completed the acquisition of the assets and operations of tti america  inc tti  a training and employment company doing business in california and florida 
tti is expected to generate approximately million in annual revenues and is part of arbor within the training services division 
effective december   arbor was awarded a million contract over three years to provide employment training services to persons in the new york city boroughs of queens and brooklyn 
the fair labor standards act was passed  certain provisions of which will increase labor costs  principally in the disabilities services division 
we estimate that the impact of this legislation will increase labor costs million annually 
in connection with our annual insurance program renewal process  we put the program and its administration out for bid 
as a result  we changed carriers and appointed a new third party administrator to handle our claims 
for the new policy year which began july   we expect our administrative costs to be reduced by over million on an annualized basis 
although the outcome of the state budgetary process is difficult to predict  we expect reimbursement rates for to remain flat in comparison with rates 

table of contents results of operations year ended december dollars in thousands revenues disabilities services youth services training services consolidated labor cost as of revenue disabilities services youth services training services consolidated operating income disabilities services youth services training services corporate and other consolidated operating margin disabilities services youth services training services consolidated consolidated revenues for increased over  due primarily to new homes added in  full year impact of new homes added in  growth in our periodic in home services  growth in our subsidiary  arbor  and revenues from various small acquisitions in consolidated revenues for increased over  attributable primarily to the acquisition of arbor  the new homes added in  full year impact of the new homes added in  and the continued growth in our periodic in home services offset by overall rate decreases of approximately and the loss of the clements job corps contract 
operating income increased in over this increase is attributed to the growth areas described above relative to our revenue increases  offset partially by increases in corporate general and administrative expenses 
operating income increased to million in from million in due primarily to million of charges taken in and as a result of the arbor acquisition which added approximately million of operating income in as a percentage of total revenues  corporate general and administrative expenses remained fairly consistent at in  in and in depreciation and amortization was relatively consistent across all years presented 
interest expense decreased million in compared to  following the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes as of december  interest expense was comparable in versus our effective income tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in is lower than the statutory rate due principally to the impact of non taxable investment income and other miscellaneous non deductible expenses 
the effective tax rates in and approximated the statutory rate considering the impact of state taxes and the benefit of jobs credits 

table of contents disabilities services disabilities services revenues increased in over compared to a increase in over the addition of new homes contributed incremental revenues of million for periodic in home service revenues increased million in over additional increases are attributable to various small acquisitions in revenues increased in from incremental revenues for new homes added and growth in our periodic in home services 
operating margin increased in over  as a result of continued growth in the periodic in home services  the new homes program  continued improvement in the management of labor costs and continued cost controls 
operating margin for this division increased from in to in  due primarily to the effect of the write off of doubtful accounts receivable of million applicable to this division in youth services youth services revenues decreased in over and in over  resulting primarily from reduced revenues at certain operations 
operating margin of for decreased from in was a result of continued program closures  bed reductions and rate cuts for our juvenile justice programs 
operating margin for this division increased to in from in  due in part to the closure of under performing programs 
we believe the reductions reflect the funding priorities of these states in response to budgetary pressures 
training services training services revenues increased in over and in over the increase was due to additional centers and contracts at arbor 
the primary source of the increase was the addition of arbor and the tulsa job corps contract  which contributed approximately million and million  respectively  in revenues in this increase was partially offset by the loss of the clements job corps contract which contributed incremental revenues in of approximately million 
operating margins for this division were in line across all periods presented  with the primary driver of the increase being the arbor acquisition 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources total assets increased in over primarily due to the issuance of preferred stock resulting in million in net proceeds from the onex transaction and cash provided by operating activities 
during the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million for and million for the decrease in from was primarily the result of tax refunds received in which were not present in the increase in from was due primarily to tax refunds of million  higher profitability and strong cash collections 
days revenue in net accounts receivable were days at december   which remained constant with december  and december  net accounts receivable at december  increased to million  compared to million at december  and million at december  the increase in net accounts receivable over is due to growth at arbor  timing from new homes growth  and the acquisition of tti in december additionally  we experienced delayed collections in the fourth quarter from the dol due to their changes in payment processing 
collections were brought current in the increase in over relates to the overall increase in revenues including the addition of arbor 
of the total net accounts receivable balance at december  and  approximately were greater than days 

table of contents during the years ended december   and  cash used in investing activities was primarily for purchases of property and equipment and small acquisitions 
maintenance capital expenditures remained relatively constant at approximately of total revenues 
financing activities in were impacted by net proceeds of million from the sale of preferred shares to onex 
financing activities for resulted in the use of cash of million  primarily related to the redemption of the convertible subordinated notes offset by the draw down of million from the term loan 
financing activities for resulted in the use of cash amounting to million  primarily related to the redemption of debt during the year 
our capital requirements relate primarily to our plans to expand through selective acquisitions and the development of new facilities and programs  and our need for sufficient working capital for general corporate purposes 
since most of our facilities and programs are operating at or near capacity  and budgetary pressures and other forces are expected to limit increases in reimbursement rates we receive  our ability to continue to grow at the current rate depends directly on our acquisition and development activity 
we have historically satisfied our working capital requirements  capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments from our operating cash flow and utilization of our credit facility 
the funds provided by the onex transaction are an additional source of financing for our acquisition and development activities 
on december   we completed an agreement for a million senior credit facility and the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes originally due december this senior credit facility  due in january  includes a million revolver and a million term loan 
on june   our million senior credit facility was amended  primarily to reflect the onex transaction 
the amendment increased the amount of allowable acquisitions  as defined  waived the requirement for the proceeds from the onex transaction to be used to repay the outstanding balance of the term loan  and increased the sublimit for letters of credit to million 
in december  we formally issued the notice to call the convertible subordinated notes  which were redeemed by the trustee on january  we funded the redemption and were relieved as primary obligor on december   with million from the term loan and the remainder from cash on hand 
as of december   million remains drawn on the term loan and we had irrevocable standby letters of credit in the principal amount of million issued primarily in connection with our insurance programs 
as of december   we had million available under the revolver as our borrowing base under the revolver was million on that date 
our borrowing base is a function of our accounts receivable balance as of the reporting date 
the facility contains various financial covenants relating to net worth  capital expenditures and rentals and requires us to maintain specified ratios with respect to fixed charge coverage and leverage 
we are in compliance with our debt covenants as of december  our ability to achieve the thresholds provided for in the financial covenants largely depends upon the maintenance of continued profitability and or reductions of amounts borrowed under the facility  and continued cash collections 
as of december  and  included in our cash and cash equivalents balance is million of cash held on deposit with an insurance carrier as collateral for our insurance program 
in accordance with our collateral arrangement with the insurance carrier  such deposit may be exchanged at our discretion for a letter of credit 
operating funding sources are approximately through medicaid reimbursement  from the dol  from other government agencies  and the remaining from various sources including private payors 
we believe our sources of funds through operations and available through the credit facilities described above will be sufficient to meet our working capital  planned capital expenditure and scheduled debt repayment requirements for the next twelve months 

table of contents contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements information concerning our contractual obligations and commercial commitments follows in thousands payments due by period and contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase contracts total contractual cash obligations total amount of commitments expiring per period amounts and other commercial commitments committed thereafter standby letters of credit in accordance with the definition under securities and exchange commission rules  the following qualify as off balance sheet arrangements any obligation under certain guarantees or contracts  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  any obligation under a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the registrant  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with the registrant 
we had no significant off balance sheet transactions or interests 
certain risk factors we derive virtually all of our revenues from federal  state and local government agencies  including state medicaid programs 
our revenues therefore are impacted by the size of the governmental appropriations for the services we provide 
budgetary pressures  as well as economic  industry  political and other factors  could influence governments not to increase and possibly to decrease appropriations for these services  which could reduce our margins materially 
future federal or state initiatives could institute managed care programs for persons we serve or otherwise make material changes to the medicaid program as it now exists 
federal  state and local government agencies generally condition their contracts with us upon a sufficient budgetary appropriation 
if a government agency does not receive an appropriation sufficient to cover their contractual obligations with us  they may terminate a contract or defer or reduce our reimbursement 
additionally  there is risk that previously appropriated funds could be reduced through subsequent legislation  although we believe recoveries may be available through legal or other processes 
the loss or reduction of reimbursement under our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
this is mitigated by the fact that we operate in states 
for the year ended  we experienced an aggregate rate decrease for our disabilities services division of approximately 

table of contents our historical growth in revenues has been directly related to increases in the number of individuals served in each of our operating segments 
this growth has depended largely upon development driven activities  including the acquisitions of other businesses or facilities  the acquisition of management contract rights to operate facilities  the award of contracts to open new facilities or start new operations or to assume management of facilities previously operated by governmental agencies or other organizations  and the extension or renewal of contracts previously awarded to us 
our future revenues will depend primarily upon our ability to maintain  expand and renew existing service contracts and existing leases  and to a lesser extent upon our ability to obtain additional contracts to provide services to the special needs populations we serve  whether through awards in response to requests for proposals for new programs  in connection with facilities being privatized by governmental agencies  or by selected acquisitions 
our job corps contracts are re bid  regardless of operating performance  at least every five years 
we may not be successful in bidding for contracts to operate  or to continue operating  job corps centers 
changes in the market for services and contracts  including increasing competition  transition costs or costs to implement awarded contracts  could adversely affect the timing and or viability of future development activities 
additionally  many of our contracts are subject to state or federal government procurement rules and procedures  changes in procurement policies that may be adopted by one or more of these agencies could also adversely affect our ability to obtain and retain these contracts 
our revenues and operating profitability depend on our ability to maintain our existing reimbursement levels  to obtain periodic increases in reimbursement rates to meet higher costs and demand for more services  and to receive timely payment from applicable government agencies 
if we do not receive or cannot negotiate increases in reimbursement rates at approximately the same time as our costs of providing services increase  our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
changes in how federal and state government agencies operate reimbursement programs can also affect our operating results and financial condition 
government reimbursement  group home credentialing and mr dd client medicaid eligibility and service authorization procedures are often complicated and burdensome  and delays can result from  among other reasons  difficulties in timely securing documentation and coordinating necessary eligibility paperwork between agencies 
these reimbursement and procedural issues occasionally cause us to have to resubmit claims several times before payment is remitted and are primarily responsible for our aged receivables 
changes in the manner in which state agencies interpret program policies and procedures  and review and audit billings and costs could also affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and our ability to meet obligations under our indebtedness 
our cost structure and ultimate operating profitability are directly related to our labor costs 
labor costs may be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including limited availability of qualified personnel in each geographic area  local competitive forces  the ineffective utilization of our labor force  changes in minimum wages or other direct personnel costs  strikes or work stoppages by employees represented by labor unions  and changes in client services models  such as the trends toward supported living and managed care 
the difficulty experienced in hiring direct service staff and nursing staff in certain markets from time to time has resulted in higher labor costs in some of our operating units 
these higher labor costs are associated with increased overtime  recruitment and retention  training programs  and use of temporary staffing personnel and outside clinical consultants 
additionally  the maintenance and expansion of our operations depend on the continuation of trends toward downsizing  privatization and consolidation  and our ability to tailor our services to meet the specific needs of the populations we serve 
our success in a changing operational environment is subject to a variety of political  economic  social and legal pressures 
such pressures include a desire of governmental agencies to reduce costs and increase levels of services  federal  state and local budgetary constraints  and actions brought by advocacy groups and the courts to change existing service delivery systems 
material changes resulting from these trends and pressures could adversely affect the demand for and reimbursement of our services and our operating flexibility  and ultimately our revenues and profitability 

table of contents media coverage of the industry  including operators of facilities and programs for persons with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities  has from time to time included reports critical of the current trend toward privatization and of the operation of certain of these facilities and programs 
adverse media coverage about providers of these services in general  and us in particular  could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny in some areas  and could adversely affect our revenues and profitability by  among other things  adversely affecting our ability to obtain or retain contracts  discouraging government agencies from privatizing facilities and programs  increasing regulation and resulting compliance costs  or discouraging clients from using our services 
in recent years  changes in the market for insurance  particularly for professional and general liability coverage  have made it more difficult to obtain insurance coverage at reasonable rates 
the professional and general liability coverage provides for a million deductible per occurrence for policy year commencing july   and claims limits of million per occurrence up to a million annual aggregate limit 
our workers compensation coverage provides for a million deductible per occurrence  and claims up to statutory limits 
we utilize historical data to estimate our reserves for our insurance programs 
if losses on asserted claims exceed the current insurance coverage and accrued reserves  our business  results of operations  financial condition and ability to meet obligations under our indebtedness could be adversely affected 
the collection of accounts receivable is a significant management challenge and requires continual focus 
the limitations of some state information systems and procedures  such as the ability to obtain documentation timely from or disperse funds electronically  may limit the benefits we derive from our new system 
we must maintain or continue to improve our controls and procedures for managing our accounts receivable billing and collection activities if we are to collect our accounts receivable on a timely basis 
an inability to do so could adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations and maintain compliance with various financial covenants contained in our debt arrangements will depend on our future financial performance  which will be affected by a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy our debt obligations and maintain covenant compliance  we may have to undertake alternative financing plans  such as refinancing or restructuring our debt  selling assets  reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital 
we can provide no assurance that any refinancing would be possible  that any assets could be sold  or  if sold  of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales  or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  maintain covenant compliance or refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as on our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 
we must comply with comprehensive government regulation of our services  including statutes  regulations and policies governing the licensing of our facilities  certification of employees  the quality of our services  the revenues we receive for our services  and reimbursement for the cost of our services 
if we fail to comply with these laws  we can lose contracts and revenues  thereby harming our financial results 
state and federal regulatory agencies have broad discretionary powers over the administration and enforcement of laws and regulations that govern our operations 
we are currently experiencing increased regulatory oversight in the district of columbia and are working with the district agencies to address any issues 
a material violation of a law or regulation could subject us to fines and penalties and in some circumstances could disqualify some or all of the facilities and programs under our control from future participation in medicaid or other government programs 
we are currently experiencing increased regulatory oversight in the district of columbia and are working with the district agencies to address any issues 
hipaa could also increase potential penalties 
furthermore  future regulation or legislation affecting our programs may require us to change our operations significantly or incur increased costs 

table of contents our success in obtaining new contracts and renewals of our existing contracts depends upon maintaining our reputation as a quality service provider among governmental authorities  advocacy groups for persons with developmental disabilities and their families  and the public 
we also rely on government entities to refer clients to our facilities and programs 
negative publicity  changes in public perception  the actions of consumers under our care or investigations with respect to our industry  operations or policies could increase government scrutiny  increase compliance costs  hinder our ability to obtain or retain contracts  reduce referrals  discourage privatization of facilities and programs  and discourage clients from using our services 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition 
our management of residential  training  educational and support programs for our clients exposes us to potential claims or litigation by our clients or other persons for wrongful death  personal injury or other damages resulting from contact with our facilities  programs  personnel or other clients 
regulatory agencies may initiate administrative proceedings alleging violations of statutes and regulations arising from our programs and facilities and seeking to impose monetary penalties on us 
we could be required to pay substantial amounts of money to respond to regulatory investigations or  if we do not prevail  in damages or penalties arising from these legal proceedings and some awards of damages or penalties may not be covered by any insurance 
if our third party insurance coverage and self insurance reserves are not adequate to cover these claims  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 
expenses incurred under federal  state and local government agency contracts for any of our services  as well as management contracts with providers of record for such agencies  are subject to examination by agencies administering the contracts and services 
a negative outcome from any of these examinations could increase government scrutiny  increase compliance costs and hinder our ability to obtain or retain contracts 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition 
our revenues and net income may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  in part because annual medicaid rate adjustments may be announced by the various states at different times of the year and are usually retroactive to the beginning of the particular state s fiscal reporting period 
generally  future adjustments in reimbursement rates in most states will consist primarily of cost of living adjustments  adjustments based upon reported historical costs of operations  or other negotiated changes in rates 
however  many states in which we operate are experiencing budgetary pressures and certain of these states have initiated service reductions  or rate freezes and or rate reductions 
additionally  some states have  from time to time  revised their rate setting methodologies  which has resulted in rate decreases as well as rate increases 
however  in certain states  we have been successful in mitigating rate reductions by initiating programmatic changes that produce cost savings 
current initiatives at the federal or state level may materially change the medicaid program as it now exists 
future revenues may be affected by changes in rate setting structures  methodologies or interpretations that may be proposed or are under consideration in states where we operate 
also  some states have considered initiating managed care plans for persons currently in medicaid programs 
at this time  we cannot determine the impact of such changes  or the effect of various federal initiatives that have been proposed 
our facility and program expenses may also fluctuate from period to period  due in large part to changes in labor costs and insurance costs 
labor costs are affected by a number of factors  including the availability of qualified personnel  effective management of our programs  changes in service models  state budgetary pressures  severity of weather and other natural disasters 
our annual insurance costs and self insured retention limits have risen due in large part to the insurance market 
future revenues may be affected by changes in rate setting structures  methodologies or interpretations that may be proposed or are under consideration in states where we operate 
also  some states have considered initiating managed care plans for persons currently in medicaid programs 
at this time  we cannot determine the impact of such changes  or the effect of various federal initiatives that have been proposed 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk while we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our outstanding variable rate debt  we do not currently utilize any derivative financial instruments related to our interest rate exposure 
at december   we had variable rate debt outstanding of approximately million as compared to million outstanding at december  the variable rate debt outstanding principally relates to the term loan which has an interest rate based on margins over libor or prime  tiered based upon leverage calculations 
an increase in the interest rate of basis points on the debt balance outstanding as of december   would increase interest expense approximately million annually
