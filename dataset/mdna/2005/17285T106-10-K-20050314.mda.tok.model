the market assignments on this table reflect the way we cluster our regional station groups for accounting and operational purposes and do not necessarily mean that the station is located in the market as defined by arbitron or the fcc 
compliance with the fcc s local radio ownership limits is measured by reference to the number of stations a company holds in a particular market as that market is defined by the fcc 
for a discussion of the impact of the new fcc rules on us and our station clusters  see federal regulation of radio broadcasting multiple ownership rules and federal regulation of radio broadcasting time brokerage 
in addition to the stations listed in this table  we entered into an option agreement on november  to acquire one fm station serving the oklahoma city  ok market and are currently operating this station under a local marketing agreement 
on july   we entered into a local marketing agreement related to a radio station in knoxville  tn 
on december   we entered into local marketing agreements to operate four 
table of contents stations in the muskegon  mi market pending the completion of our acquisition of those stations 
on january   we entered into a local marketing agreement to operate one station in the birmingham  al market and six stations in the tuscaloosa  al market commencing march  pending the completion of our acquisition of those stations 
some of our local marketing agreements and joint sales agreements do not comply with the fcc s new ownership limits 
we will be required to terminate these agreements or otherwise come into compliance with the fcc s ownership rules no later than two years after the fcc s new rules become effective 
we do not believe that termination of these agreements or our actions to come into compliance with the new rules with respect to these agreements will have a material impact on our business or our results of operations 
the station group audience share rank is the ranking of our station group among all station groups within the demographic of people ages  listening monday through sunday  am to midnight based upon the total station group s audience share in that market 
the station group revenue rank is the ranking  by station group market revenue  of our station group among all station groups in that market 
includes radio stations in our kokomo  in and presque isle  me markets  which are not rated by arbitron 
market and industry data we based or derived the station and market data we present in this form k from third party sources 
unless otherwise indicated we derived all audience share data and audience ranking information from surveys of people ages  listening monday through sunday  am to midnight  pertaining to each market  based on the fall market report published by the arbitron ratings company  and we derived our station group revenue ranking information for the full year  our market revenue rank  the number of owned and operated stations in the market and the number of station groups in the market from bia financial network  inc s biafn s media access pro as of january  while we believe these industry publications are reliable  we have not independently verified them 
operating strategy operate and develop leading station clusters 
we believe that it is important to own multiple stations in each of the markets in which we operate in order to maximize our ability to achieve leadership positions  increase operating efficiencies and compete more effectively with other forms of local media 
we rank first or second in audience share in of our rated markets 
our stations cover a wide range of programming formats  geographic regions  audience demographics and advertising clients 
emphasize programming 
we analyze market research and competitive factors to identify the key programming attributes that we believe will best position each station to develop a distinctive identity  or a local brand  and to maximize its appeal to local audiences and advertisers 
our programming strategy includes developing or contracting with significant on air talent  creating recognizable brand names for selected stations 
we believe this strategy significantly enhances the presence  marketability and competitiveness of our stations  leading to greater audience share and consequently higher revenues and operating income excluding non cash expenses depreciation  amortization and amortization of non cash stock compensation 
build geographic  format and customer diversity 
we seek to diversify our portfolio of radio stations in many respects 
our stations are located in markets throughout the country and serve diverse target demographics through a broad range of programming formats such as rock  country  adult contemporary  oldies  urban and sports news talk 
this diversity reduces our dependence on any particular local economy  market  station  format  on air personality or advertiser 
similarly  we seek to develop a broad base of local and regional advertisers 
during the year ended december   we generated approximately of our net broadcasting revenue from local and regional advertising and approximately from the sale of national advertising 
no single advertiser accounted for more than of our net broadcasting revenue 

table of contents apply improved sales and marketing to capture greater share of advertising revenues 
the development of a high quality local sales organization in each of our markets is critical to our success 
we rank first or second in revenue market share in of our ranked markets 
in each market  we assess our station portfolio  the local market environment and the strength of our sales personnel to determine whether to pursue a cluster sale strategy or to create a separate sales force for each station 
we place significant emphasis on recruiting quality sales people  setting clear financial and sales goals and rewarding achievement of those goals with generous commissions and bonus compensation 
we also target regional sales  which we define as sales in regions surrounding our markets to companies that advertise in our markets  through our local sales force 
we reach national advertisers in partnership with a national representative firm  offering advertising time on individual stations or across our overall network of stations 
participate in local communities 
as a local sales and advertising medium  we place significant emphasis on serving the local community 
we believe our active involvement reinforces our position in the local communities and significantly improves the marketability of our radio broadcast time to advertisers who are targeting these communities 
optimize technical capabilities 
we believe that a strong signal is an important component of a station s success 
we seek to operate stations with the strongest signals in their respective markets and view signal strength as an important consideration in any acquisitions we make 
acquisition strategy our current acquisition strategy focuses on identifying and acquiring radio stations that would expand our station clusters in existing and contiguous markets  as well as provide us entry into new markets that generally rank in the top based on total market revenue 
we seek to implement effective operating strategies and apply our infrastructure across all existing and acquired stations to improve the operating income excluding non cash expenses of acquired stations compared to their performance under prior ownership 
we also seek to gradually dispose of non core radio stations that do not complement our overall strategy 
in analyzing acquisition opportunities  we consider the following criteria our ability to improve the operating performance of the stations  our ability to acquire a new or improve an existing cluster of stations towards achieving a higher share of revenue in the market  the number and quality of competing commercial radio signals  as well as the number and nature of competitors  in the market  the power and quality of the stations broadcasting signals  and the general economic conditions in the market 
we believe our acquisition strategy affords a number of benefits  including the development of a broad  geographically diversified footprint that allows us to deliver advertising on a local  regional and national basis  to create revenue diversity  improved margins through the improvement of operations of acquired stations  the consolidation of facilities and the elimination of redundant expenses  enhanced revenues by offering advertisers a broad range of advertising packages  by clustering our stations  and enhanced appeal to more skilled industry management talent as we achieve market leading positions and national scale 
all of our acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as such  the results of operations of the acquired stations have been included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
for acquisitions during  and  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii of this report 

table of contents competition we operate in a highly competitive industry 
our radio stations compete for audiences and advertising revenue directly with other radio stations as well as with other media  such as broadcast television  newspapers  magazines  cable television  satellite television  satellite radio  the internet  outdoor advertising and direct mail  within their respective markets 
our audience ratings and market shares are subject to change and any adverse change in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on our revenue in that market and possibly adversely affect our revenue in other markets 
our radio stations compete for listeners and advertising revenue directly with other radio stations within their respective markets 
radio stations compete for listeners primarily on the basis of program content that appeals to a particular demographic group 
by building a strong listener base consisting of a specific demographic group in each of our markets  we are able to attract advertisers seeking to reach those listeners 
from time to time  competitors may change their stations format or programming to compete directly with our stations for audiences and advertisers  or may engage in aggressive promotional campaigns  which could result in lower ratings and advertising revenue or increased promotion and other expenses and  consequently  lower earnings and cash flow for us 
audience preferences as to format or programming in a particular market may also shift due to demographic or other reasons 
factors that are material to a radio station s competitive position include management experience  the station s audience rank in its local market  transmitter power  assigned frequency  audience characteristics  local program acceptance and the number and characteristics of other radio stations in the market area 
we attempt to improve our competitive position in each market by researching stations programming  implementing advertising and promotional campaigns aimed at the demographic groups for which our stations program and managing our sales efforts to attract a larger share of advertising revenue 
we also compete with other radio station groups to purchase additional stations 
although the radio broadcasting industry is highly competitive  barriers to entry do exist which can be mitigated to some extent by  among other things  changing existing radio station formats and upgrading power 
the operation of a radio station requires a license or other authorization from the fcc federal communications commission  and the number of radio stations that can operate in a given market is limited by the availability of fm and am radio frequencies allotted by the fcc to communities in that market 
in addition  the fcc s multiple ownership rules have historically limited the number of stations that may be owned or controlled by a single entity in a given market 
changes in the fcc s multiple ownership rules resulting from the telecommunications act of created opportunities for us to acquire and consolidate radio stations in our markets 
on june   the fcc concluded an omnibus rulemaking proceeding in which it examined all broadcast ownership rules  including the local radio ownership rule  the broadcast newspaper ownership rule  the radio television cross ownership rule  the local television ownership rule  the national television ownership rule and the dual network rule 
the fcc adopted new rules that significantly change how the fcc reviews radio station transactions 
although the fcc made no change to the local radio ownership limits themselves ie  in a market with or more radio stations  a company may own eight stations in a single market  but no more than five in the same service  am or fm  the fcc changed how it defines and counts the number of stations in a market 
the rule change has the effect in some instances of both i decreasing the number of radio stations deemed to be in the market overall  thereby lowering the applicable ownership tier  and ii increasing the number of radio stations that we are deemed to own in the market 
under the new rule  our existing station portfolio will exceed the applicable ownership limit in nine markets 
existing ownership combinations  however  are grandfathered  meaning the fcc will not require us to divest stations that we currently own in order to come into compliance with the new rules 
the new rule also affects our ability to expand our ownership in certain markets 
we may be required to divest one station or obtain a waiver in order to obtain fcc approval to consummate a pending transaction in one market 
we do not believe this divestiture  if required  would be material to our business or acquisition strategy 
the new rules were to become effective on september   but were stayed by the us court of appeals for the third circuit on september  pending the outcome of appeals filed by several entities 
a number of parties also filed requests with the fcc seeking reconsideration of certain aspects of the new rules 
on 
table of contents september   the third circuit issued an order granting in part a request filed by the fcc to partially lift the court s stay 
the order permitted the new local radio ownership rules adopted june  to go into effect 
there was significant congressional opposition to the new rules  and bills were introduced in the last session of congress to modify or repeal the fcc s action  including a requirement that companies divest stations to come into compliance with the revised rules 
we cannot assess in advance what impact such court and administrative proceedings and legislation might have on our business or what other matters might be considered in the future by the fcc or congress 
for a discussion of fcc regulation and the provisions of the telecommunications act of resulting in rapid consolidation in the radio industry  see federal regulation of radio broadcasting 
the radio broadcasting industry is also subject to technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies 
several new media technologies have been or are being developed  including the following audio programming by cable television systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  internet content providers both landline and wireless and other digital audio broadcast formats  satellite digital audio radio service  which now has two subscriber based satellite radio services with numerous channels and sound quality equivalent to that of compact discs  in band on channel digital radio  which could improve the quality of existing am and fm radio signals  including stations owned by us  and low power fm radio  which has resulted in additional fm radio broadcast outlets that are designed to serve small  localized areas 
the radio broadcasting industry historically has grown despite the introduction of new technologies for the delivery of entertainment and information  including the introduction of new technologies used in the car such as audio cassettes  compact discs and cellular telephones 
a growing population  greater use of the automobile and increased commuter times have contributed to this growth 
some of the new technologies  particularly satellite digital audio radio service  will compete for the consumer s attention in the car 
we cannot assure you that this historical growth will continue 
federal regulation of radio broadcasting our ownership  operation  purchase and sale of radio stations is regulated by the fcc  which acts under authority derived from the communications act 
among other things  the fcc assigns frequency bands for broadcasting  determines the particular frequencies  locations  operating powers and other technical parameters of stations  issues  renews  revokes and modifies station licenses  determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of station licenses  regulates equipment used by stations  and adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership  operation and employment practices of stations 
the fcc has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules or the communications act  including fines  the grant of abbreviated license renewal terms or  for particularly egregious violations  the denial of a license renewal application  the revocation of a license or the denial of fcc consent to acquire additional radio stations 
the following is a brief summary of some provisions of the communications act and of specific fcc regulations and policies 
the summary is not a comprehensive listing of all of the regulations and policies affecting radio stations 
for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio stations  you should refer to the communications act  fcc rules and fcc public notices and rulings 

table of contents license grant and renewal radio stations operate under renewable broadcasting licenses that are ordinarily granted by the fcc for maximum terms of eight years 
licenses are renewed through an application to the fcc 
a station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a timely filed license application is pending 
petitions to deny license renewals can be filed by interested parties  including members of the public 
these petitions may raise various issues before the fcc 
the fcc is required to hold hearings on renewal applications if the fcc is unable to determine that renewal of a license would serve the public interest  convenience and necessity  or if a petition to deny raises a substantial and material question of fact as to whether the grant of the renewal application would be inconsistent with the public interest  convenience and necessity 
if  as a result of an evidentiary hearing  the fcc determines that the licensee has failed to meet various requirements and that no mitigating factors justify the imposition of a lesser sanction  then the fcc may deny a license renewal application 
historically  fcc licenses have generally been renewed  although we cannot assure you that all of our licenses will be renewed 
the non renewal  or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications  of one or more of our fcc radio station licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the fcc classifies each am and fm station 
an am station operates on either a clear channel  regional channel or local channel 
a clear channel is one on which am stations are assigned to serve wide areas 
clear channel am stations are classified as either class a stations  which operate on an unlimited time basis and are designed to render primary and secondary service over an extended area  class b stations  which operate on an unlimited time basis and are designed to render service only over a primary service area  or class d stations  which operate either during daytime hours only  during limited times only or on an unlimited time basis with low nighttime power 
a regional channel is one on which class b and class d am stations may operate and serve primarily a principal center of population and the rural areas contiguous to it 
a local channel is one on which am stations operate on an unlimited time basis and serve primarily a community and the suburban and rural areas immediately contiguous to it 
class c am stations operate on a local channel and are designed to render service only over a primary service area that may be reduced as a consequence of interference 
the minimum and maximum facilities requirements for an fm station are determined by its class 
some fm class designations depend upon the geographic zone in which the transmitter of the fm station is located 
in general  commercial fm stations are classified as class a  b  c  b  c  c  c and c  in order of increasing power and antenna height 
the fcc recently adopted a rule that subjects class c fm stations to involuntary downgrades to class c in various circumstances if they do not meet certain antenna height specifications 
three of our stations have recently been downgraded  and a few proceedings are pending that could result in downgrades but the downgrades have no effect on the stations existing signals 
we have several applications currently pending to upgrade the facilities of various of our stations 

table of contents the following table sets forth the metropolitan market served the city of license may differ  call letters  fcc license classification  frequency  power and fcc license expiration date of each of the stations that we own 
our wholly owned subsidiary  citadel broadcasting company  holds our licenses 
pursuant to fcc rules and regulations  many am radio stations are licensed to operate at a reduced power during the nighttime broadcasting hours  which results in reducing the radio station s coverage during the nighttime hours of operation 
both power ratings are shown if different 
for fm stations  the maximum effective radiated power erp in the main lobe is given

in determining whether to grant approval  the fcc considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee and proposed licensee  including compliance with the various rules and policies limiting common ownership of media properties in a given market  the character of the licensee and those persons holding attributable interests in the licensee  and compliance with the communications act s limitations on alien ownership  as well as compliance with other fcc regulations and policies 
to obtain fcc consent to assign a broadcast license or transfer control of a broadcast licensee  appropriate applications must be filed with the fcc 
if the application involves a substantial change in ownership or control  the application must be placed on public notice for not less than days during which time interested parties  including listeners  advertisers and competitors  may file petitions to deny or other objections against the application 
these types of petitions are filed from time to time with respect to proposed acquisitions 
informal objections to assignment and transfer of control applications may be filed at any time up until the fcc acts on the application 
once the fcc staff grants an application  interested parties may seek reconsideration of that grant for days  after which time the fcc may for another ten days reconsider the grant of the fcc staff on the 
table of contents fcc s own motion 
if the application does not involve a substantial change in ownership or control  it is a pro forma application 
the pro forma application is nevertheless subject to having informal objections filed against it 
when passing on an assignment or transfer application  the fcc is prohibited from considering whether the public interest might be served by an assignment or transfer of the broadcast license to any party other than the assignee or transferee specified in the application 
multiple ownership rules the fcc rules impose specific limits on the number of commercial radio stations an entity can own in a particular geographic area 
these local radio ownership rules preclude us from acquiring certain stations we might otherwise seek to acquire 
the rules also effectively prevent us from selling stations in an area to a buyer that has reached its ownership limit in the market unless the buyer divests other stations 
the local radio ownership rules are as follows in markets with or more radio stations  ownership is limited to eight commercial stations  no more than five of which can be either am or fm  in markets with to radio stations  ownership is limited to seven commercial stations  no more than four of which can be either am or fm  in markets with to radio stations  ownership is limited to six commercial stations  no more than four of which can be either am or fm  and in markets with or fewer radio stations  ownership is limited to five commercial stations or no more than of the market s total  whichever is lower  and no more than three of which can be either am or fm 
on june   the fcc concluded an omnibus rulemaking proceeding in which it examined all broadcast ownership rules  including the local radio ownership rule  the broadcast newspaper ownership rule  the radio television cross ownership rule  the local television ownership rule  the national television ownership rule and the dual network rule 
with respect to radio  the fcc retained the specific limits on the number of commercial radio stations an entity can own in a particular geographic market 
the fcc  however  changed the way it defines the relevant geographic market and counts the number of stations in that market 
the fcc abandoned the signal contour method of defining the market for radio stations that are located in areas where arbitron ranks stations 
these geographic areas are called arbitron metros 
under the new rules  the fcc determines the number of radio stations in an arbitron metro  for purposes of determining the ownership limit  by counting all commercial and non commercial radio stations licensed to communities within the arbitron metro  plus all radio stations licensed to communities located outside of the metro but treated by arbitron as home to the metro 
unlike under the previous rules  both commercial and non commercial stations are counted in determining the number of stations in a market 
the fcc uses the same methodology to determine the number of stations that a single company is deemed to own or control  directly or by attribution 
for radio stations located outside of an arbitron metro  the fcc will continue to use its previous signal contour based methodology  with two modifications 
the fcc also initiated a new rulemaking proceeding to develop a new method of defining markets located outside of arbitron metros 
we own a few radio stations in unrated markets 
we do not believe that the fcc s rule changes as they apply to unrated markets will have any material effect on our business plan 
the fcc s rule changes as they apply to radio stations in arbitron metros have several potential adverse effects 
in some markets  the new rules have the effect of both i decreasing the number of radio stations deemed to be in the market overall  thereby lowering the applicable ownership tier  and ii increasing the number of radio stations that we are deemed to own in the market 
for example  the number of overall stations in some of our markets will be reduced from or more to fewer than  thereby reducing the applicable ownership limit from eight radio stations  no more than five of which may be am or fm  to seven radio stations  no more than four of which may be am or fm 
in addition  in several markets  we will be deemed to own or control more radio stations than we were deemed to own or control under the old rules 

table of contents our existing station portfolio exceeds the applicable ownership limit under the new arbitron metro rule by approximately twelve stations in nine markets 
furthermore  some of our existing station portfolio may be subject to compliance with both the arbitron metro based rule and the modified signal contour methodology 
it is not yet clear how the fcc will apply its new ownership rules in this situation 
under the new rules  however  we will not be required to divest existing owned stations in order to come into compliance with the new limits 
instead  existing ownership combinations are grandfathered 
divestitures will be required only if we seek to transfer control of the stations or we attempt to acquire additional stations in the market 
the fcc s rules contain an exception to the divestiture requirement in the case of transfers to small businesses as defined by the fcc 
the rules also contain an exception to the divestiture requirement in the case of pro forma transfers of control  which we believe would apply in the event of any transfer of control that may be deemed to occur if as a result of future offerings by us or sales by the forstmann little partnerships  the forstmann little partnerships cease to own a controlling interest in us  or  there is a change in control of the forstmann little partnerships  provided that no other person acquires control 
under the fcc s current rules  radio stations that are operated under local marketing agreements may be treated as owned for purposes of the local radio ownership limit 
see time brokerage 
the new rules extend this treatment to certain joint sales agreements 
some of our existing local marketing agreements and joint sales agreements do not comply with the new local radio ownership rule 
unlike existing ownership combinations  non compliant joint sales agreements and local marketing agreements are not permanently grandfathered  but must be terminated  if non compliant  no later than two years after the new rules become effective 
the fcc also eliminated the cross ownership rules that limited or prohibited radio station ownership by the owner of television stations or a daily newspaper in the same market and replaced these rules with a new cross media rule 
under the new cross media rule  the following limits apply in markets with three or fewer tv stations  no cross ownership is permitted among tv  radio and newspapers  although a company may request a waiver if it can show that the tv station does not serve the area served by the cross owned property ie the radio station or newspaper  in markets with between four and eight tv stations  combinations are limited to one of the following a daily newspaper  one tv station  and up to half of the radio station limit for that market  or a daily newspaper  and up to the radio station limit for that market  but no tv stations  or two tv stations if permissible under the local tv ownership rule  and up to the radio station limit for that market  but no daily newspapers 
in markets with nine or more tv stations  the fcc eliminated the newspaper broadcast cross ownership ban and the television radio cross ownership ban 
the new rules were to become effective on september   but were stayed by the us court of appeals for the third circuit on september  pending the outcome of appeals filed by several entities 
a number of parties also filed requests with the fcc seeking reconsideration of certain aspects of the new rules 
on september   the third circuit issued an order granting in part a request filed by the fcc to partially lift the court s stay 
the order permitted the new local radio ownership rules adopted june  to go into effect 
there is significant congressional opposition to the new rules  and bills were introduced in the last session of congress  st session to modify or repeal the fcc s action  including a requirement that companies divest stations to come into compliance with the revised rules 
at this time  it is uncertain whether any potential congressional proposals will become law or what effect such legislation will have on us and our ability to acquire additional stations 
if a requirement that companies divest stations to come into compliance with the arbitron based geographic market approach for defining local radio markets were to become law  we would be required to divest approximately twelve stations in nine markets 
we have evaluated the potential impact of this divestiture requirement and we believe that the required divestitures would not have a materially adverse effect on us as a whole  because we could come into compliance by divesting underperforming or technically inferior stations  and divestitures may have the effect of leveling the competitive 
table of contents playing field in markets where existing competitors own radio stations in excess of the new limits 
in addition  the requirement that other companies divest stations may create acquisition opportunities for us in other markets 
ownership attribution rules the fcc s multiple ownership rules apply to attributable interests in broadcast stations or daily newspapers held by an individual  corporation  partnership or other association 
in the case of corporations directly or indirectly controlling broadcast licenses  the interests of officers  directors and those who  directly or indirectly  have the right to vote or more of the corporation s voting stock are generally attributable 
some passive investors are attributable only if they hold or more of the corporation s voting stock 
however  all minority shareholder interests other than interests subject to the debt equity rule discussed in the next paragraph are exempt from attribution if a single shareholder controls a majority of the voting shares in the corporation 
although the fcc had previously revoked the single majority shareholder exemption  on december   following a court decision that found the fcc s elimination of the exemption in the context of the fcc s cable ownership attribution rules to be arbitrary and capricious  the fcc suspended enforcement of the elimination of the exemption pending the outcome of a rulemaking to reconsider this matter 
notwithstanding the presence of a single majority shareholder  the fcc will attribute the interests of various creditors or investors in a corporation under the so called debt equity plus rule 
under this rule  a major programming supplier or a same market owner will be treated as an attributable owner of a station if the supplier or owner holds debt or equity  or both  in the station that is greater than of the value of the station s total debt plus equity 
a major programming supplier includes any programming supplier that provides more than of the station s weekly programming hours 
a same market owner includes any attributable owner of a media company  including broadcast stations  cable television  and newspapers  located in the same market as the station  but only if the owner is attributable under an fcc attribution rule other than the debt equity plus rule 
the attribution rules could limit the number of radio stations we may acquire or own in any market and may also limit the ability of various potential buyers of stations owned by us from being able to purchase some or all of the stations that they might otherwise wish to purchase from us 
to address the possibility that attributable interests held by minority shareholders could limit our ability to acquire stations  our certificate of incorporation provides that our capital stock is subject to redemption by action of our board of directors to the extent necessary to bring us into compliance with the fcc s ownership rules 
alien ownership rules the communications act prohibits the issuance or holding of broadcast licenses by aliens  including any corporation if more than of its capital stock is collectively owned or voted by aliens 
in addition  the fcc may prohibit any corporation from holding a broadcast license if the corporation is directly or indirectly controlled by any other corporation of which more than of the capital stock is owned of record or voted by aliens  if the fcc finds that the prohibition is in the public interest 
the fcc has interpreted this provision of the communications act to require an affirmative public interest finding before a broadcast license may be granted to or held by any such corporation  and the fcc has made such affirmative findings only in limited circumstances 
these restrictions apply in similar fashion to other forms of businesses and organizations  including partnerships and limited liability companies 
our certificate of incorporation provides that our capital stock is subject to redemption by action of our board of directors to the extent necessary to bring us into compliance with the communications act or fcc regulations or prevent the loss of any of our fcc licenses 
time brokerage over the years  a number of radio stations have entered into what have commonly been referred to as time brokerage agreements or local marketing agreements 
while these agreements may take varying forms  under a typical time brokerage agreement  separately owned and licensed radio stations agree to enter into cooperative arrangements of varying sorts  subject to compliance with the requirements of antitrust laws and with the fcc s rules and policies 
under these arrangements  separately owned stations could agree to function cooperatively in programming  advertising sales and similar matters  subject to the requirement that the licensee of each station 
table of contents maintain independent control over the programming and operations of its own station 
one typical type of time brokerage agreement is a programming agreement between two separately owned radio stations serving a common service area  whereby the licensee of one station provides substantial portions of the broadcast programming for airing on the other licensee s station  subject to ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter licensee  and sells advertising time during those program segments 
the fcc s rules provide that a radio station that brokers more than of its weekly broadcast time on another station serving the same market will be considered to have an attributable ownership interest in the brokered station for purposes of the fcc s multiple ownership rules 
as a result  in a market where we own a radio station  we would not be permitted to enter into a time brokerage agreement with another local radio station in the same market that we could not own under the local ownership rules  unless our programming on the brokered station constituted or less of the other local station s programming time on a weekly basis 
fcc rules also prohibit a radio station from duplicating more than of its programming on another station in the same broadcast service ie  am am or fm fm directly or through a time brokerage agreement where the brokered and brokering stations that it owns or programs serve substantially the same area 
the fcc s new ownership rules extend ownership attribution to certain joint sales agreements as well 
see multiple ownership rules 
under a joint sales agreement  one radio station sells the commercial time on a separately owned and licensed radio station  but does not provide programming as under a time brokerage or local marketing agreement 
a radio station that sells more than of the advertising time of another radio station in the same market will be considered to have an attributable ownership interest in the other station for purposes of the fcc s multiple ownership rules 
in its september  order  the third circuit lifted the stay on this new requirement making such joint sales agreements attributable 
as a result  we will no longer be able to enter into a joint sales agreement providing for the sale of more than of the advertising time of another radio station that we could not own 
under the fcc s new ownership rules  companies have two years to terminate non compliant time brokerage and joint sales agreements or otherwise come into compliance with the new limits 
we do not believe that termination of these agreements or our actions to come into compliance with the new rules with respect to these agreements will have a material impact on our business or our results of operations 
programming and operation the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest 
since  the fcc gradually has relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it developed to promote the broadcast of types of programming responsive to the needs of a station s community of license 
however  licensees continue to be required to present programming that is responsive to community problems  needs and interests and to maintain records demonstrating responsiveness 
complaints from listeners concerning a station s programming will be considered by the fcc when it evaluates the licensee s renewal application  although listener complaints may be filed and considered at any time and must be maintained in the station s public file 
stations also must pay regulatory and application fees and follow various fcc rules that regulate  among other things  political advertising  the broadcast of obscene or indecent programming  the advertisement of casinos and lotteries  sponsorship identification and technical operations  including limits on radio frequency radiation 
the fcc adopted new equal employment opportunity eeo rules for broadcasters which became effective march  the new rules are outreach and recruitment focused and require that broadcasters widely disseminate information for each full time job vacancy  except for vacancies filled in exigent circumstances  provide notification to community and recruitment organizations that have requested information on all or selected job vacancies  and participate in longer term recruitment initiatives  such as job fairs  internships  scholarships and eeo anti discrimination training programs 
broadcasters remain subject to the fcc s anti discrimination policy but the use of minority or women targeted recruitment sources is no longer mandated 
the new rules also require a broadcaster to keep extensive internal records regarding its recruitment efforts including information regarding its recruitment sources and interviewees  notification to requesting community groups and specifics regarding participation in the longer term initiatives 
broadcasters must also prepare and place in the public inspection file and on their website if they maintain one an annual eeo public file report that details recruitment efforts and interviewee totals  the referral sources used for each vacancy  the community groups 
table of contents notified  and specifics regarding participation in longer term recruitment initiatives 
broadcasters are subject to an fcc mid term review in the fourth year of the license term and an fcc review as part of the license renewal application  both requiring the submission of the annual eeo public file report for the preceding two years with a statement certifying that the broadcaster s reports are accurate 
the fcc is expected to address the annual workforce employment information and filing requirements in a separate report and order 
also pending is the fcc s review of recruitment requirements for part time vacancies and it issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking in conjunction with the new rules to solicit public comment on this issue 
the fcc has issued a decision holding that a broadcast station may not deny a candidate for federal political office a request for broadcast advertising time solely on the grounds that the amount of time requested is not the standard length of time which the station offers to its commercial advertisers 
the effect that this fcc decision will have on our programming and commercial advertising is uncertain at this time 
periodically  we may be required to obtain special temporary authority sta from the fcc to operate one or more of the stations in a manner different from the licensed parameters so that we can complete scheduled construction or maintenance or so that we may repair damaged or broken equipment without interrupting service 
we are currently operating some stations under stas in the ordinary course of business 
in the ordinary course of business  we have received complaints or the fcc has initiated inquiries about whether we have broadcast indecent programming or violated technical requirements 
indecency regulation the fcc s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent material between the hours of am and pm 
broadcasters risk violating the prohibition on the broadcast of indecent material because of the vagueness of the fcc s definition of indecent material  coupled with the spontaneity of live programming 
the fcc in the last few years has stepped up its enforcement activities as they apply to indecency  and has threatened to initiate license revocation or license renewal proceedings against broadcast licensees for a category of undefined serious indecency violations 
the fcc has also expanded the breadth of indecency regulation to include material that could be considered blasphemy  personally reviling epithets  profanity and vulgar or coarse words amounting to a nuisance 
legislation has also been introduced in congress that would increase the penalties for broadcasting indecent programming  and depending on the number of violations engaged in  would potentially subject broadcasters to license revocation  renewal or qualifications proceedings in the event that they broadcast indecent material 
we have one outstanding indecency proceeding against our station in albuquerque  nm 
the pendancy of this proceeding  as well as the fcc s more vigorous enforcement of its indecency rules  may encourage third parties to challenge our license renewal or assignment applications 
proposed and recent changes congress  the fcc or other federal agencies may in the future consider and adopt new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could  directly or indirectly  affect the operation  ownership and profitability of our radio stations  result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenue for our radio stations  and affect our ability to acquire additional radio stations or finance acquisitions 
these matters include changes in the fcc s ownership rules and policies  including changes to the local radio ownership rules and the limitations on the cross ownership of radio and other media see multiple ownership rules  proposals to increase regulatory fees or to impose spectrum use or other fees on fcc licensees  technical and frequency allocation matters and changes to broadcast technical requirements  proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of beer  wine and other alcoholic beverages  proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of on line casinos or on line sports betting services  proposals to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenses by advertisers  restatement in revised form of fcc s equal employment opportunity rules and revision to rules relating to political broadcasting  
table of contents proposals to regulate or prohibit payments to stations by independent record promoters  and proposals to shorten the term of broadcasting licenses from eight to three years 
the fcc recently selected in band  on channel technology as the exclusive standard for digital services for terrestrial am and fm broadcasters 
the fcc has authorized the immediate commencement of hybrid transmissions simultaneous transmissions in both analog and digital pending the adoption of formal licensing and service rules  using in band  on channel systems for fm stations 
tests of the in band  on channel technology for am stations are ongoing and hybrid transmissions for am stations have not yet been authorized 
digital audio broadcasting s advantages over traditional analog broadcasting technology include improved sound quality and the ability to offer a greater variety of auxiliary services 
in band  on channel technology will permit radio stations to transmit radio programming in both analog and digital formats  and eventually in digital only formats  using the bandwidth that the radio station is currently licensed to use 
it is unclear what formal licensing and service rules the fcc will adopt regarding digital audio broadcasting and what effect these regulations will have on our business or the operations of our stations 
in january  the fcc created a new low power fm radio service 
the new low power stations operate at a maximum power of between ten and watts in the existing fm commercial and non commercial band 
low power stations may be used by governmental and non profit organizations to provide non commercial educational programming or public safety and transportation radio services 
no existing broadcaster or other media entity is permitted to have an ownership interest or enter into any program or operating agreement with any low power fm station 
during the first two years of the new service  applicants must be based in the area that they propose to serve 
applicants are not permitted to own more than one station nationwide during the initial two year period 
after the initial two year period  entities are allowed to own up to five stations nationwide  and after three years  the limit will be raised to ten stations nationwide 
a single person or entity may not own two low power stations whose transmitters are less than seven miles from each other 
the authorizations for the new stations are not transferable 
in april  the fcc adopted a third channel interference protection standard  and prohibited any applicant from obtaining a low power fm station who has previously operated a station without a license 
at this time it is difficult to assess the competitive impact of these new stations 
although the new low power stations must comply with certain technical requirements aimed at protecting existing fm radio stations from interference  we cannot be certain of the level of interference that low power stations will cause after they begin operating 
moreover  if low power fm stations are licensed in the markets in which we operate  the low power stations may compete with us for listeners 
the low power stations may also limit our ability to obtain new licenses or to modify our existing facilities  or cause interference to areas of existing service that are not protected by the fcc s rules  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
we cannot predict what other matters might be considered in the future by the fcc or congress  nor can we judge in advance what impact  if any  the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business 
federal antitrust considerations the federal trade commission and the department of justice  which evaluate transactions to determine whether those transactions should be challenged under the federal antitrust laws  have been increasingly active recently in their review of radio station acquisitions  particularly where an operator proposes to acquire additional stations in its existing markets 
for an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds  the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended  and the rules promulgated thereunder  require the parties to file notification and report forms with the federal trade commission and the department of justice and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition 
during the initial day period after the filing  the agencies decide which of them will investigate the transaction 
if the investigating agency determines that the transaction does not raise significant antitrust issues  then it will either terminate the waiting period or allow it to expire after the initial days 
on the other hand  if the agency determines that the transaction requires a more detailed investigation  then  at the conclusion of the initial day period  it will issue a formal request for additional 
table of contents information 
the issuance of a formal request extends the waiting period until the th calendar day after the date of substantial compliance by all parties to the acquisition 
thereafter  the waiting period may only be extended by court order or with the consent of the parties 
in practice  complying with a formal request can take a significant amount of time 
in addition  if the investigating agency raises substantive issues in connection with a proposed transaction  then the parties frequently engage in lengthy discussions or negotiations with the investigating agency concerning possible means of addressing those issues  including persuading the agency that the proposed acquisition would not violate the antitrust laws  restructuring the proposed acquisition  divestiture of other assets of one or more parties  or abandonment of the transaction 
these discussions and negotiations can be time consuming  and the parties may agree to delay completion of the acquisition during their pendency 
at any time before or after the completion of a proposed acquisition  the federal trade commission or the department of justice could take action under the antitrust laws as it considers necessary or desirable in the public interest  including seeking to enjoin the acquisition or seeking divestiture of the business or other assets acquired 
acquisitions that are not required to be reported under the hart scott rodino act may be investigated by the federal trade commission or the department of justice under the antitrust laws before or after completion 
in addition  private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws 
as part of its increased scrutiny of radio station acquisitions  the department of justice has stated publicly that it believes that commencement of operations under time brokerage agreements  local marketing agreements  joint sales agreements and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station transfers prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino act could violate the hart scott rodino act 
in connection with acquisitions subject to the waiting period under the hart scott rodino act  so long as the department of justice policy on the issue remains unchanged  we would not expect to commence operation of any affected station to be acquired under a time brokerage agreement  local marketing agreement or similar agreement until the waiting period has expired or been terminated 
environmental as the owner  lessee  or operator of various real properties and facilities  we are subject to various federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations 
historically  compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business 
there can be no assurance  however  that compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations will not require us to make significant expenditures of funds 
seasonality in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenue is lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year and highest in the second and fourth calendar quarters of the year 
employees as of december   we had  full time employees and  part time employees 
none of these employees is covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our relations with our employees generally to be good 
we employ several on air personalities in our respective markets 
we enter into employment agreements with certain on air personalities in order to protect our interests in these employee relationships 
we do not believe that the loss of any one of these on air personalities would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations

risk factors the following factors in addition to others could have a material impact on our business decreased spending by advertisers can adversely affect our advertising revenue 
since virtually all of our revenue is generated from the sale of local  regional and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations  a recession or downturn in the united states economy could have an adverse effect on us as advertisers generally reduce their spending during economic downturns 
in addition  because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from local advertisers  our ability to generate advertising revenue in specific markets could be adversely affected by local or regional economic downturns 
for example  in  due to weakness in the general advertising sector and in our markets  which was further exacerbated by the events of september  our pro forma net broadcasting revenue declined we may lose audience share and advertising revenue to competing radio stations or other types of media competitors 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
our radio stations compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other radio stations and station groups  as well as with other media such as broadcast television  newspapers  magazines  cable television  satellite television  satellite radio  outdoor advertising  the internet  hand held programmable devices  such as ipods and direct mail 
audience ratings and market shares are subject to change 
any adverse change in a particular market  or adverse change in the relative market positions of the stations located in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on our revenue or ratings  could require increased promotion or other expenses in that market  and could adversely affect our revenue in other markets 
other radio broadcasting companies may enter the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future 
these companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we have 
our radio stations may not be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenue 
in addition  from time to time  other stations may change their format or programming  a new station may adopt a format to compete directly with our stations for audiences and advertisers  or stations might engage in aggressive promotional campaigns 
these tactics could result in lower ratings and advertising revenue or increased promotion and other expenses and  consequently  lower earnings and cash flow for us 
audience preferences as to format or programming may also shift due to demographic or other reasons 
any failure by us to respond  or to respond as quickly as our competitors  could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase our current audience ratings and advertising revenue 
we have substantial indebtedness that could limit our ability to grow and compete 
our financial leverage and  as a result  our debt service obligations  may have an impact on our financial results and operations  including limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt payments or other corporate purposes  compete with competitors that are better capitalized than us  and react to changing market conditions  changes in our industry and economic downturns 
as of december   we had indebtedness of approximately million  consisting of million of convertible subordinated notes and million under our credit facility 
under our credit facility  as of december   we may borrow up to an additional million under the revolving portion of our credit facility  excluding million in outstanding letters of credit 
we may reborrow under our revolving credit facility as needed to fund our working capital needs  for general corporate purposes and to fund the acquisitions of additional radio stations 

table of contents if we lose key personnel  including on air talent  our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer 
our business depends upon the continued efforts  abilities and expertise of our executive officers  primarily our chairman and chief executive officer  farid suleman 
we believe that the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by mr 
suleman would be difficult to replace  and his loss could have a material adverse effect on us  including impairing our ability to execute our business strategy 
mr 
suleman does not have a formal employment agreement 
additionally  our radio stations employ or independently contract with several on air personalities and hosts of syndicated radio programs with significant loyal audiences in their respective broadcast markets 
these on air personalities are sometimes significantly responsible for the ranking of a station  and for the ability of the station to sell advertising 
we cannot assure you that these individuals will remain with our radio stations or will retain their audiences 
we have had a history of net loss 
in june  citadel broadcasting corporation  formed by affiliates of forstmann little co  acquired substantially all of the outstanding common stock of citadel communications corporation in a leveraged buyout transaction 
citadel communications corporation  together with its wholly owned subsidiary  citadel broadcasting company  is referred to as the predecessor company prior to june our predecessor company had a net loss of million for the period from january  through june   and we had a net loss of million for the period from june  through december   a net loss of million for the year ended december  and a net loss of million for the year ended december  the primary reasons for these losses are significant charges for depreciation and amortization relating to our acquisition of citadel communications and the acquisition of radio stations  interest charges on our outstanding debt and corporate non cash deferred stock compensation 
if we cannot renew our fcc licenses  our business will be impaired 
our business depends upon maintaining our broadcasting licenses issued by the fcc  which are issued currently for a maximum term of eight years and are renewable 
interested parties may challenge a renewal application 
on rare occasions  the fcc has revoked licenses  not renewed them  or renewed them only with significant qualifications  including renewals for less than a full term 
we cannot assure you that our pending or future renewal applications will be approved  or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications that could adversely affect our operations 
if we fail to renew  or renew with substantial conditions or modifications including renewing one or more of our licenses for a term of fewer than eight years any of our licenses  it could prevent us from operating the affected station and generating revenue from it 
moreover  governmental regulations and policies may change over time and the changes may have a material adverse impact upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we could experience delays in expanding our business  be prevented from making acquisitions or be required to divest radio stations due to antitrust laws and other legislative and regulatory considerations 
the federal trade commission  the united states department of justice and the fcc carefully review our proposed business acquisitions and dispositions under their respective regulatory authority  focusing on the effects on competition  the number of stations owned in a market and the effects on concentration of market revenue share 
any delay  prohibition or modification required by regulatory authorities could adversely affect the terms of a proposed transaction or could require us to modify or abandon an otherwise attractive opportunity 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing federal regulation 
among other things  the communications act of  as amended  which we refer to as the communications act  and fcc rules and policies limit the number of broadcasting properties that any person or entity may own  directly or by attribution  in any market and require fcc approval for transfers of control and assignments of licenses 
the filing of petitions or complaints against us or any fcc licensee from which we acquire a station could result in the fcc delaying the grant of  or refusing to grant or imposing conditions on its consent to the assignment or transfer of control of licenses 
the communications act and fcc rules and policies also impose limitations on non us 
table of contents ownership and voting of our capital stock 
on june   the fcc concluded an omnibus rulemaking proceeding in which it examined all broadcast ownership rules  including the local radio ownership rule  the broadcast newspaper ownership rule  the radio television cross ownership rule  the local television ownership rule  the national television ownership rule and the dual network rule 
the fcc made significant changes to the local radio ownership rule and the way that it reviews radio station transactions 
as a result of these changes  our existing station portfolio will exceed the applicable ownership limit in several markets 
existing ownership combinations  however  are grandfathered  meaning the fcc will not require us to divest stations that we currently own in order to come into compliance with the new rules 
the new rules will limit our ability to acquire radio stations that we would have been permitted to acquire under the old rules 
pending transactions are also subject to the new rule 
various aspects of these rule changes were appealed by a number of different entities 
the rules were to become effective on september   but were stayed by the us court of appeals for the third circuit on september  on september   the third circuit issued an order granting in part a request filed by the fcc to partially lift the court s stay 
the order permitted the new local radio ownership rules adopted june  to go into effect 
a number of parties also filed requests with the fcc seeking reconsideration of certain aspects of the new rules  including  without limitation  the grandfathering provisions discussed above 
in addition  there is significant congressional opposition to the new rules  and bills have been introduced in congress to modify or repeal the fcc s action  including a requirement that companies divest stations to come into compliance with the revised rules 
there are risks associated with our acquisition strategy 
our current acquisition strategy is to identify and acquire radio stations that would expand our station clusters in existing and contiguous markets  as well as provide us entry into new markets that rank in the top based on total market revenue 
we believe that the most material risks related to this strategy are increases in prices for radio stations due to increased competition for acquisition opportunities  reduction in the number of suitable acquisition targets resulting from continued industry consolidation  and failure or unanticipated delays in completing acquisitions due to difficulties in obtaining required regulatory approval  including potential delays resulting from the uncertainty regarding legal challenges to the fcc s adoption of new broadcast ownership rules 
additional risks  which we have not yet experienced to a material degree  include difficulty in integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations  reduction in the number of suitable acquisition targets resulting from the more restrictive local radio ownership rule adopted by the fcc in june failure of some acquisitions to prove profitable or generate sufficient cash flow  issuance of large amounts of common stock in order to purchase radio stations  need to finance acquisitions through funding from the credit or capital markets  and inability to finance acquisitions on acceptable terms 
in order to remain competitive  we must respond to changes in technology  services and standards which characterize our industry 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies 
we may not have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies 
several new media technologies are being developed  including the following audio programming by cable television systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  personal communications systems  internet content providers and other digital audio broadcast formats  
table of contents satellite digital audio radio service  which is provided by two companies offering national satellite radio services  including numerous niche formats  with sound quality comparable to that of compact discs  in band on channel digital radio  which could improve the quality of existing am and fm stations  including stations owned by us  and low power fm radio  which could result in additional fm radio broadcast outlets designed to serve small  localized areas

our common stock has been publicly traded since august the market price of our common stock has been subject to fluctuations since the date of our initial public offering 
the stock market has from time to time experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of securities 
as a result  the market price of our common stock could materially decline  regardless of our operating performance 
our failure to comply under the sarbanes oxley act of could cause a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 
we have undergone a comprehensive effort to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of compliance was required as of december  this effort included documenting and testing our internal controls 
as of december   we did not identify any material weaknesses in our internal controls as defined by the public 
table of contents company accounting oversight board 
in future years  there are no assurances that we will not have material weaknesses that would be required to be reported or that we will be able to comply with the reporting deadline requirements of section a reported material weakness or the failure to meet the reporting deadline requirements of section could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview citadel is the fifth largest radio broadcasting company in the united states based on net broadcasting revenue 
as of february   we owned and operated fm and am radio stations in markets located in states across the country 
we have a well clustered radio station portfolio that is diversified by programming formats  geographic regions  audience demographics and advertising clients 
we rank first or second in audience share in of our rated markets 
our top markets accounted for approximately of our revenue 
advertising revenue our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of local  regional and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations 
in  approximately of our net broadcast revenue was generated from the sale of local and regional advertising and approximately was generated from the sale of national advertising 
the major categories of our advertisers include automotive companies  retail merchants  restaurants  fast food chains  telephone companies and grocery stores 
each station s local sales staff solicits advertising either directly from the local advertiser or indirectly through an advertising agency 
through direct advertiser relationships  we can better understand the advertiser s business needs and more effectively design advertising campaigns to sell the advertiser s products 
we employ personnel in each of our markets to assist in the production of commercials for the advertiser 
in house production  combined with effectively designed advertising  establishes a stronger relationship between the advertiser and the station cluster 
national sales are made by a firm specializing in radio advertising sales on the national level  in exchange for a commission based on gross revenue 
we also target regional sales  which we define as sales in regions surrounding our markets  to companies that advertise in our markets  through our local sales force 
depending on the programming format of a particular station  we estimate the optimum number of advertising spots that can be broadcast while maintaining listening levels 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by managing advertising inventory 
pricing is adjusted based on local market conditions and our ability to provide advertisers with an effective means of reaching a targeted demographic group 
each of our stations has a general target level of on air inventory 
this target level of inventory may vary throughout the day but tends to remain stable over time 
much of our selling activity is based on demand for our radio stations on air inventory and  in general  we respond to changes in demand by varying prices rather than changing our target inventory level for a particular station 
therefore  most changes in revenue reflect demand driven pricing changes 
a station s listenership is reflected in ratings surveys that estimate the number of listeners tuned to the station and the time they spend listening 
advertisers and advertising representatives use station ratings to consider advertising with the station 
we use station ratings to chart audience levels  set advertising rates and adjust programming 
the radio broadcast industry s principal ratings service is arbitron  which publishes periodic ratings surveys for significant domestic radio markets 
these surveys are our primary source of audience ratings data 
we believe that radio is one of the most efficient and cost effective means for advertisers to reach specific demographic groups 
advertising rates charged by radio stations are based primarily on the following the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  a station s share of audiences in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  as measured by ratings surveys estimating the number of listeners tuned to the station at various times  and the number of stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups 

table of contents components of expenses our most significant expenses are sales costs  programming expenses  advertising and promotional expenses and administrative and technical expenses 
we strive to control these expenses by working closely with local management and centralizing functions such as finance  accounting  legal  human resources and management information systems 
we also use our multiple stations  market presence and purchasing power to negotiate favorable rates with vendors 
depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of radio stations and interest carrying charges historically have been significant factors in determining our overall profitability 
based on intangible assets currently held by us as of december   we expect the total amortization expense incurred will continue to decrease due to the remaining weighted average useful amortization period of intangible assets subject to amortization 
results of operations our results of operations represent the operations of the radio stations owned or operated by us  or for which we provide sales and marketing services  during the applicable periods 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report 
historically  we have managed our portfolio of radio stations through selected acquisitions  dispositions and exchanges  as well as through the use of local marketing agreements  or lmas  and joint sales agreements  or jsas

 goodwill and other intangible assets  and were required to assess our goodwill and fcc licenses for impairment within the first six months of  and on at least an annual basis thereafter 
our intangible assets include fcc licenses  goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of december  and december   we had approximately  million and  million  respectively  in intangible assets  which represent approximately of our total assets 
the fair value of our fcc licenses and goodwill is primarily dependent on the cash flows of our stations 
we utilize independent appraisals to determine the fair value of fcc licenses and goodwill for significant acquisitions 
these appraisals principally use the discounted cash flow methodology to determine the value of the fcc licenses 
this approach consists of a quantitative model  which incorporates variables such as market advertising revenues  market revenue share projections  anticipated operating profit margins and various discount rates 
the variables used in the analysis reflect historical station and advertising market growth trends  as well as anticipated performance and market conditions 
in years subsequent to the appraisals  we evaluate each market to determine if any significant changes have occurred in the market that would adversely impact the value of the fcc licenses  and in some cases  we may engage a third party appraiser to assist in this evaluation 
we review the current year s cash flows of the market and the audience share ratings of the market compared to the year of the appraisals 
multiples of operating cash flow are also considered 
our impairment testing for goodwill is determined based primarily on discounted expected future cash flows to be generated from each market 
these cash flows are then compared to the net book value of all intangible and tangible assets of each market  including goodwill 
if the cash flows exceed the book value of all intangible and tangible assets  then no impairment of goodwill exists 
we have performed our annual impairment analysis of our fcc licenses and goodwill 
these analyses make various assumptions about growth rates and market conditions in determining whether an impairment exists 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the industry or us  or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of our fcc licenses or goodwill below the amounts reflected in the balance sheet  we may be required to recognize impairment charges in future periods  which could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
contingencies and litigation 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our exposures related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 

table of contents we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
income taxes 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in the third quarter of  we reversed a substantial portion of our valuation allowance associated with our deferred tax assets  the most significant of which was our net operating loss carry forward 
we believe the net operating loss will be utilized within the carry forward period 
this determination is based on management s estimates of future taxable income  to the extent that actual results differ materially from management s estimates  an increase in the valuation allowance could be required 
contractual and commercial commitments due to the completion of our secondary offering in february of see liquidity and capital resources stock and convertible notes offerings  the contractual commitments under our senior debt and subordinated debt have been significantly reduced 
in august  we entered into a new senior credit facility that provides for million in revolving loans through january  in connection therewith  we repaid amounts outstanding under the previous senior credit facility 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the revolving portion of our senior debt and million outstanding under our convertible notes 
the table below reflects our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period in millions contractual obligation total less than year to years to years more than years senior debt and convertible subordinated notes interest payments on convertible notes pending acquisitions sports broadcasting and employment contracts operating leases other contractual obligations total contractual cash obligations our pending acquisitions are subject to the satisfaction of various conditions  including the receipt of required regulatory approvals 
see federal regulation of radio broadcasting multiple ownership rules 
this table assumes that these conditions will be satisfied and that all of our pending acquisitions will be completed within one year 
subsequent to december   we closed acquisition transactions totaling million and completed dispositions totaling million 
we expect that we will be able to fund our remaining obligations and commitments with cash flow from operations 
to the extent we are unable to fund these obligations and commitments with cash flow from operations  we intend to fund these obligations and commitments with proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility 
our million in convertible subordinated notes are due february   with interest payable february and august each year 
to the extent that our cash flow from operations is insufficient to repay the convertible subordinated notes  we may be required to seek additional funding from the credit or capital markets in order to repay the remaining balance of these convertible subordinated notes 
variable rate interest payments related to our credit facility have not been included in the contractual obligation table above 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements on july   we entered into a local marketing agreement related to a radio station in knoxville  tennessee 
during the three year term of this agreement  the current station owner has the option  but not the obligation  to require us to purchase all of the assets of the station for million 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 we have determined that this is a variable interest entity and that we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
accordingly  the entity has been consolidated with our operations as of august in connection with the acquisition of a radio station in salt lake city  ut  we agreed to guarantee up to million of the seller s other financing through may of we have no other material off balance sheet arrangements or transactions 
impact of inflation we do not believe inflation has a significant impact on our operations 
however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a number of financial market risks in the ordinary course of business 
we believe our primary financial market risk exposure pertains to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit agreement  which bears interest based on variable rates 
we have not taken any action to cover interest rate market risk  and are not a party to any interest rate market risk management activities 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points applied to the million of variable rate debt that was outstanding as of december  based on this analysis  the impact on future earnings for the following twelve months would be approximately million of increased interest expense 
this potential increase is based on certain simplifying assumptions  including a constant level of variable rate debt
