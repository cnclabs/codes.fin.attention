recent developments evaluation of webmd health transaction alternatives 
webmd is continuing to pursue its previously announced plan to establish webmd health as a separate publicly traded company 
webmd s board of directors continues to evaluate the two previously announced alternatives it has been considering a one step split off of webmd health equity through an exchange offer transaction with webmd s stockholders or an initial public offering of a minority interest in webmd health 
in the case of a one step split off  all holders of webmd common stock would have the right  on a pro rata basis  to exchange shares of webmd common stock for newly issued shares of webmd health common stock at an exchange ratio that would be set by the board of directors of webmd 
while the evaluation process is complex  considerable progress has been made in refining the tax analysis of these alternative transactions  preparing the necessary financial statements and securities and exchange commission filings  planning the necessary corporate infrastructure separation and completing the analysis of employee  corporate  third party contractual and other considerations relevant to these two alternatives 
as each alternative offers certain potential advantages for webmd s stockholders  some of which are dependant on market conditions  the board will not make a decision as to which alternative to pursue until shortly before webmd is in a position to make the required registration statement filing with the sec

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of webmd s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the 
table of contents consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current business factors  and various other assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic  environmental and political factors  and changes in our business environment  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant 
such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  short term and long term investments  deferred tax assets  income taxes  collectibility of customer receivables  prepaid content and distribution services  long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  software development costs  inventory valuation  certain accrued expenses  contingencies  litigation and the value attributed to warrants issued for services 
we believe the following reflects our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue our revenue recognition policies for each reportable segment are as follows webmd business services 
healthcare payers and providers pay us fees for transaction services  generally on either a per transaction basis or  in the case of some providers  on a monthly fixed fee basis 
healthcare payers and providers also pay us fees for patient statement and paid claims communication services  typically on a per statement or per communication basis 
additionally  payers  including government payers  pay us fees to license decision support software and provide related support and maintenance for that decision support software  and provide information technology consulting services 
healthcare payers pay us annual license fees  which are based on the number of covered members  for use of our software and for providing business and information technology consulting services to them on a time and materials basis 
the consulting services we provide to certain governmental agencies are typically billed on a cost plus fee structure 
revenue for transaction services  patient statement and paid claims communication services is recognized as the services are provided 
decision support software and the related support and maintenance agreements are generally sold as bundled time based license agreements and accordingly  the revenue for both the software and related support and maintenance is recognized ratably over the term of the license and maintenance agreement 
revenue for consulting services is recognized as the services are provided 
webmd practice services 
healthcare providers pay us fees to license our medical manager and intergy practice management systems and intergy ehr electronic medical records system 
our practice management systems are sold as multiple element arrangements as these software arrangements typically include related hardware  support and maintenance agreements and implementation and training services 
we also charge healthcare providers fees for transmitting  through webmd network services  transactions to payers and billing statements to patients 
we recognize revenue from these fees  which are generally paid on a per transaction or monthly basis  as we provide the service 
software revenue is recognized in accordance with sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
software license revenue is recognized when a customer enters into a non cancelable license agreement  the software product has been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  there are no significant future 
table of contents performance obligations  the license fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the license fee is considered probable 
amounts received in advance of meeting these criteria are deferred 
as required by sop  the company determines the value of the software component of its multiple element arrangements using the residual method as vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for the undelivered elements such as the support and maintenance agreements and related implementation and training services  but not for all the delivered elements such as the software itself 
the residual method requires revenue to be allocated to the undelivered elements based on the fair value of such elements  as indicated by vsoe 
vsoe is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
the vast majority of our practice management and medical records systems include support and maintenance agreements of the underlying software and hardware 
these arrangements provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades released during the term of the support period  as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel 
revenue from support and maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  typically one year or less 
additionally  many of our software arrangements include implementation and training services 
revenues from these services are accounted for separately from the software revenue  as they are not essential to the functionality of any other element of the software arrangement  and are generally recognized as the services are performed 
webmd health 
customers pay us for advertising  sponsorship  healthcare management tools  content syndication and distribution  and licenses of private online portals 
in addition  in connection with our medscape portal  our customers provide funding for online education programs for healthcare professionals  including online continuing medical education cme

revenue from cme arrangements is recognized over the period we satisfy the minimum credit hour requirements of the applicable agreements 
revenue from fixed fee content license or carriage fees is recognized ratably over the term of the applicable agreement 
e commerce revenue is recognized when a subscriber or consumer utilizes our internet based services or purchases goods or services through our web site or a web site co branded with one of our strategic partners 
subscription revenue  including subscription revenue from sponsorship arrangements  is recognized over the subscription period 
when contractual arrangements contain multiple elements  revenue is allocated to the elements based on their relative fair values  determined using prices charged when elements are sold separately 
porex 
we develop  manufacture and distribute porous plastic products and components 
for standard products  we recognize revenue upon shipment of product  net of sales returns and allowances 
for sales of certain custom products  we recognize revenue upon completion and customer acceptance 
recognition of amounts received in advance of meeting these criteria is deferred until we meet these criteria 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets arise from the acquisitions we have made 
the amount assigned to intangible assets is subjective and based on our estimates of the future benefit of the intangible asset using accepted valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flow and replacement cost models 
our long lived assets  excluding goodwill  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which we determined based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of long lived assets  excluding goodwill  whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill annually 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of goodwill 
there was no impairment of goodwill noted as a result of our impairment testing in  or 
table of contents investments our investments  at december   consisted principally of certificates of deposit  municipal bonds  auction rate securities  asset backed securities  federal agency notes  us treasury notes and marketable equity securities in publicly traded companies 
each reporting period we evaluate the carrying value of our investments and record a loss on investments when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
our investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value 
we do not recognize gains on an investment until sold 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
future changes in market or economic conditions or operating results of our investments could result in gains or losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s carrying value 
deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately billion 
these loss carryforwards may be used to offset taxable income in future periods  reducing the amount of taxes we might otherwise be required to pay 
due to a lack of a history of generating taxable income  we record a valuation allowance equal to of our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that we are able to generate taxable earnings in the future and determine it is more likely than not that we can realize our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made which may increase income in the period that such determination was made 
tax contingencies our tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by tax authorities 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
our estimates of tax contingencies reflect assumptions and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
we believe that these assumptions and judgments are reasonable  however  our accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have accrued

as part of either of the two alternatives  webmd health will become a separate public company 
in the case of a one step split off transaction  webmd health s financial results will no longer be consolidated with those of webmd 
neither of the two alternatives will result in any significant increase in webmd s long term debt or other principal commitments and  in either case  webmd believes that it will continue  for the foreseeable future  to have sufficient cash resources to meet the commitments described above in this section that remain with webmd and our current anticipated working capital and capital expenditure

recent accounting pronouncements in december  we adopted emerging issues task force eitf issue  the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share eitf 
eitf requires that an entity include the effect of contingently convertible instruments in diluted earnings per share regardless of whether any contingent features of those instruments have been met 
in addition  eitf requires retroactive restatement of previously reported diluted shares 
while our convertible subordinated notes include a contingent conversion feature  the adoption of eitf did not have an impact on diluted earnings per share  as these instruments were anti dilutive for all periods presented 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 revised share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 

sfas no 
requires abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to idle facility  freight handling and wasted material expenses to be recognized as current period charges 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we believe the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued eitf no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  eitf no 
which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity investments 
the new impairment model applies to investments accounted for under the cost or equity method and investments accounted for under sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
eitf no 
also includes new disclosure requirements for cost method investments and for all investments that are in an unrealized loss position 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf no 
 however the disclosure requirements remain effective and those applicable have been adopted 
we will evaluate the effect  if any  of eitf when final guidance is issued 

table of contents key trends affecting our businesses and our healthcare customers several key trends in the healthcare marketplace are influencing the use of healthcare information services and technology solutions of the types we provide or are developing 
those trends  and the strategies we have developed in response  are described briefly below high rates of increase in healthcare costs 
according to the centers for medicare medicaid services  or cms  healthcare spending in the united states rose to trillion in  up from trillion in  trillion in and trillion in the cms report indicated a growth rate in healthcare spending of for  compared to for  and for the rate of increase in was three percentage points higher than the increase gross domestic product for the united states 
the rate of increase in private spending for physician services  which accounts for two thirds of payments for physician services  accelerated percentage points to 
cms indicated that healthcare s share of gross domestic product was for the difficulties involved in controlling healthcare costs have resulted in the following key trends cost shifting by employers to their employees and changes in plan design 
employers are seeking to shift a greater portion of healthcare costs onto their employees and to redefine traditional health benefits 
people in employer sponsored health plans are paying much more out of their own pockets than they did a few years ago and are likely to see their share continue to increase significantly in the near future 
with the shift in financial burdens  consumers are assuming a more active role in managing their health and need information to make educated benefit  provider and treatment decisions 
we are continuing the process of transforming webmd health  our consumer portal  from an online place that consumers go for information to a place where they can actively manage their health 
in addition  through our webmd health services business  we help employers and plans provide employees and plan members with answers to healthcare and plan benefit questions  decision support tools and personalized information and feedback 
webmd health intends to continue to make significant investments in its infrastructure  as well as in new products and services  to position ourselves to provide additional interactive online services 
increased use of information technology for clinical purposes 
governmental and commercial payers continue to exert considerable pricing pressure on providers 
as a result  in order to maintain their incomes  providers need to see more patients and increase productivity and or reduce their operating costs 
use of information technology can assist providers in these efforts 
healthcare providers are also under pressure to increase quality and reduce medical errors 
while information technology systems and electronic transaction services are used by many physician offices for administrative and financial applications  their use in clinical workflow is much more limited  especially in smaller practices 
we believe that is changing and we are continuing to target the market for clinical applications as one of our priorities for the next several years 
while it will be a long time before most physicians go to a paperless office  more physicians are beginning to incorporate information technology into their clinical workflow  and our products allow them to make this shift in a gradual way 
in  webmd practice services released a new suite of clinical software called intergy ehr 
we believe that  in light of the increasing importance of clinical software to healthcare providers  webmd practice services success in retaining existing practice management system customers and attracting new customers may depend  in substantial part  on their response to intergy ehr 
improving quality of care through use of information technology quality initiatives 
health plans recognize that encouraging the good health of their members not only benefits the members but also has financial benefits for the health plans 
healthier people need less care and fewer costly services 
thus  controlling costs by keeping people healthier and better managing chronic conditions has become a significant focus for america s healthcare system 
managed care emerged in the s as a new approach to healthcare 
table of contents delivery  combining a greater emphasis on preventive care with careful monitoring of resource utilization and provider performance 
however  while managed care produced some important cost reductions  it also met with consumer resistance to what was perceived as its excessive restrictions 
then  in and  a series of major studies suggested that the nation s healthcare system should be fundamentally redirected to focus on continuous quality improvement and anticipating healthcare needs  rather than controlling access to services 
to achieve this  the healthcare industry required both new thinking and new techniques 
today  health plans seek to understand the needs of their members  including those whose medical conditions are likely to generate the greatest cost of services  and are working to offer both providers and members timely information to improve their health through appropriate care 
health plans and employer sponsors also seek to anticipate member and employee needs and to reach out to them with personalized communications 
finally  health plans and employers want to be able to determine the effectiveness of these efforts 
vips  which we acquired in  provides software and services that helps health plans identify and serve members who need the most care and to anticipate the future needs of member populations 
in addition  webmd health provides online private portals that assist employers and health plans in educating and encouraging employees and plan members to lower health risks and to take a more active role in their healthcare 
pay for performance initiatives 
both governmental and commercial payers have begun to reassess current healthcare provider compensation arrangements  which generally reimburse physicians and other healthcare providers based on the number and complexity of the services provided to patients 
pay for performance initiatives reward healthcare providers for better outcomes and adherence to evidence based guidelines 
these initiatives typically create incentives for improvements in the quality of care and for an increased focus on preventive medicine and appropriate management of chronic illnesses 
the goal is both better outcomes and reductions in hospitalizations and expensive procedures 
information technology plays an important role in pay for performance initiatives  including with respect to the delivery of quality care by providers and quality measurement by payers 
some pay for performance programs provide incentives for use of electronic medical record systems  such as intergy ehr  by providers 
vips provides software and services that can be used to support pay for performance initiatives by payers 
in addition  webmd health is working with bridges to excellence bte  a consortium of employers  providers and plans focused on improving outcomes and the quality of care through incentive programs 
webmd health created and maintains the patient component of bte s diabetes care link program  which provides tools to help patients make treatment and provider decisions in connection with managing their disease  and it is integrated into an outcomes based physician incentive program 
increasing automation of the healthcare reimbursement cycle 
submission of claims electronically assists payers in reducing the cost of processing and servicing claims and can expedite the reimbursement process for providers 
however  this is just a starting point for increasing administrative efficiency 
we are continuing our efforts to transform webmd business services whose name was changed in from webmd envoy from an electronic transactions clearinghouse to a provider of more complete reimbursement cycle management services for healthcare providers and transaction related administrative services for healthcare payers 
the new name is intended to reflect this transformation  which in turn is intended to allow us to provide the benefits of economies of scale to our customers in various stages of the healthcare reimbursement cycle 
in order to be more efficient  many healthcare payers are focusing upon core activities building cost effective provider networks  marketing their services to employers  and adjudicating claims payment and are outsourcing pre and post adjudication administrative activities  such as printing and mailing checks and explanation of benefits and other document management activities  including conversion of paper claims to electronic form 
by outsourcing these services to us  payers can reduce operating costs and capital expenditures 
our acquisitions of advanced business fulfillment and medifax edi in and dakota imaging in april support our ability to 
table of contents provide more comprehensive business process outsourcing services 
through vips  which we acquired in august  we provide healthcare payers with information technology solutions and related services for claims processing  provider performance measurement  quality improvement  fraud detection  disease management and predictive modeling 
we are working to cross sell our additional services to healthcare payers 
we expect that  over time  our revenue and earnings from providing basic electronic clearinghouse services for routing healthcare transactions  on their own  will decline 
however  we believe that the revenue and earnings of our business process outsourcing and other transaction related services  in conjunction with our clearinghouse services  is likely to  over time  offset any such decline 
nonetheless  we believe that it is possible that  during certain reporting periods  revenue from basic clearinghouse services could decline faster than we are able to increase the revenue from our additional services  in part because of the length of the implementation cycle for the additional services 
we intend to continue the transformation of webmd business services by developing or acquiring additional transaction related services and updating our existing ones 
our strategy is to continue to increase the value we are able to provide our payer and provider customers in all aspects of their adoption and implementation of information technology solutions for healthcare transactions 
increased use of the internet by physicians and as a source of health information for consumers 
a study published in by the pew internet and american life project estimated that approximately half of all american adults in the united states have accessed the internet for health information  with nearly three quarters of those who use the internet reporting use of the internet for health information 
webmd health is a leading destination on the internet for these consumers 
see healthcare information services and technology solutions webmd health below 
the internet allows us to offer consumers the resources they are looking for  with immediate access to searchable information and dynamic interactive content 
physicians are also increasingly turning to the internet for professional activities 
in  approximately  physicians and healthcare professional participants earned approximately  continuing medical education credits at medscape  an increase of approximately and over respectively 
as a result  webmd health enables its sponsors  including pharmaceutical  medical device and consumer products companies  to reach targeted consumers when they are looking for answers to healthcare questions and to reach physicians when they are exploring new treatment options 
however  pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers currently spend only a very small portion of their marketing and educational budgets on online media 
our strategy is to seek a greater portion of these budgets and to increase sponsorship of our portals by consumer products companies whose products have health claims 
governmental initiatives relating to healthcare information technology 
there are currently numerous federal  state and private initiatives seeking ways to increase the use of information technology in healthcare  including in the physician s office 
most significantly  in april  executive order directed the appointment of a national coordinator for health information technology to coordinate programs and policies regarding health information technology across the federal government 
the national coordinator is charged with directing the health information technology programs within the department of health and human services  or hhs  and coordinating them with those of other relevant executive branch agencies 
in may  david j 
brailer md  md  was appointed to serve in this new position 
also in accordance with that executive order  hhs issued a report during entitled the decade of health information technology delivering consumer centric and information rich health care 
at webmd  an important part of our mission has been fostering adoption of information technology and electronic communications in healthcare 
accordingly  we welcome governmental and private initiatives designed to achieve the same goals 
however  these initiatives may encourage more companies 
table of contents to enter our markets or result in the development of technology solutions that compete with ours 
the national coordinator has indicated that he intends to encourage widespread adoption of health information technology throughout the healthcare system and  to do that  intends to facilitate the development and transfer of knowledge and technology used by the federal government to the private sector 
in november  the national coordinator published a request for information seeking public comment regarding considerations in implementing a national health information network nhin 
we are committed to promoting the development and adoption of interoperable health care information services and technology solutions and were one of many healthcare information technology companies that responded to the request for information 
we believe that our experience in processing large volumes of electronic healthcare transactions  together with our experience in providing electronic health records and practice management software to medical practices and clinics and providing it services to private and governmental healthcare payers  makes us a good candidate to work with hhs on nhin related initiatives and projects 
the effect that governmental initiatives relating to healthcare information technology may have on our businesses is difficult to predict and there can be no assurances that we will adequately address the risks created by these initiatives or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting opportunities 
we intend to continue to invest in new products and services and in improving our existing products and services  both through internal development activities and  in certain cases  through acquisitions 
we make these investments based on our assessments of the needs of our customers and potential customers  including the trends described above 
however  the market for healthcare in the united states is highly complicated and there can be no assurance that the trends identified above will continue or that the expected benefits to webmd from our responses to those trends will be achieved 
in addition  the markets for healthcare information services and technology solutions are highly competitive and not only are our existing competitors seeking to benefit from these same trends  but the trends may also attract additional competitors 
factors that may affect our future financial condition or results of operations this section describes circumstances or events that could have a negative effect on our financial results or operations or that could change  for the worse  existing trends in some or all of our businesses 
the occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events described below could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows or on the trading prices of the common stock and convertible notes that we have issued 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing webmd 
additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations 
risks related to our relationships with customers of webmd business services and webmd practice services the financial results of webmd business services could be adversely affected if payers conduct electronic data interchange  or edi  transactions without using a clearinghouse or if their ability to do so allows them to terminate or modify their relationships with us there can be no assurance that healthcare payers will continue to use webmd business services and other independent companies to transmit healthcare transactions 
some payers currently offer electronic data transmission services to healthcare providers that bypass third party edi service providers such as webmd business services 
in addition  some payers currently offer electronic data transmission services through affiliated clearinghouses that compete with webmd business services 
see some of our customers compete with us and some  instead of using a third party provider  perform internally some of the services that we offer below 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain our 
table of contents existing relationships with payers or develop new relationships on satisfactory terms  if at all 
although we believe the use of clearinghouses will continue to be the most efficient way for most providers to transact electronically with multiple payers  the hipaa transaction standards may facilitate use of edi links for transmission of transactions between a greater number of healthcare payers and providers without use of a clearinghouse 
any significant increase in the utilization of links between healthcare providers and payers without use of a third party clearinghouse could have a material adverse effect on webmd business services transaction volume and financial results 
in addition  any increase in the ability of payers to bypass third party edi service providers may adversely affect the terms and conditions we are able to negotiate in our agreements with them  which could also have a material adverse impact on webmd business services business and financial results 
some of our customers compete with us and some  instead of using a third party provider  perform internally some of the services that we offer some of our existing payer and provider customers and some of our strategic partners compete with us or may plan to do so or belong to alliances that compete with us or plan to do so  either with respect to the same products and services we provide to them or with respect to some of our other lines of business 
see business competition for our healthcare information services and technology solutions above 
for example  some payers currently offer  through affiliated clearinghouses  web portals and other means  electronic data transmission services to healthcare providers that allow the provider to bypass third party edi service providers such as webmd business services  and additional payers may do so in the future 
the ability of payers to do so may adversely affect the terms and conditions we are able to negotiate in our connectivity agreements with them and our transaction volume 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing relationships for connectivity services with payers or develop new relationships on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in addition  some of our services allow healthcare payers to outsource business processes that they have been or could be performing internally and  in order for us to be able to compete  use of our services must be more efficient for them than use of internal resources 
webmd business services transaction volume and financial results could be adversely affected if we do not maintain relationships with practice management system vendors and large submitters of healthcare edi transactions we have developed relationships with practice management system vendors and large submitters of healthcare claims to increase the usage of our webmd business services transaction services 
webmd practice services is a competitor of these practice management system vendors 
some of these vendors have  as a result of our ownership of webmd practice services or for other reasons  chosen to diminish or terminate their relationships with webmd business services  and others may do so in the future 
some other large submitters of claims compete with  or may have significant relationships with entities that compete with  webmd business services or webmd health 
we could also lose transaction volume from practice management system vendors and other large submitters of claims if the payments we offer them as an inducement to use our transaction services are not competitive with other alternatives available to them 
to the extent that we are not able to maintain mutually satisfactory relationships with the larger practice management system vendors and large submitters of healthcare edi transactions  webmd business services transaction volume and financial results could be adversely affected 

table of contents contractual relationships with governmental customers may impose special burdens on us and provide special benefits to those customers  including the right to change or terminate the contract in response to budgetary constraints or policy changes a portion of webmd business services revenues comes from customers that are governmental agencies 
the recent acquisition of vips has increased that portion and we intend to seek additional government contracts and subcontracts 
government contracts and subcontracts may be subject to some or all of the following termination when appropriated funding for the current fiscal year is exhausted  termination for the governmental customer s convenience  subject to a negotiated settlement for costs incurred and profit on work completed  along with the right to place contracts out for bid before the full contract term  as well as the right to make unilateral changes in contract requirements  subject to negotiated price adjustments  most favored pricing disclosure requirements that are designed to ensure that the government can negotiate and receive pricing akin to that offered commercially and requirements to submit proprietary cost or pricing data to ensure that government contract pricing is fair and reasonable  commercial customer price tracking requirements that require contractors to monitor pricing offered to a specified class of customers and to extend price reductions offered to that class of customers to the government  reporting and compliance requirements related to  among other things equal employment opportunity  affirmative action for veterans and for workers with disabilities  and accessibility for the disabled  broader audit rights than we would usually grant to non governmental customers  and specialized remedies for breach and default  including setoff rights  retroactive price adjustments  and civil or criminal fraud penalties  as well as mandatory administrative dispute resolution procedures instead of state contract law remedies 
in addition  certain violations of federal law may subject government contractors to having their contracts terminated and  under certain circumstances  suspension and or debarment from future government contracts 
finally  some of our governmental contracts are priced based on our cost of providing products and services 
those contracts are subject to regulatory cost allowability standards and a specialized system of cost accounting standards 
long sales  installation and implementation cycles for some webmd business services applications and some webmd practice services applications may result in unanticipated fluctuations in their revenues webmd practice services 
webmd practice services is seeking to increase its sales to larger physician groups and clinics 
these sales are typically not only larger in size  but also involve more complex practice management and electronic medical records applications 
as a result  we expect longer sales  contracting and implementation cycles for these customers 
these sales may be subject to delays due to customers internal procedures for approving large expenditures and for deploying new technologies  implementation may be subject to delays based on the availability of the internal customer resources needed 
we are unable to control many of the factors that will influence the timing of the buying decisions of potential customers or the pace at which installation and training may occur 
unexpected delays in these sales or in their implementation may result in unanticipated fluctuations in the revenues of webmd practice services 
vips 
vips provides licensed software products and related services to payers and information technology services to government customers 
the period from our initial contact with a potential vips client and the purchase of our solution by the client is difficult to predict 
in the past  it has generally ranged from six to months  but in some cases has extended much longer 
sales by vips may be subject 
table of contents to delays due to customers internal procedures for approving large expenditures  to delays in government funding and other factors outside of our control 
the time it takes to implement a licensed software solution is also difficult to predict and has lasted as long as months from contract execution to the commencement of live operation 
implementation may be subject to delays based on the availability of the internal resources of the client that are needed and other factors outside of our control 
as a result  we have only limited ability to forecast the timing of revenue from new vips sales 
during the sales cycle and the implementation period  we may expend substantial time  effort and money preparing contract proposals and negotiating the contract without receiving any related revenue 
webmd practice services faces competition in providing support services to owners of the medical manager and other systems webmd practices services faces competition for the support services it markets to owners of the medical manager systems  as well as for similar services that we market to owners of certain other practice management systems that we have acquired 
physician practices may seek such support from third parties  including businesses that support or manage information technology for various types of clients and businesses that specialize in systems for physicians  some of whom may formerly have been independent dealers of the medical manager software or of practice management systems we have acquired 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these service providers 
in addition  some physician practices  especially larger ones  may use their own employees and other internal resources to support their practice management systems 
some of our clients have terminated their support services contracts in the past and we expect such terminations to occur in the future 
risks related to the development and performance of our webmd business services and webmd practice services solutions our ability to generate revenue could suffer if we do not continue to update and improve our existing products and services and develop new ones we must introduce new healthcare information services and technology solutions and improve the functionality of our existing products and services in a timely manner in order to retain existing customers and attract new ones 
however  we may not be successful in responding to technological and regulatory developments and changing customer needs 
the pace of change in the markets we serve is rapid  and there are frequent new product and service introductions by our competitors and by vendors whose products and services we use in providing our own products and services 
if we do not respond successfully to technological and regulatory changes and evolving industry standards  our products and services may become obsolete 
technological changes may also result in the offering of competitive products and services at lower prices than we are charging for our products and services  which could result in our losing sales unless we lower the prices we charge 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the products we develop or license will be able to compete with the alternatives available to our customers 
for more information about the competition we face  see business healthcare information services and technology solutions competition for our healthcare information services and technology solutions above 
developing and implementing new or updated products and services may take longer and cost more than expected we rely on a combination of internal development  strategic relationships  licensing and acquisitions to develop our products and services 
the cost of developing new healthcare information services and technology solutions is inherently difficult to estimate 
our development and implementation of proposed products and services may take longer than originally expected  require more testing than originally anticipated and require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources 
if we are unable to develop new or updated products and services on a timely basis and implement them without significant 
table of contents disruptions to the existing systems and processes of our customers  we may lose potential sales and harm our relationships with current or potential customers 
new or updated products and services will not become profitable unless they achieve sufficient levels of market acceptance there can be no assurance that healthcare providers and payers will accept from us new or updated products and services or products and services that result from integrating existing and or acquired products and services  including our updated electronic medical records products  the business process outsourcing services for payers we have developed internally and through acquisition  and our updated clinical transaction services 
the future results of webmd practice services and webmd business services will depend  in significant part  on the success of these products and services and on our ability to keep our other information technology and connectivity products up to date 
providers and payers may choose to use similar products and services offered by our competitors if they are already using products and services of those competitors and have made extensive investments in hardware  software and training relating to the competitors existing products and services 
even providers and payers who are already our customers may not purchase new or updated products or services  especially when they are initially offered and if they require changes in equipment or workflow 
in addition  there can be no assurance that payers who use our services for sending and receiving claims will use our other pre and post adjudication services 
for services we are developing or may develop in the future  there can be no assurance that we will attract sufficient customers or that such services will generate sufficient revenues to cover the costs of developing  marketing and providing those services 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any pricing strategy that we implement for any new products and services will be economically viable or acceptable to the target markets 
failure to achieve broad penetration in target markets with respect to new or updated products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects 
achieving market acceptance of new or updated products and services is likely to require significant efforts and expenditures achieving market acceptance for new or updated products and services is likely to require substantial marketing efforts and expenditure of significant funds to create awareness and demand by participants in the healthcare industry 
in addition  deployment of new or updated products and services may require the use of additional resources for training our existing sales force and customer service personnel and for hiring and training additional salespersons and customer service personnel 
there can be no assurance that the revenue opportunities from new or updated products and services will justify amounts spent for their development  marketing and roll out 
we could be subject to breach of warranty  product liability or other claims if our software products  information technology systems or transmission systems contain errors or experience failures undetected errors in the software and systems we provide to customers or the software and systems we use to provide services could cause serious problems for our customers 
for example  errors in our transaction processing systems can result in healthcare payers paying the wrong amount or making payments to the wrong payee 
if problems like these occur  our customers may seek compensation from us or may seek to terminate their agreements with us  withhold payments due to us  seek refunds from us of part or all of the fees charged under those agreements or initiate litigation or other dispute resolution procedures 
we also provide products and services that assist in healthcare decision making  including some that relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans 
if these products malfunction or fail to provide accurate and timely information  we could be subject to product liability claims 
in addition  we 
table of contents could face breach of warranty or other claims or additional development costs if our software and systems do not meet contractual performance standards  do not perform in accordance with their documentation  or do not meet the expectations that our customers have for them 
our software and systems are inherently complex and  despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in prior versions  current versions or future versions or enhancements 
see also during times when we are making significant changes to our products and services  there are increased risks of performance problems below 
we attempt to limit  by contract  our liability for damages arising from negligence  errors or mistakes 
however  contractual limitations on liability may not be enforceable in certain circumstances or may otherwise not provide sufficient protection to us from liability for damages 
we maintain liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors and omissions 
however  it is possible that claims could exceed the amount of our applicable insurance coverage or that this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts 
even if these claims do not result in liability to us  investigating and defending against them could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from our operations 
in addition  negative publicity caused by these events may delay market acceptance of our products and services  including unrelated products and services 
performance problems with webmd business services systems or system failures could cause us to lose customers or cause customers to reduce the number of transactions we process for them we process payer and provider transactions and data at our own facilities and at a data center in tampa  florida that is operated by an independent third party 
we have contingency plans for emergencies with our systems  however  we have limited backup facilities to process information if these facilities are not functioning 
the occurrence of a major catastrophic event or other system failure at any of our facilities or at the third party facility could interrupt data processing or result in the loss of stored data  which could have a material adverse impact on our business 
our payer and provider customer satisfaction and our business could be harmed if webmd business services experiences transmission delays or failures or loss of data in its transaction processing systems 
similarly  performance problems with the systems we use to provide our other transaction related administrative services  including our print and mail services and scanning and imaging services  or any system failures affecting those services  could harm our business and adversely affect our customer relationships 
webmd business services systems are complex and  despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that problems will not occur or that they will be detected and corrected promptly if they do occur 
see also during times when we are making significant changes to our products and services  there are increased risks of performance problems below 
during times when we are making significant changes to our products and services  there are increased risks of performance problems if we do not respond successfully to technological and regulatory changes and evolving industry standards  our products and services may become obsolete 
see our ability to generate revenue could suffer if we do not continue to update and improve our existing products and services and develop new ones above 
the software and systems that we sell and that we use to provide services are inherently complex and  despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in any enhancements  updates and new versions that we market or use 
even if new products and services do not have performance problems  our technical and customer service personnel may have difficulties in installing them or in their efforts to provide any necessary training and support to customers 
for example  we have had and may continue to have transmission or processing problems relating to implementation of the hipaa transaction standards and our all payer suite of services 
these problems included transmission failures resulting from sending large batches of electronic transactions to non commercial payers who have been accustomed to receiving transactions through a greater number of smaller batches  enrollment and other set up errors resulting from initiating services to large numbers of 
table of contents customers simultaneously  and various other transmission  processing  interfacing and service problems resulting from the implementation of new software and new business processes 
we expect to make significant additional changes in to the hardware and software webmd business services uses to provide connectivity services 
while the new hardware and software will be tested before it is used in production  we cannot be sure that the testing will uncover all problems that may occur in actual use 
any significant problems that occur could have material adverse effect on our relationships with customers of both webmd business services and webmd practice services 
if our systems or the internet experience security breaches or are otherwise perceived to be insecure  our business could suffer a significant security breach could damage our reputation or result in liability 
we retain and transmit confidential information  including patient health information  in our processing centers and other facilities 
it is critical that these facilities and infrastructure remain secure and be perceived by the marketplace as secure 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches and hackers or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
despite the implementation of security measures  this infrastructure or other systems that we interface with  including the internet and related systems  may be vulnerable to physical break ins  hackers  improper employee or contractor access  computer viruses  programming errors  attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems 
any compromise of our security  whether as a result of our own systems or systems that they interface with  could reduce demand for our services

performance problems with webmd business services systems could affect our relationships with customers of our practice services business webmd business services provides the transaction services  including the all payer transaction services  used by the webmd network services customers of our practice services business 
as an increasing number of our webmd practice services customers rely on us to provide our all payer suite of transaction services  disruptions to those services could cause some of those customers to obtain some or all of their software support requirements from competitors of ours or could cause some customers to switch to a competing physician practice management or billing software solution 
webmd business services ability to provide transaction services depends on services provided by telecommunications companies webmd business services relies on a limited number of suppliers to provide some of the telecommunications services necessary for its transaction services 
the telecommunications industry has been subject to significant changes as a result of changes in technology  regulation and the underlying economy 
recently  many telecommunications companies have experienced financial problems and some have sought bankruptcy protection 
some of these companies have discontinued telecommunications services for which they had contractual obligations to webmd business services 
webmd business services inability to source telecommunications services at reasonable prices due to a loss of competitive suppliers could affect its ability to maintain its margins until it is able to raise its prices to its customers and  if it is not able to raise its prices  could have a material adverse effect on its financial results 
risks related to the operations of webmd health s public web sites our advertising and sponsorship revenues may vary significantly from quarter to quarter our advertising and sponsorship revenues may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  not all of which are in our control  and may be difficult to forecast accurately 
the majority of our sponsorship contracts are for terms of approximately four to months in length  with 
table of contents relatively few longer term contracts 
we cannot assure you that our current sponsors will continue existing programs beyond the term of the existing contract or that they will enter into any additional contracts for new programs 
in addition  the time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or sponsor regarding a specific program and the execution of a contract with the advertiser or sponsor for that program may be lengthy  especially for larger contracts  and may be subject to delays over which we have little or no control  including as a result of budgetary constraints of the advertiser or sponsor or their need for internal approvals 
other factors that could affect the timing of our revenues from advertisers and sponsors include timing of fda approval for new products or for new approved uses for existing products  seasonal factors relating to the prevalence of specific health conditions and other seasonal factors that may affect the timing of promotional campaigns for specific products  and scheduling of conferences for physicians and other healthcare professionals 
many of the expenses related to our web sites are relatively fixed in the short term  including personnel costs and technology and infrastructure costs 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall or delay  in which case our results of operations would suffer 
in addition  in an attempt to enhance our long term competitive position  we may from time to time make decisions regarding pricing  marketing  services and technology that could have a near term adverse effect on our operating results 
our ability to maintain or increase our advertising and sponsorship revenues depends on our ability to retain or increase usage of our online offerings by consumers and physicians we generate revenues by  among other things  selling sponsorships of specific pages  sections or events on our online web sites for healthcare providers and consumers and related e mailed newsletters 
our advertisers and sponsors include pharmaceutical  biotech  medical device and consumer products companies that are interested in communicating with and educating our audience or parts of our audience 
while we currently attract a large audience of health involved consumers and clinically active healthcare professionals to our online offerings  we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to do so 
users of our web sites have numerous other online and offline sources of healthcare information services 
it is difficult to predict the rate at which users will sample our offerings and the extent to which they will become members and or return users 
in addition  some of our traffic and new members come to us through relationships with third parties and  as a result  our traffic may vary based on the amount of traffic to web sites of these third parties and other factors outside our control 
a decline in user traffic levels or a reduction in the number of pages viewed by users may cause our revenues to decrease and could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
our ability to retain or increase usage of our web sites depends on our ability to create or license high quality health content  interactive tools and other features in order to attract and retain users to our web sites  we need to continue to provide high quality  informative content and tools 
we must also properly anticipate and respond to user interests and preferences regarding content 
our writers and editors create some of the content we use 
we also purchase or license content from other companies 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to get needed content at reasonable cost 
if we fail to provide high quality content of the types our users are seeking  our business will suffer as a result of decreased interest in our web sites and a reduction in advertising and sponsorship revenues 
the addition of new interactive tools and other features will require that we continue to improve the technology underlying our web site 
the required changes may be significant and expensive  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute them quickly and efficiently 

table of contents changes in government regulation or industry guidelines could adversely affect our online continuing medical education offerings our medscape physician portal is a leading provider of online continuing medical education  or cme  to physicians and other healthcare professionals  offering a wide selection of free  regularly updated online cme activities 
we receive funding from pharmaceutical and medical device companies for these cme programs 
see business webmd health continuing medical education cme above 
our cme activities are planned and implemented in accordance with the essential areas and policies of the accreditation council for continuing medical education  or accme  which oversees providers of cme credit  and other applicable accreditation standards 
in september  accme revised its standards for commercial support of cme 
the revised standards are intended to ensure  among other things  that cme activities of accme accredited providers are independent of providers of healthcare goods and services that fund the development of cme 
accme expects accredited providers to implement these standards by may implementation has required additional disclosures to cme participants about those in a position to influence content and other adjustments to the management and operations of our cme programs 
medscape believes it has modified its procedures as appropriate to meet the revised standards 
however  we cannot be certain whether these adjustments will ensure that we meet the new standards or predict whether accme may impose additional requirements 
provision of cme may also be subject to government regulation by the food and drug administration  or fda  and the office of inspector general  or oig  of the united states department of health and human services  a federal agency responsible for interpreting certain federal laws relating to healthcare 
see business government regulation regulation of healthcare relationships and regulation of drug and medical device advertising and promotion above 
increased regulatory scrutiny of cme sponsorship by pharmaceutical or medical device companies  changes to existing regulations or accreditation standards  or changes in internal compliance procedures of potential sponsors may require medscape to make changes in the way it offers or provides cme programs  may slow sponsors internal approval processes for cme  and may reduce the volume of sponsored cme programs implemented by medscape to levels that are lower than expected 
loss of a small number of sponsors could have a material adverse effect on our advertising and sponsorship revenues a substantial portion of our advertising and sponsorship revenues come from a relatively small number of companies 
thus  the loss of a small number of these relationships or a reduction in the purchases by a portion of these sponsors could have a material adverse effect on our advertising and sponsorship revenues 
we may lose such relationships or experience a reduction in purchases if customers decide not to renew their commitments or renew at lower levels  which may occur if we fail to meet our customers expectations or needs or fail to keep up with our competition or for reasons outside our control  including changes in economic and regulatory conditions affecting the healthcare industry or changes specific to the businesses of particular customers 
for more information  see risks related to providing products and services to the healthcare industry developments in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business and business government regulation above 
we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to increase advertising and sponsorship revenue from consumer products companies most of our advertising and sponsorship revenues have  in the past  come from pharmaceutical and medical device companies 
during the past year  we have begun to focus on increasing sponsorship from consumer products companies that are interested in communicating health related or safety related information about their products to our audience 
however  while a number of consumer products companies have indicated an intent to increase the portion of their promotional spending used on the internet  there can be no assurance that these advertisers and sponsors will find our consumer web site to be as effective for promoting their products and services as other on line offerings available to them or as 
table of contents traditional advertising media 
if we encounter difficulties in competing with the other alternatives available to consumer products companies  this portion of our business may develop more slowly than we expect or may fail to develop 
performance problems with the systems of our content providers could disrupt our web sites we depend on content providers to provide information and data feeds on a timely basis 
we could experience disruptions or interruptions in service due to the failure or delay in the transmission or receipt of this information 
risks related to our private online portals webmd health services provides private online portals to employers and payers for use by their employees and members 
these private online portals are subject to many of the same risks as webmd health s public web sites  particularly the risks relating to sourcing and providing healthcare related content 
in addition  the following risks are specific to our private online portals business lengthy sales and implementation cycles for our private online portals make it difficult to forecast our revenues from these applications webmd health services provides private online portals to employers and payers for use by their employees and members 
the period from our initial contact with a potential webmd health services client and the first purchase of our solution by the client is difficult to predict 
in the past  it has generally ranged from six to months  but in some cases has extended much longer 
sales by webmd health services may be subject to delays due to customers internal procedures for approving large expenditures and other factors outside of our control 
the time it takes to implement a customized private online portal is also difficult to predict and has lasted as long as six months from contract execution to the commencement of live operation 
implementation may be subject to delays based on the availability of the internal resources of the client that are needed and other factors outside of our control 
as a result  we have only limited ability to forecast the timing of revenue from new customers 
this  in turn  makes it more difficult to predict quarterly financial performance 
during the sales cycle and the implementation period  we may expend substantial time  effort and money preparing contract proposals  negotiating the contract and implementing the private online portal without receiving any related revenue 
in addition  many of the expenses related to webmd health services are relatively fixed in the short term  including personnel costs and technology and infrastructure costs 
if webmd health services has lower revenue than expected  we may not be able to reduce spending in the short term in response 
any shortfall in revenue would have a direct impact on our results of operations 
we must continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure  both hardware and software  to effectively meet demand for our private online portals we must continue to add hardware and enhance software to accommodate increased usage of our private online portals 
in order to make timely decisions about hardware and software enhancements  we must be able to accurately forecast the growth in demand for our services 
this growth in demand for our private online portals is difficult to forecast 
if we are unable to increase the data storage and processing capacity of our systems at least as fast as the growth in demand  our systems may become unstable and our customers may encounter delays or disruptions in their service 
unscheduled downtime could harm our business and also could discourage current and potential customers and reduce future revenues

risks applicable to our use of the internet most of webmd health s services are provided through the internet 
in addition  webmd business services and webmd practice services provide some internet based services and use the internet to receive some data from customers 
the following risks apply to our use of the internet in our businesses our internet based services are dependent on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure our ability to deliver our internet based services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties 
this includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  as well as timely development of complementary products such as high speed modems  for providing reliable internet access and services 
the internet has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and the amount of traffic 
if the internet continues to experience increased usage  the internet 
table of contents infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it 
in addition  the performance of the internet may be harmed by increased usage 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure  and it could face outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage as well as the availability of the internet to us for delivery of our internet based services 
in addition  our customers who utilize our web based services depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other web site operators for access to our web site 
all of these providers have experienced significant outages in the past and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties in the future due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
any significant interruptions in our services or increases in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users of and advertisers and sponsors on our web site and  if sustained or repeated  could reduce the attractiveness of our services 
delivery of web based services requires uninterrupted communications and computer service from third party service providers and our own systems our web based services  including webmd health s public web sites and private online portals  are designed to operate hours a day  seven days a week  without interruption 
to do so  we rely on internal systems as well as communications and hosting services provided by third parties 
we do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services 
to operate without interruption  both we and our service providers must guard against damage from fire  power loss and other natural disasters  communications failures  software and hardware errors  failures or crashes  security breaches  computer viruses and similar disruptive problems  and other potential interruptions 
we have experienced periodic system interruptions in the past  and we cannot guarantee that they will not occur again 
in addition  some of our web based services may  at times  be required to accommodate higher than expected volumes of traffic 
at those times  we may experience slower response times or system failures 
any sustained or repeated interruptions or disruptions in these systems or increase in their response times could damage our relationships with clients  customers  advertisers and sponsors 
although we maintain insurance for our business  we cannot guarantee that our insurance will be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur or to provide for costs associated with business interruptions 
implementation of changes in hardware and software platforms used to deliver our web based services may result in performance problems from time to time  we implement changes to the hardware and software platforms we use for providing web based services  including those that webmd health uses to create and deliver our public web sites and private online portals 
during and after the implementation of those changes  a platform may not perform as expected  which could result in interruptions in operations  an increase in response time or an inability to track performance metrics 
any significant interruption in our ability to operate our web based services  including webmd health s public web sites and private online portals  could have an adverse effect on our relationship with users  clients and sponsors and  as a result  on our financial results 
government regulation of the internet could adversely affect our business the internet and its associated technologies are subject to government regulation 
our failure  or the failure of our business partners  to accurately anticipate the application of laws and regulations affecting our products and services and the manner in which we deliver them  or any other failure to comply  could create liability for us  result in adverse publicity  or negatively affect our business 
in addition  new laws 
table of contents and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  may be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services covering user privacy  patient confidentiality  consumer protection and other issues  including pricing  content  copyrights and patents  distribution  and characteristics and quality of products and services 
we cannot predict whether these laws or regulations will change or how such changes will affect our business

other risks applicable to webmd health webmd health s primary businesses are difficult to evaluate because they have a limited operating history webmd health s primary businesses have a limited operating history and participate in relatively new and rapidly evolving markets 
as a result  each of these businesses has undergone significant changes during its short history and is continuing to change 
we cannot assure you that the business strategies webmd health currently relies on will be successful in the long term 
many companies with business plans based on providing healthcare information through the internet have failed to be profitable and some have filed for bankruptcy and or ceased operations 
there can be no assurance that webmd health s services  even if demand from users exists  will continue to be profitable for us to provide 
third parties may bring claims against us as a result of content we provide  which may be expensive and time consuming to defend consumers access health related information on our public web sites and through our private online portals  including information regarding particular medical conditions and possible adverse reactions or side effects from medications 
if our content contains inaccuracies  it is possible that consumers or other third parties may seek to sue us for various causes of action 
we have editorial procedures in place to provide quality control of the information that we publish or provide 
however  there can be no assurance that our editorial and other quality control procedures will be sufficient to ensure that there are no errors or omissions in particular content 
even if potential claims do not result in liability to us  investigating and defending against these claims could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from our operations 
in addition  our business is based on establishing webmd as trustworthy and dependable sources of healthcare information 
allegations of impropriety  even if unfounded  could therefore harm our reputation and business 
we could also be subject to third party claims based on the nature and content of information supplied to us by third parties 
we seek to protect webmd from liability for acts or omissions by our content providers by including customary indemnification provisions in our contracts 
however  we cannot provide assurance that any such indemnification will be sufficient to protect against third party claims 
we face potential liability related to the privacy and security of personal information we collect on our web sites internet user privacy has become a controversial issue both in the united states and abroad 
we have privacy policies posted on our public web sites and our private online portals that we believe comply with applicable laws requiring notice to users about our information collection  use and disclosure practices 
however  whether and how existing privacy and consumer protection laws in various jurisdictions apply to the internet is still uncertain and may take years to resolve 
any legislation or regulation in the area of privacy of personal information could affect the way we operate our public web sites and our licensed online services and could harm our business 
further  we can give no assurance that the privacy policies and other statements on our web sites  or our practices  will be found sufficient to protect us from liability or adverse publicity in this area 

table of contents third parties may challenge the enforceability of our online agreements the law governing the validity and enforceability of online agreements and other electronic transactions is evolving 
we could be subject to claims by third parties that our online agreements with consumers and physicians that provide the terms and conditions for use of our public web sites are unenforceable 
a finding by a court that these agreements are invalid could harm our business and require costly changes to our business 
risks related to providing products and services to the healthcare industry developments in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business almost all of the revenues of webmd health  webmd business services and webmd practice services come from customers in various parts of the healthcare industry 
in addition  a significant portion of porex s revenues come from products used in healthcare or related applications 
developments that result in a reduction of expenditures by customers or potential customers in the healthcare industry could have a material adverse effect on our business 
general reductions in expenditures by healthcare industry participants could result from  among other things government regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which healthcare providers interact with patients  payers or other healthcare industry participants  including changes in pricing or means of delivery of healthcare products and services for additional discussion of the potential effects of regulatory matters on our business and on participants in the healthcare industry  see the other risks related to providing products and services to the healthcare industry described below in this section and business government regulation above  consolidation of healthcare industry participants  reductions in governmental funding for healthcare  and adverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting healthcare payers or providers  pharmaceutical companies  medical device manufacturers or other healthcare industry participants 
even if general expenditures by industry participants remain the same or increase  developments in the healthcare industry may result in reduced spending on information technology and services or in some or all of the specific segments of that market we serve or are planning to serve 
for example  use of our products and services could be affected by changes in the billing patterns of healthcare providers  changes in the design of health insurance plans  changes in the contracting methods payers use in their relationships with providers  and decreases in marketing expenditures by pharmaceutical companies or medical device manufacturers  including as a result of governmental regulation or private initiatives that discourage or prohibit promotional activities by pharmaceutical or medical device companies 
in addition  expectations of our customers regarding pending or potential industry developments may also affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to products and services of the types we provide 
see also governmental and private initiatives to support adoption of healthcare information technology may encourage additional companies to enter our markets or result in the development of technology solutions that compete with ours below 
the healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur 
however  the timing and impact of developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict 
we cannot provide assurance that the markets for our products and 
table of contents services will continue to exist at current levels or that we will have adequate technical  financial and marketing resources to react to changes in those markets 
governmental and private initiatives to support adoption of healthcare information technology may encourage additional companies to enter our markets or result in the development of technology solutions that compete with ours there are currently numerous federal  state and private initiatives and studies seeking ways to increase the use of information technology in healthcare  including in the physician s office  as a means of improving care and reducing costs 
for example  the department of health and human services issued a report during entitled the decade of health information technology delivering consumer centric and information rich health care 
at webmd  an important part of our mission has been fostering adoption of information technology and electronic communications in healthcare 
accordingly  we welcome governmental and private initiatives designed to achieve the same goals 
however  these initiatives may encourage more companies to enter our markets or result in the development of technology solutions that compete with ours 
the effect that these initiatives may have on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurances that we will adequately address the risks created by these initiatives or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting opportunities 
government regulation of healthcare creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies the healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political  legislative  regulatory and other influences 
existing and new laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry could create unexpected liabilities for us  cause us to incur additional costs and could restrict our operations 
many healthcare laws are complex and their application to specific products and services may not be clear 
in particular  many existing healthcare laws and regulations  when enacted  did not anticipate the healthcare information services and technology solutions that we provide 
however  these laws and regulations may nonetheless be applied to our products and services 
our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations  or other failure to comply  could create liability for us  result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our businesses 
some of the key risks we face from healthcare regulation are as follows because we are in the business of applying information technology to healthcare  various aspects of hipaa have had and are expected to continue to have significant consequences for webmd business services and webmd practice services and  to a lesser extent  webmd health  because our webmd health business involves advertising and promotion of prescription and over the counter drugs and medical devices  any increase in regulation of these areas by the federal drug administration or the federal trade commission could make it more difficult for us to contract for sponsorships and advertising  because we sell items and services to healthcare providers and physicians  our sales and promotional practices must comply with federal and state anti kickback laws  our healthcare connectivity and transaction related administrative services must be provided in compliance with federal and state false claims laws  and in providing health information to consumers  we must comply with corporate practice of medicine rules and not offer professional medical advice  diagnosis or treatment

table of contents risks related to porex s business and industry porex s success depends upon demand for its products  which in some cases ultimately depends upon end user demand for the products of its customers demand for our porex products may change materially as a result of economic or market conditions and other trends that affect the industries in which porex participates 
in addition  because a significant portion of our porex products are components that are eventually integrated into or used with products manufactured by customers for resale to end users  the demand for these product components is dependent on product development cycles and marketing efforts of these other manufacturers  as well as variations in their inventory levels  which are factors that we are unable to control 
accordingly  the amount of porex s sales to manufacturer customers can be difficult to predict and subject to wide quarter to quarter variances 
porex s success may depend on satisfying rapidly changing customer requirements a significant portion of our porex products are integrated into end products used in various industries  some of which are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and practices and frequent new product introductions 
accordingly  porex s success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to develop and introduce in a timely manner products that meet changing customer requirements and to differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors 
if we do not introduce new porex products in a timely manner and make enhancements to existing products to meet the changing needs of our porex customers  some of our products could become obsolete over time  in which case our customer relationships  revenue and operating results would be negatively impacted 
potential new or enhanced porex products may not achieve sufficient sales to be profitable or justify the cost of their development we cannot be certain  when we engage in porex research and development activities  whether potential new products or product enhancements will be accepted by the customers for which they are intended 
achieving market acceptance for new or enhanced products may require substantial marketing efforts and expenditure of significant funds to create awareness and demand by potential customers 
in addition  sales and marketing efforts with respect to these products may require the use of additional resources for training our existing porex sales forces and customer service personnel and for hiring and training additional salespersons and customer service personnel 
there can be no assurance that the revenue opportunities from new or enhanced products will justify amounts spent for their development and marketing 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any pricing strategy that we implement for any new or enhanced porex products will be economically viable or acceptable to the target markets 
porex may not be able to source the raw materials it needs or may have to pay more for those raw materials some of porex s products require high grade plastic resins with specific properties as raw materials 
while porex has not experienced any material difficulty in obtaining adequate supplies of high grade plastic resins that meet its requirements  it relies on a limited number of sources for some of these plastic resins 
if porex experiences a reduction or interruption in supply from these sources  it may not be able to access alternative sources of supply within a reasonable period of time or at commercially reasonable rates  which could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial results 
disruptions in porex s manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial results any significant disruption in porex s manufacturing operations  including as a result of fire  power interruptions  equipment malfunctions  labor disputes  material shortages  earthquakes  floods  computer 
table of contents viruses  sabotage  terrorist acts or other force majeure  could have a material adverse effect on porex s ability to deliver products to customers and  accordingly  its financial results 
porex may not be able to keep third parties from using technology it has developed porex uses proprietary technology for manufacturing its porous plastics products and its success is dependent  to a significant extent  on its ability to protect the proprietary and confidential aspects of its technology 
although porex owns certain patents  it relies primarily on non patented proprietary manufacturing processes 
to protect its proprietary processes  porex relies on a combination of trade secret laws  license agreements  nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures  including designing and manufacturing its porous molding equipment and most of its molds in house 
trade secret laws do not afford the statutory exclusivity possible for patented processes 
there can be no assurance that the legal protections afforded to porex or the steps taken by porex will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology 
in addition  these protections do not prevent independent third party development of competitive products or services 
the nature of porex s products exposes it to product liability claims that may not be adequately covered by indemnity agreements or insurance the products sold by porex  whether sold directly to end users or sold to other manufacturers for inclusion in the products that they sell  expose it to potential risk of product liability claims  particularly with respect to porex s life sciences  clinical  surgical and medical products 
some of porex s products are designed to be permanently implanted in the human body 
design defects and manufacturing defects with respect to such products sold by porex or failures that occur with the products of porex s manufacturer customers that contain components made by porex could result in product liability claims and or a recall of one or more of porex s products 
porex believes that it carries adequate insurance coverage against product liability claims and other risks 
we cannot assure you  however  that claims in excess of porex s insurance coverage will not arise 
in addition  porex s insurance policies must be renewed annually 
although porex has been able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost in the past  we cannot assure you that porex will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost 
in most instances  porex enters into indemnity agreements with its manufacturing customers 
these indemnity agreements generally provide that these customers would indemnify porex from liabilities that may arise from the sale of their products that incorporate porex components to  or the use of such products by  end users 
while porex generally seeks contractual indemnification from its customers  any such indemnification is limited  as a practical matter  to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party 
if porex does not have adequate contractual indemnification available  product liability claims  to the extent not covered by insurance  could have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
since march  porex has been named as one of many co defendants in a number of actions brought by recipients of mammary implants distributed by porex in the united states 
for a description of these actions  see the information under legal proceedings porex mammary implant litigation above 
economic  political and other risks associated with porex s international sales and geographically diverse operations could adversely affect porex s operations and financial results since porex sells its products worldwide  its business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
in addition  porex has manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom  germany and 
table of contents malaysia 
accordingly  porex s operations and financial results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  differing protection of intellectual property  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
environmental regulation could adversely affect porex s business porex is subject to foreign and domestic environmental laws and regulations and is subject to scheduled and random checks by environmental authorities 
porex s business involves the handling  storage and disposal of materials that are classified as hazardous 
although porex s safety procedures for handling  storage and disposal of these materials are designed to comply with the standards prescribed by applicable laws and regulations  porex may be held liable for any environmental damages that result from porex s operations 
porex may be required to pay fines  remediation costs and damages  which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
risks applicable to our entire company the ongoing investigations by the united states attorney for the district of south carolina and the sec could negatively impact our company and divert management attention from our business operations the united states attorney for the district of south carolina is conducting an investigation of our company 
based on the information available to webmd as of the date of this annual report  we believe that the investigation relates principally to issues of financial accounting improprieties for medical manager corporation  a predecessor of webmd by its merger into webmd in september  and our medical manager health systems subsidiary  however  we cannot be sure of the investigation s exact scope or how long it may continue 
in addition  webmd understands that the sec is conducting a formal investigation into this matter 
adverse developments in connection with the investigations  if any  including as a result of matters that the authorities or webmd may discover  could have a negative impact on our company and on how it is perceived by investors and potential investors and customers and potential customers 
in addition  the management effort and attention required to respond to the investigations and any such developments could have a negative impact on our business operations 
for additional information  see legal proceedings above 
webmd intends to continue to fully cooperate with the authorities in this matter 
while we are not able to estimate  at this time  the amount of the expenses that we will incur in connection with the investigations  we expect that they may continue to be significant 
we face significant competition for our products and services the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive  continually evolving and  in some cases  subject to rapid technological change 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than we do 
these organizations may be better known than we are and have more customers than we do 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these organizations or any alliances they have formed or may form

table of contents technology solutions competition for our healthcare information services and technology solutions and business porex competition above 
third parties may bring claims as a result of the activities of our strategic partners or resellers of our products and services we could be subject to claims by third parties  and to liability  as a result of the activities  products or services of our strategic partners or resellers of our products and services 
even if these claims do not result in liability to us  investigating and defending these claims could be expensive  time consuming and result in adverse publicity that could harm our business 
the performance of our businesses depends on attracting and retaining qualified executives and employees our performance depends on attracting and retaining key personnel  including executives  product managers  software developers and other technical personnel and sales and marketing personnel 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our business and the results of our operations 
we may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights our intellectual property is important to all of our businesses 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  patent and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures and non disclosure contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
we believe that our non patented proprietary technologies and business and manufacturing processes are protected under trade secret  contractual and other intellectual property rights 
however  those rights do not afford the statutory exclusivity provided by patented processes 
in addition  the steps that we take to protect our intellectual property  proprietary information and trade secrets may prove to be inadequate and  whether or not adequate  may be expensive 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect potential or actual misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property  proprietary information or trade secrets 
even if we detect misappropriation or infringement by a third party  there can be no assurance that we will be able to enforce our rights at a reasonable cost  or at all 
in addition  our rights to intellectual property  proprietary information and trade secrets may not prevent independent third party development and commercialization of competing products or services 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services we could be subject to claims that we are misappropriating or infringing intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive to defend and divert management s attention from our operations 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing these rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop non infringing technology  obtain a license or cease selling the products or services that use or contain the infringing intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop non infringing products or services or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we may also be required to indemnify our customers if they become subject to third party claims relating to intellectual property that we license or otherwise provide to them  which could be costly 
we have incurred and may continue to incur losses we began operations in january and  until  had incurred net losses in each year since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion 
we currently intend to continue to invest in infrastructure development  applications development  marketing and acquisitions 
whether we continue to incur losses in a particular period will depend on  among other things  the amount of such investments and whether those investments lead to increased revenues 

table of contents we may be subject to litigation our business and operations may subject us to claims  litigation and other proceedings brought by private parties and governmental authorities 
for information regarding certain proceedings to which we are currently a party  see legal proceedings above 
acquisitions  business combinations and other transactions may be difficult to complete and  if completed  may have negative consequences for our business and our securityholders our company has been built  in part  through a series of acquisitions 
we intend to continue to seek to acquire or to engage in business combinations with companies engaged in complementary businesses 
in addition  we may enter into joint ventures  strategic alliances or similar arrangements with third parties 
these transactions may result in changes in the nature and scope of our operations and changes in our financial condition 
our success in completing these types of transactions will depend on  among other things  our ability to locate suitable candidates and negotiate mutually acceptable terms with them  as well as the availability of financing 
significant competition for these opportunities exists  which may increase the cost of and decrease the opportunities for these types of transactions 
financing for these transactions may come from several sources  including cash and cash equivalents on hand and marketable securities  proceeds from the incurrence of indebtedness  and proceeds from the issuance of additional common stock  preferred stock  convertible debt or other securities 
our issuance of additional securities could cause substantial dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders at the time of the issuance  cause substantial dilution of our earnings per share  and adversely affect the prevailing market price for our outstanding securities 
we do not intend to seek securityholder approval for any such acquisition or security issuance unless required by applicable law or regulation or the terms of existing securities 
our business will suffer if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies or to assess the risks in particular transactions we have in the past acquired  and may in the future acquire  businesses  technologies  services  product lines and other assets 
the successful integration of the acquired businesses and assets into our operations  on a cost effective basis  can be critical to our future performance 
the amount and timing of the expected benefits of any acquisition  including potential synergies between webmd and the acquired business  are subject to significant risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those relating to our ability to maintain relationships with the customers of the acquired business  our ability to cross sell products and services to customers with which we have established relationships and those with which the acquired businesses have established relationships  our ability to retain or replace key personnel  potential conflicts in payer  provider  strategic partner  sponsor or advertising relationships  our ability to coordinate organizations that are geographically diverse and may have different business cultures  and compliance with regulatory requirements 

table of contents we cannot guarantee that any acquired businesses will be successfully integrated with our operations in a timely or cost effective manner  or at all 
failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or to achieve anticipated operating synergies  revenue enhancements or cost savings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although our management attempts to evaluate the risks inherent in each transaction and to value acquisition candidates appropriately  we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain all such risks or that acquired businesses and assets will perform as we expect or enhance the value of our company as a whole 
in addition  acquired companies or businesses may have larger than expected liabilities that are not covered by the indemnification  if any  that we are able to obtain from the sellers 
we may not be able to raise additional funds when needed for our business or to exploit opportunities our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the success of the integration of our businesses  our existing and new applications and service offerings  competing technologies and market developments  potential future acquisitions and additional repurchases of our common stock 
we may need to raise additional funds to support expansion  develop new or enhanced applications and services  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
if required  we may raise such additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders 
we expect that accounting for employee stock options using the fair value method will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share in december  fasb issued sfas r  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june  webmd expects that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more information regarding accounting for stock based compensation plans 
we cannot predict what effect the reduction in our net income may have on the market prices of webmd s securities 
the separation of webmd health from webmd corporation currently being considered by our board of directors will expose you to additional risks and those risks may outweigh the potential benefits as previously announced  we are continuing to pursue a plan to establish webmd health as a separate publicly traded company 
see business recent developments evaluation of webmd health transaction alternatives above 
our board of directors continues to evaluate the two previously announced alternatives it has been considering a one step split off of webmd health equity through an exchange offer transaction with webmd corporation s stockholders  or an initial public offering of a minority interest in webmd health 
if a split off transaction is completed  webmd health will be a new public company  initially owned by those stockholders of webmd corporation who choose to exchange shares of webmd corporation common stock in the split off transaction 
it will no longer be a part of webmd corporation 
holders of webmd corporation common stock after a split off will continue to be subject to the risks applicable to our other segments and those risks will  inherently  be more significant to webmd corporation because webmd corporation will no longer have access to webmd health s cash flows  assets or operations 
we are not able to predict what the market prices of the two companies would be after either alternative transaction and we cannot provide assurance that either of the alternative transactions will produce any increase  for our stockholders  in the market value of their holdings 
in addition  the market 
table of contents prices of webmd corporation common stock and webmd health common stock could be highly volatile for several months after either alternative transaction and may each continue to be more volatile than webmd corporation common stock would have been if a transaction had not occurred 
finally  if a decision is made not to pursue the separation of webmd health from webmd corporation or if a split off or initial public offering cannot be successfully completed  the market price of webmd corporation shares may also be adversely impacted 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain adequate liquidity  while at the same time maximizing the yield we receive from our investment portfolio 
this objective is accomplished by adherence to our investment policy  which establishes the list of eligible types of securities and credit requirements for each investment 
changes in prevailing interest rates will cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities in commercial paper  non government debt securities  money market funds and highly liquid united states treasury notes 
we view these high grade securities within our portfolio as having similar market risk characteristics 
principal amounts expected to mature are million  million and million during  and  respectively 
these include investments totaling million in federal agency notes that are callable subjecting us to interest rate risk on the reinvestment of these securities 
we believe that the impact of any call and resulting reinvestment of proceeds would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our convertible subordinated notes have fixed interest rates  changes in interest rates will not impact our financial condition or results of operations 
we have not utilized derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
exchange rate sensitivity currently  substantially all of our sales and expenses are denominated in united states dollars  however  porex is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the rate of exchange of the united states dollar against the euro 
this exposure arises primarily as a result of translating the results of porex s foreign operations to the united states dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the accounting period 
porex has not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date 
foreign currency translation gains were million  million and million  in  and  respectively 
we believe that future exchange rate sensitivity related to porex will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations
