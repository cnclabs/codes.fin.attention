item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview petroquest energy  inc is an independent oil and gas company with operations in the onshore and offshore regions of the gulf coast basin  as well as in portions of oklahoma and east texas 
our business strategy is to build shareholder value by increasing proved reserves  production  cash flow from operations and net income at low finding and development costs 
during  we successfully executed this strategy as we increased these metrics   and  respectively  from the record increases were the result of our ability to capitalize on another year of strong commodity prices which enabled us to substantially increase our capital expenditures 
during  we invested million  a increase from  into our exploration  development and acquisition activities 
these investments yielded a success rate on wells drilled and the consummation of several strategic acquisitions 
during  we began to diversify a portion of our property base into geographic areas with longer life reserves and production 
we acquired a significant leasehold position in a producing portion of the southeast carthage field in east texas during december and we expanded our operations to oklahoma through two acquisitions during to compliment these transactions  we added personnel with expertise and knowledge specific to these regions dedicated to evaluating and exploiting these properties 
during  we drilled wells in texas and oklahoma  all of which were productive 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were located outside of the gulf coast basin 
while diversification is an important factor in balancing risks  we expect to continue to focus the majority of our resources on the gulf coast basin  as we believe this area represents one of the most attractive exploration and development 
table of contents regions in north america 
with our large acreage position and extensive d seismic database in the gulf coast basin  we believe our management and technical team s expertise and experience developed over the last years will continue to provide us with attractive reinvestment opportunities 
critical accounting policies full cost method of accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain related employee costs  incurred for the purpose of exploring for and developing oil and natural gas are capitalized 
acquisition costs include costs incurred to purchase  lease or otherwise acquire property 
exploration costs include the costs of drilling exploratory wells  including those in progress and geological and geophysical service costs in exploration activities 
development costs include the costs of drilling development wells and costs of completions  platforms  facilities and pipelines 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
sales of oil and gas properties  whether or not being amortized currently  are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas 
the costs associated with unevaluated properties are not initially included in the amortization base and primarily relate to ongoing exploration activities  unevaluated leasehold acreage and delay rentals  seismic data and capitalized interest 
these costs are either transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we compute the provision for depletion of oil and gas properties using the unit of production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities 
unevaluated costs and related carrying costs are excluded from the amortization base until the properties associated with these costs are evaluated 
in addition to costs associated with evaluated properties  the amortization base includes estimated future development costs and dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values 
our depletion expense is affected by the estimates of future development costs  unevaluated costs and proved reserves  and changes in these estimates could have an impact on our future earnings 
we capitalize certain internal costs that are directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the capitalized internal costs include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other related expenses and do not include costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
we also capitalize a portion of the interest costs incurred on our debt 
capitalized interest is calculated using the amount of our unevaluated property and our effective borrowing rate 
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated dd a and related deferred taxes  are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  as adjusted for related income tax effects the full cost ceiling 
if capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  the excess is charged to write down of oil and gas properties in the quarter in which the excess occurs 
declines in prices or reserves could result in a future write down of oil and gas properties 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is probable that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves will change in the near term 
if oil or gas prices decline  even for only a short period of time  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
future abandonment costs future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  gathering systems  wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment 
the accounting for future abandonment costs changed on january   with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement 
table of contents obligations 
see new accounting standards in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this accounting standard 
reserve estimates our estimates of oil and gas reserves are  by necessity  projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effect of regulations by governmental agencies  and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to the extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of expected oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of such oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variance may be material 
derivative instruments under sfas no 
 as amended  the nature of a derivative instrument must be evaluated to determine if it qualifies for hedge accounting treatment 
instruments qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as an asset or liability measured at fair value and subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in equity through other comprehensive income  net of related taxes  to the extent the hedge is effective 
the cash settlements of cash flow hedges are recorded into revenue 
instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in the balance sheet and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as derivative expense income 
our hedges are specifically referenced to the nymex index prices we receive for our gulf coast basin production 
as a result  there is a high correlation between fluctuations in the price we receive for our gulf coast basin oil and gas and the indexed price of the settlement of our hedges 
at december   our hedging contracts were considered effective cash flow hedges 
estimating the fair values of hedging derivatives requires complex calculations incorporating estimates of future prices  discount rates and price movements 
therefore  we choose to obtain the fair value of our commodity derivatives from the counter parties to those contracts 
since the counter parties are market makers  they are able to provide us with a literal market value  or what they would be willing to settle such contracts for as of the given date 
new accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their estimated fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r requires adoption in the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we expect to adopt the standard july  sfas r permits adoption using one of two methods 
a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date using the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards at the effective date related to awards granted prior to the effective date 
an alternate method  the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 

table of contents we currently account for our stock based compensation plans under the principles prescribed by apb opinion no 
accordingly  no stock option compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under the plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r will have a significant impact on our results of operations  but will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the specific impact of the adoption cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact would approximate the impact of sfas as described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reflected as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required 
we did not recognize any excess tax deductions during  or in connection with the exercise of stock options 
in september  the securities and exchange commission adopted staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 regarding the application of sfas no 
by companies following the full cost accounting method 
sab no 
indicates that estimated future dismantlement and abandonment costs that are recorded on the balance sheet are to be included in the costs subject to the full cost ceiling limitation 
the estimated future cash outflows associated with settling the recorded asset retirement obligations should be excluded from the computation of the present value of estimated future net revenues used in applying the ceiling test 
we expect to begin applying sab no 
in the first quarter of results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information with respect to our oil and gas operations for the years ended december   and year ended december  production oil bbls gas mcf total production mcfe sales total oil sales total gas sales total oil and gas sales average sales prices oil per bbl gas per mcf per mcfe the above sales and average sales prices include reductions to revenue related to the settlement of gas hedges of   and  and oil hedges of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to  for the year ended december  the results were attributable to the following components production oil production in totaled  barrels  a increase from the year ended december  natural gas production in increased to bcf from gas production of bcf 
on a gas equivalent basis  production for totaled bcfe  a increase from the period 
the increase in production as compared to was the result of our current year drilling success  which included only one dry hole out of wells drilled  and our acquisition of primarily 
table of contents gas producing properties in the southeast carthage field in december  which contributed bcfe  or  to our net production 
prices average oil prices per barrel during were versus during average gas prices per mcf were during as compared to during stated on a gas equivalent basis  unit prices received during were higher than the prices received during revenue oil and gas sales during increased to  from  during as a result of higher production volumes and commodity prices 
during  interest and other income decreased to  from  during interest and other income recognized during included the settlement of a lawsuit 
expenses as a result of the increase in the number of wells we participate in  lease operating expenses for increased to  from  during however  on an mcfe basis  lease operating expenses decreased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in production taxes increased to  during from  during the increase is due to higher onshore production as a result of acquisitions in texas and oklahoma  as well as an increase in the louisiana severance tax rate effective july  general and administrative expenses during totaled  as compared to  during  net of amounts capitalized of  and  respectively 
the increases in general and administrative expenses are primarily due to higher accrued bonuses in resulting from the company s improved performance in relative to depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense on oil and gas properties for increased to  as compared to  in on an mcfe basis  however  the dd a rate on oil and gas properties totaled per mcfe during as compared to per mcfe for the decrease in per unit dd a was due primarily to acquisitions made during late and throughout at a lower per unit cost than our historical depletion rate and our drilling success 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated prospects  totaled  during versus  during the increase in interest costs is the result of borrowings made in december to fund the acquisition of properties in the carthage field and borrowings made in october to fund the acquisition of properties in oklahoma 
we capitalized  and  of interest during and  respectively 
derivative expense totaled  and  during and  respectively 
the expense recorded in was the result of a gas derivative instrument and an interest rate swap that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
these instruments expired during december and november  respectively 
income tax expense of  was recognized during as compared to  being recorded during the increase is due to an increase in operating profit during the current year 
we provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the results are attributable to the following components 
table of contents production oil production in decreased from the year ended december  natural gas production in decreased from the year ended december  on an mcfe basis  total production for the year ended december  decreased over the same period in the decrease in total production volumes  as compared to  was due to the consistent decline of our gulf coast production and well performance at our bordeaux and berry lake wells  partially offset by the drilling success during the second half of prices average oil prices per barrel during were as compared to for the same period in average gas prices per mcf were during as compared to for the same period in stated on an mcfe basis  unit prices received during were higher than the prices received during revenue oil and gas sales during decreased to  as compared to revenues of  the decrease in production volumes partially offset by the significant increase in realized commodity prices resulted in the decrease in revenue 
interest and other income during increased to  as compared to  during the increase is primarily the result of the settlement of a lawsuit during and the related accounting entries as a result of the settlement 
expenses lease operating expenses for decreased to  from  during on an mcfe basis  lease operating expenses increased from per mcfe in to in the increase during on an mcfe basis is primarily due to an overall decline in production rates and the repairs and maintenance costs at the ship shoal field  which did not increase production rates 
general and administrative expenses during totaled  as compared to expenses of  during  net of amounts capitalized of  and  respectively 
the decreases in general and administrative expenses are primarily due to a decrease in staffing levels during we recognized  and  of non cash compensation expense during and  respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense on oil and gas properties for decreased to  as compared to  in on an mcfe basis  which reflects the changes in production  the dd a rate on oil and gas properties for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe for the increase in per unit dd a as compared to is due primarily to costs in excess of previous estimates during the previous twelve months and unsuccessful exploration drilling results during and interest expense  net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated prospects  increased  during as compared to the increase is the result of an increase in the average debt levels during  the higher interest rates on our sub debt facility and the previously capitalized costs that were expensed on our prior credit facility 
we capitalized  and  of interest during and  respectively 
derivative expense increased  during as compared to this increase is primarily the result of one of our gas derivatives being recorded on the income statement because of a decline in production in the specific field to which the derivative was designated 
the monthly settlements related to this derivative have been recorded to derivative expense effective during june income tax expense of  was recognized during as compared to  being recorded during the increase is due to an increase in operating profit during the current year 
we provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have financed our exploration and development activities to date principally through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings  private and public offerings of common stock and sales of properties 
source of capital operations net cash flow from operating activities increased from  during to  during this increase resulted from higher production and realized commodity prices during the current year 
our working capital deficit at december  totaled  versus a deficit of  at december  the increased working capital deficit is the result of increased expenditures during and the corresponding timing of accounts payable related to exploration  development and operating costs  as well as the increase in our hedging liability  which is the result of the increase in estimated future commodity prices 
we believe that our working capital balance should be viewed in conjunction with availability of borrowings under our bank credit facilities when measuring liquidity 
at december   our borrowing availability totaled  source of capital debt we entered into a bank credit facility on may  pursuant to the credit agreement  petroquest and our subsidiary petroquest energy  llc the borrower have a million revolving credit facility that permits us to borrow amounts from time to time based on the available borrowing base as determined in the bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility is secured by a mortgage on substantially all of the borrower s oil and gas properties  a pledge of the membership interest of the borrower and petroquest s corporate guarantee of the indebtedness of the borrower 
the borrowing base under the bank credit facility is based upon the valuation as of april and october of each year of the borrower s mortgaged properties  projected oil and gas prices  and any other factors deemed relevant by the lenders 
we  or the lenders  may request additional borrowing base re determinations 
as of december   the borrowing base under the bank credit facility was million and was subject to monthly reductions of million beginning february the lenders will determine future monthly reductions in connection with each borrowing base re determination 
at december   we had million of borrowings and no letters of credit issued pursuant to the bank credit facility 
outstanding balances on the revolving credit facility bear interest at either the bank s prime rate plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to based on borrowing base usage but never less than the federal funds effective rate plus or the eurodollar rate plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to depending on borrowing base usage 
the bank credit facility also allows us to use up to million of the borrowing base for letters of credit for fees equal to the applicable margin rate for eurodollar advances 
we are subject to certain restrictive financial and non financial covenants under the bank credit facility including a minimum current ratio of to  as defined in the credit facility agreement 
the bank credit facility also requires the borrower to establish and maintain commodity hedges covering at least of its proved developed producing reserves on a rolling twelve month basis 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants in the bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility matures on may  on november   we obtained a million subordinated term credit facility from macquarie americas corp 
the sub debt facility carries an interest rate of prime plus  is secured by a second mortgage on substantially all of our oil and gas properties and matures november  the sub debt facility is available for advances at any time until december   subject to the restrictive covenants of the sub debt facility and macquarie approval 
at closing  macquarie received warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in conjunction with the december property acquisition  the sub debt facility was amended  the original warrants were cancelled and  warrants were issued to macquarie 
during january  the sub debt facility  including the note  liens  warrants and all other rights of macquarie thereunder  was assigned to macquarie bank limited  an affiliate of macquarie americas corp 
during february  macquarie exercised the outstanding warrants utilizing a cashless exercise provision resulting in the issuance of  shares 
as of december   we had million borrowed under the sub debt facility  which was primarily used to fund our acquisition of properties in the southeast carthage field 
the sub debt facility contains certain restrictive financial and 
table of contents non financial covenants  including a minimum current ratio of to  a total debt threshold of million and a cumulative minimum production and net operating cash flow threshold  all as defined in the sub debt facility 
the sub debt facility also requires us to establish and maintain commodity hedges covering at least of our proved developed producing reserves through november as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants in the sub debt facility 
natural gas and oil prices have a significant impact on our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under our bank credit facility is subject to periodic re determination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can economically produce 
lower prices and or lower production may decrease revenues  cash flows and the borrowing base under the bank credit facility  thus reducing the amount of financial resources available to meet our capital requirements 
although we do not anticipate debt covenant violations  our ability to comply with our debt agreements is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control  such as natural gas and oil prices 
source of capital issuance of securities we have an effective universal shelf registration statement relating to the potential public offer and sale of any combination of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares  and warrants from time to time or when financing needs arise 
the registration statement does not provide assurance that we will or could sell any such securities 
use of capital exploration and development we have an exploration and development program budget for that will require significant capital 
our capital budget for is approximately million of which approximately will be allocated to the gulf coast basin 
based on our outlook of commodity prices and estimated production  we believe that cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund planned exploration and development activities 
in the future  our exploration and development activities could require additional financings  which may include sales of additional equity or debt securities  additional borrowings from banks or other lenders  sales of properties  or joint venture arrangements with industry partners 
we cannot assure you that such additional financings will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we could be forced to delay or even abandon some of our exploration and development opportunities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands after total bank debt subordinated debt operating leases capital projects consists primarily of leases for office space and leases for equipment rentals 
consists of estimated future obligations to abandon our leased properties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s we experience market risks primarily in two areas interest rates and commodity prices 
because all of our properties are located within the united states  we believe that our business operations are not exposed to significant market risks relating to foreign currency exchange risk 

table of contents our revenues are derived from the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production 
based on projected annual sales volumes for  a decline in the estimated average prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production would have an approximate million impact on our revenues 
in a typical hedge transaction  we will have the right to receive from the counterparts to the hedge  the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we are required to pay the counterparts this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged 
we are required to pay the difference between the floating price and the fixed price when the floating price exceeds the fixed price regardless of whether we have sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge 
significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require us to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production 
hedging will also prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge
