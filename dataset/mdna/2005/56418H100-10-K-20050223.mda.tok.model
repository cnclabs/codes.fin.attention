item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations set forth below differs from the md a contained in our annual report to shareholders in that it contains a revised constant currency and organic constant currency presentation 
specifically  in the md a set forth below we have eliminated the presentation of net earnings per share diluted on a constant currency basis  revised the reconciliation of constant currency and organic constant currency to gaap  placed the reconciliation after the segment results  and revised our disclosure regarding our use of these measures in evaluating our operating results 
the revisions were made in response to comments that we received from the staff of the securities and exchange commission in connection with their review of our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  business overview manpower inc is a world leader in the employment services industry 
our global network of over  offices in countries and territories allows us to meet the needs of our customers in all industry segments  whether they are global  multi national or local companies 
by offering a complete range of services  we can help any company no matter where they are in their business evolution raise productivity through improved strategy  quality  efficiency and cost reduction 
revenues from services in millions united states france emea jefferson wells right other operations operating unit profit in millions united states france emea jefferson wells right other operations we do this through the manpower family of companies see principal operating units which includes manpower temporary and permanent staffing  employee assessment  and training jefferson wells professional financial services right management consultants career transition and organizational consulting services elan it recruitment and managed services for example  to ensure that customers have the right person with the right skills when business demand is high  we offer permanent  temporary and contract recruitment  and employee assessment and training services 
we also provide highly specialized professional services  such as internal audit and controls  technology risk management  tax  finance and accounting services 
if customers are searching for ways to work smarter  we also offer a wide range of organizational consulting services such as strategic talent management and leadership development 
on the other hand  if a customer s business demand is low  we offer career transition outplacement services 
we also offer managed services if a customer wants to outsource a complete business function with us  such as call center  help desk  recruiting  or manufacturing operations 
this balanced business mix allows us to offset the cyclical affects of the national economies in which we operate 
our leadership position also allows us to be a center for quality employment opportunities for people at all different points in their career paths 
each year  we employ more than two million people who work to help our more than  customers meet their business objectives 
laborers  seasoned professionals  mothers returning to work  elderly persons wanting to supplement pensions and disabled individuals all turn to manpower for employment 
similarly  governments of the nations in which we operate look to us to help them reduce unemployment and train the unemployed with the skills they need to enter the workforce 
in this way  manpower is a bridge to permanent employment for those who desire it 
our industry is large and fragmented  comprised of thousands of firms employing millions of people and generating billions of us dollars in annual revenues 
it is also a highly competitive industry  reflecting several trends in the global marketplace  notably increasing demand for skilled people and consolidation among customers and in the employment services industry itself 
we manage these trends by leveraging established strengths  including one of the employment services industry s best recognized brands  geographic diversification  size and service scope  an innovative product mix  and a strong customer base 
while staffing is an important aspect of our business  our strategy is focused on providing both the skilled employees our customers need and high value workforce management solutions 
customer demand for employment services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the countries in which we operate 
improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor  resulting in greater demand for our services 
correspondingly  during periods of weak economic growth or economic contraction  the demand for our staffing services typically declines  while demand for our career transition services accelerates 
during the last several years  secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility have had a favorable impact on demand for our services in several markets 
as companies attempt to increase the variability of their cost base  contemporary work solutions help them to effectively address the fluctuating demand for their products or services 
due to our industry s dependence on economic factors  the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of the economy and the short term nature of staffing assignments  it is difficult to forecast future demand for our services with any certainty 
as a result  we monitor a number of economic indicators  as well as recent business trends  to predict future revenue growth trends 
based upon these anticipated trends  we determine whether additional personnel and office investments are necessary to take full advantage of growth opportunities 
our staffing business is organized and managed primarily on a geographic basis  and jefferson wells and right are operated as separate global business units 
each country and business unit primarily has its own distinct operations  and is managed locally by its own management team 
each operation reports directly  or indirectly through a regional manager to a member of executive management 
given this reporting structure  all of our operations have been segregated into the following segments united states  france  emea europe  middle east and africa  excluding france  jefferson wells  right  and other operations 
the united states  france  emea  and other operations segments derive a significant majority of their revenues from the placement of temporary workers 
the remaining revenues within these segments are derived from other human resource services  including permanent employee recruitment  temporary and permanent employee testing  selection  and training and development 
jefferson wells revenues are derived from internal audit and control services  technology risk management  tax  finance and accounting services 
the right segment revenues are derived from career transition outplacement services and organizational performance consulting 
segment revenues represent sales to external customers 
due to the nature of our business  we do not have export or intersegment sales 
we provide services to a wide variety of customers  none of which individually comprise a significant portion of revenue for us as a whole and by segment  except for jefferson wells  in which approximately of jefferson wells revenues for were generated from providing services to one customer 
constant currency changes in our revenues and operating profits include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions and dispositions 
we provide constant currency and organic constant currency calculations in this annual report to remove the impact of these items 
we typically express year over year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage 
when we use the term constant currency  it means that we have translated financial data for a period into us dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period 
we believe that this calculation is a useful measure  indicating the actual growth of our operations 
we utilize constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance 
we also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors 
earnings from our subsidiaries are not generally repatriated to the united states  and we typically do not incur significant gains or losses on foreign currency transactions with our subsidiaries 
therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact only reported earnings and not our actual cash flow or economic condition 
when we use the term organic constant currency  it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation 
we believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth of our pre existing business 
the results of companies we acquire or dispose of are included in or excluded from our financial results on and after the date on which the acquisition or disposition is complete 
as a result  these types of transactions distort the reported year over year trends in our financial results because the results of acquired companies are not included in our prior year results and the results of companies we dispose of are included in prior year but not current year results 
therefore  we believe it is more meaningful to present trend information without the impact of acquisitions and dispositions 
constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances  along with a reconciliation of these amounts to certain of our reported results  are included on page results of operations years ended december   and consolidated results compared to revenues from services increased to billion 
revenues were favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period due to the weakening of the us dollar relative to the currencies in most of our non us markets 
in constant currency  revenues increased 
revenues were also favorably impacted by acquisitions  primarily the acquisition of right management consultants  inc rmc 
revenues increased excluding acquisitions or on an organic constant currency basis 
this growth rate is a result of improving economic conditions and increased demand for our services in all of our major markets  particularly emea and jefferson wells  where revenues increased and respectively  on a constant currency basis 
gross profit increased to billion in the gross profit margin increased basis points to in from in gross profit growth from acquisitions  primarily from rmc  was approximately million  which favorably impacted the gross profit margin by basis points 
excluding acquisitions  gross profit margin was in  an increase of basis points over the gross profit margin of in this improvement is a result of the change in the mix of services provided  toward those with higher gross profit margins 
approximately one half of this improvement is due to the relatively higher growth at jefferson wells  with the remaining improvement a result of an increase in our permanent placement business  particularly in the emea and the other operations segments 
while we saw gross profit margin improvement in our temporary staffing business in several markets  this improvement was offset by decreases in others due to increased social costs  including increased us workers compensation costs and state unemployment taxes 
selling and administrative expenses increased during or in constant currency 
this increase is primarily in response to the increase in business volume and the impact of acquisitions  including the intangible asset amortization of million in resulting from the rmc acquisition 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  these expenses increased  or on an organic constant currency basis 
as a percent of revenues  selling and administrative expenses were in compared to in this ratio is impacted by the acquisition of rmc  because rmc has a different cost structure than our existing business 
excluding acquisitions  selling and administrative expenses were of revenues in  an improvement of basis points

operating profit increased over  with an operating profit margin of in compared to in on a constant currency basis  operating profit increased 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  operating profit increased  or on an organic constant currency basis in operating profit margin  excluding acquisitions  improved to in compared to in this improvement in operating profit margin is due to the increase in gross profit margin coupled with the productivity gains 
interest and other expense is comprised of interest  foreign exchange gains and losses  and other miscellaneous non operating income and expenses 
in total  interest and other expenses decreased million in from net interest expense was million in compared to million in this increase is primarily due to increased interest rates and the impact of higher exchange rates on our euro denominated interest expense  offset by higher interest income 
foreign exchange gains and losses primarily result from intercompany transactions between our foreign subsidiaries and the united states 
such gains were million and million in and  respectively 
miscellaneous income expense  net  was income of million in compared to expense of million in the income in includes non operating gains of million per diluted share  primarily related to the sale of our equity interest in a european internet job board during the first quarter of net proceeds from this transaction were million 
we provided for income taxes at a rate of in and in included in the rate is the impact of the non operating gains recorded in the first quarter and the reversal of an million tax contingency reserve in the third quarter 
excluding these items  our rate for would have been 
this rate is higher than the us federal statutory rate of due to higher foreign income tax rates and million of taxes recorded on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries  offset by the tax benefits  including the reversal of million of valuation allowances  of certain internal corporate restructurings and transactions 
net earnings per share diluted increased to in compared to in the higher foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net earnings per share diluted by approximately in on an undiluted basis  net earnings per share was in compared to in during september  the emerging issues task force eitf issued issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share eitf  which requires the effect of contingently convertible debt securities with a market price trigger to be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share  using the if converted method  regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
eitf also requires restatement of previously reported earnings 
our convertible debentures  issued august  have such a feature  and therefore we have restated net earnings per share diluted for all periods since the issuance 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
consolidated results compared to revenues from services increased to billion 
revenues were favorably impacted during the year by changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to the weakening of the us dollar relative to the currencies in most of our non us markets 
in constant currency  revenues increased 
revenue growth in attributable to acquisitions was approximately million or of revenue 
on an organic constant currency basis  revenues increased by 
this growth rate is a result of increased activity in the other operations segment with stable revenue levels in the other markets 
gross profit increased to billion during the gross profit margin declined basis points 
to in from in this decrease was attributable to higher payroll taxes and social costs  increased pricing pressures throughout the world  changes in the service mix of business from higher margin service lines to lower margin service lines and changes in the geographical mix of business as revenue growth in countries with lower gross profit margins  such as france  was higher than in some countries with higher gross profit margins 
gross profit growth from acquisitions was approximately million and had an insignificant impact on gross profit margin 
selling and administrative expenses increased during this increase is primarily due to the changes in exchange rates  as these expenses increased only on a constant currency basis 
as a percent of revenues  selling and administrative expenses were in compared to in this improvement is a result of continued productivity gains and careful expense management in conjunction with growing revenues 
operating profit increased during  however on a constant currency basis  operating profit declined 
the operating profit margin was compared to for the operating profit level primarily reflects the improved leveraging of the business offset by the gross profit margin declines 
acquisitions made during decreased operating profit by approximately million 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  operating profit increased during  however on an organic constant currency basis  operating profit decreased 
acquisitions had no impact to operating profit margin in interest and other expense is comprised of interest  foreign exchange gains and losses  and other miscellaneous non operating income and expenses 
in total  interest and other expense decreased million from to net interest expense was million in and average borrowing levels were lower throughout compared to  however the impact of this was offset by our euro denominated interest expense which was translated at higher rates in foreign exchange gains and losses primarily result from intercompany transactions between our foreign subsidiaries and the united states 
such gains were million and million in and  respectively 
miscellaneous expenses  net  were million in compared to million in in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million million net of tax  or per share related to a writedown of equity security investments where the decline in market value was determined to be other than temporary  as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain debt and equity securities 
we provided for income taxes at a rate of in this rate is higher than the us federal statutory rate of due primarily to the impact of higher foreign income tax rates and valuation reserves recorded against foreign net operating losses 
this rate is lower than the effective tax rate of due to an increase in the foreign tax credits used to offset the us taxes on foreign earnings  offset somewhat by a shift in the mix of taxable income toward countries with relatively higher tax rates 
net earnings per share diluted increased to in compared to in net earnings per share diluted in was positively impacted by the higher foreign currency exchange rates during the year by approximately 
on an undiluted basis  net earnings per share was in compared to in segment results us the united states operation is comprised of company owned branch offices and stand alone franchise offices 
revenues in the united states consist of sales of our company owned branch offices and fees from our franchise operations 
revenues for the year were billion  an increase of  and include franchise fees of million 
franchise fees are primarily based on revenues generated by the franchise network  which were billion in us revenues in millions us operating unit profit in millions revenues in the united states accelerated through the first half of the year  after beginning the year slightly below prior year levels 
revenue growth stabilized in the second half of the year with growth exceeding in both the third and fourth quarters excluding the impact of transpersonnel  our trucking operation that was disposed of in july 
fueling this improving growth was an increase in demand for our light industrial and industrial skilled staff  which represents approximately of our us revenues 
revenue growth from placement of these skills increased nearly from the prior year  reflecting an improvement of the us manufacturing sector 
revenue from office and specialty skills lagged the prior year  however  the rate of contraction improved as we progressed through the year 
the gross profit margin declined compared to the prior year due to increases in employment related costs such as state unemployment taxes and workers compensation 
while we were able to recover a substantial portion of these increases through higher bill rates  the competitive market environment did not allow us to fully recover all of these cost increases 
selling and administrative expenses trended favorably downward during the year  primarily due to a reduction in personnel costs and branch office related costs 
this cost reduction  combined with our revenue growth  reflects strong gains in productivity and our ability to leverage excess capacity across our us branch office network 
operating unit profit for the year increased by to million 
our operating unit profit margin increased to of revenues from  as our productivity enhancements more than offset the decline in gross profit margin 
france revenues in france increased to billion 
in euros  french revenues increased to billion 
the majority of this revenue increase reflects hourly rate increases as volumes increased only slightly during the year 
revenue growth in euro was modest in the first half of the year  growing by  followed by softening in the third quarter to and then accelerating to in the fourth quarter of the year 
gross profit margins declined compared to the prior year  even after excluding adjustments to our estimated liability related to social program remittances in each year 
in  there was an unfavorable adjustment of million  and in  there was a million favorable adjustment 
this decline reflects increasing price competition from large and small competitors  partially due to their expansion of office network capacity during a period of nominal growth in the total staffing market 
france revenues in millions france operating unit profit in millions selling and administrative expenses were well controlled during the year  decreasing slightly from despite continued investment in new offices 
a total of new offices were opened during the year  bringing the total office count to  operating unit profit was million  a decrease of from the prior year 
operating unit profit margin was  a decrease from in operating unit profit was unfavorably impacted by the adjustment for social program remittances in  and favorably impacted by the adjustments in  as discussed above 
during  a new law in france ended the french job center s anpe s control of the placement of the unemployed 
as a result of this law change  temporary staffing companies are allowed to offer placement and recruitment services beginning january  we expect these services will have a long term benefit on our french business  but will not have a significant impact on results due to investments required to grow this service line 
emea the emea region includes our operations in europe  the middle east and africa excluding france  which covers a total of countries delivering services through  offices 
in addition to employment services delivered under the manpower brand  this region also includes elan  which is a leading it recruitment  staffing and managed services firm operating across countries in the region  and brook street  which provides general staffing and recruitment services primarily in the united kingdom

elan comprises of emea revenues 
revenues in emea increased to billion  or in constant currency 
constant currency revenue growth accelerated in the first half of the year and stabilized at for the second half of the year 
fueling this strong revenue growth were investments in new offices  implementation of effective sales initiatives and positive secular trends in the usage of flexible staffing services 
revenue growth improved at all entities in the region  with significant local currency growth coming from belgium  elan  italy and germany 
the gross profit margin for the full year was slightly below the prior year  but was stable with the prior year in the second half of the year 
the decline in gross profit margin is due to competitive pricing pressure in certain markets and changing business mix  partially offset by the favorable impact of growth in permanent placement fees 
selling and administrative expenses increased  or in constant currency 
this growth in expenses reflects the necessary investments to support the rapid revenue growth 
additionally  we were able to achieve significant productivity gains  as we were able to leverage our existing office infrastructure 
operating unit profit more than doubled to million  an increase of  or in constant currency 
the operating unit profit margin increased to from  reflecting the significant productivity gains 
jefferson wells jefferson wells provides highly skilled project personnel along three primary business lines internal audit and controls  technology risk management  tax and finance and accounting compliance 
our services are provided through offices  which include major united states metropolitan markets  toronto and london 
the majority of employees assigned by jefferson wells are full time company employees and therefore employee utilization is a significant factor in determining gross profit margins 
jefferson wells revenues in millions jefferson wells operating unit profit in millions n a n a n a revenues increased dramatically during the year  to million from million in this significant growth was primarily fueled by increased customer demand for technology risk management and internal audit and control services 
included in these services are personnel who assist companies in complying with the sarbanes oxley act legislation 
revenue trends grew sequentially throughout the year  and reached their peak levels in october 
revenues in the fourth quarter were million  down sequentially from the third quarter of this decline  which may continue into  reflects a lower level of demand for our services as companies complete the initial stages of sarbanes oxley compliance 
gross profit margins have improved by more than basis points over the prior year and are in excess of for this improvement primarily reflects the improved utilization of employees assigned to customer engagements 
selling and administrative expenses increased by as we continued to invest in new office openings and additional personnel to support the rapid revenue growth 
as a percentage of revenues  these expenses declined dramatically as we were able to grow into office capacity  in which we had invested in previous years 
operating unit profit was million or of revenue  reflecting the high employee utilization levels and expense leveraging discussed earlier 
right on january   we completed our exchange offer to acquire rmc  the world s largest career transition and organizational consulting services firm  operating through approximately offices in countries 
the results of rmc s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements since that date 
the acquisition of rmc expands the range of services that we offer to customers as a strategic partner through every stage of the employment cycle

right s revenues for the year are million  of which  approximately relates to career transition services and relates to organizational consulting in historically  the career transition services have a higher gross profit margin than the organizational consulting services 
during the first nine months of the year  demand for career transition services declined as the economy improved 
fourth quarter revenues  however  improved sequentially due in part to seasonal factors 
demand for organizational consulting services has improved modestly during the course of the year as companies became more willing to invest in these services with an improving economy 
operating unit profit for the year was million  which is net of million of integration costs related to the merger of empower into rmc 
the operating unit profit margin for the year was 
this below normal operating unit profit margin not only reflects the integration costs discussed above  but also reflects a transition period in adjusting expense levels to support lower revenue levels

other operations revenues in millions other operations operating unit profit in millions revenues in the region improved to billion  or in constant currency 
this strong local currency revenue growth was fueled by south america  japan  mexico  australia and canada 
the gross profit margin improved in the region primarily due to an increase in permanent placement fees 
this improvement was partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin in japan  as increases in social costs were not fully recovered through higher bill rates due to competitive pressures

cash sources and uses cash used to fund our operations is primarily generated through operating activities and our existing credit facilities 
we believe that our internally generated funds and our existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our near term projected cash needs 
our principal ongoing cash needs are to finance working capital  capital expenditures  share repurchases  debt payments  and acquisitions 
working capital is primarily in the form of trade receivables  which generally increase as revenues increase 
the amount of financing necessary to support revenue growth depends on receivable turnover  which differs in each market in which we operate 
during  cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million for and million for the strong results reflect the impact of our focus on working capital management over the past few years 
the change in from is due primarily to the higher working capital requirements to fund the growth in our business  offset by the higher earnings level in accounts receivable increased to  million as of december  from  million as of december  this increase is primarily due to increased business volumes  the acquisition of rmc  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at constant exchange rates  the accounts receivable balance would have been approximately million less than reported

the terms of this agreement are such that transfers do not qualify as a sale of accounts receivable 
accordingly  any advances under this agreement are reflected as debt on the consolidated balance sheets 
prior to an amendment to the agreement in november  transfers of accounts receivable qualified as a sale and the related amount of accounts receivable was removed from our consolidated balance sheets

in october  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of million shares of our common stock  not to exceed a total purchase price of million 
share repurchases may be made from time to time and may be implemented through a variety of methods  including open market purchases  block transactions  privately negotiated transactions  accelerated share repurchase programs  forward repurchase agreements or similar facilities 
this repurchase authorization replaces all previous authorizations 
as of december   there were no shares repurchased under this authorization  however  as of february    shares have been repurchased at a total cost of million 
there were no share repurchases in and a total of  shares at a cost of million were repurchased in under a previous authorization 
during   and  the board of directors declared two cash dividends for a total of   and per share  respectively 
our total dividend payments were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we have aggregate commitments of  million related to debt repayments  operating leases  acquisition related severances and office closure costs  and certain other commitments  as follows in millions thereafter long term debt short term borrowings operating leases acquisition related severances and other office closure costs other we also have entered into guarantee contracts and stand by letters of credit that total approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively million and million for guarantees  respectively  and million and million for stand by letters of credit  respectively 
guarantees primarily relate to indebtedness  bank accounts  and leases 
the stand by letters of credit relate to workers compensation  operating leases and indebtedness 
if certain conditions were met under these arrangements  we would be required to satisfy our obligation in cash 
due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience  we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements 
therefore  they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments identified above 
capital resources total capitalization as of december  was  million  comprised of million in debt and  million in equity 
debt as a percentage of total capitalization was as of december  compared to as of december  this decrease is primarily a result of the equity issued in connection with the acquisition of rmc 
total capitalization in millions debt equity total we have million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of unsecured zero coupon convertible debentures  due august  debentures  with a carrying value of million as of december  these debentures were issued in august at a discount to yield an effective interest rate of per year  and they rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness 
there are no scheduled cash interest payments associated with the debentures 
the debentures are convertible into million shares of our common stock if the closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange exceeds specified levels  or in certain other circumstances 
holders of the debentures may require us to purchase these debentures at the issue price  plus accreted original issue discount  on the first  third  fifth  tenth and fifteenth anniversary dates 
we have the option to settle this obligation in cash  common stock  or a combination thereof 
there were no debentures put to us on the first anniversary date 
on the third anniversary date  million of principal amount at maturity of the debentures was tendered for repurchase  resulting in a payment of approximately million 
our intent is to settle any future put in cash 
in the event of a significant change in the economic environment  we may choose to settle a future put with common stock  which would have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders 
as of august   we may also now call the debentures 
we have million in unsecured notes due march  at  and million in unsecured notes due july  at 
we plan to repay the million notes with cash or other available borrowing facilities when they come due 
see significant matters affecting results of operations and notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in october  we entered into a new million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks that expires in october the new agreement replaces our million five year revolving credit facility and million day revolving credit facility 
amounts borrowed under the million five year facility were transferred to this new facility 
the new revolving credit agreement allows for borrowings in various currencies and up to million may be used for the issuance of stand by letters of credit 
outstanding letters of credit totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
additional borrowings of million were available to us under this new revolving credit agreement as of december  the interest rate and facility fee on the new agreement  as well as the fee paid for the issuance of letters of credit on the facility  vary based on our public debt ratings and borrowing level 
the current interest rate is libor plus 
and the facility and issuance fees are 
and  respectively 
the new agreement requires  among other things  that we comply with a debt to ebitda ratio of less than to and a fixed charge ratio of greater than to as defined in the agreement  we had a debt to ebitda ratio of to and a fixed charge ratio of to as of december  based upon current forecasts  we expect to be in compliance with these covenants throughout the coming year 
there were no borrowings outstanding under our million us commercial paper program as of december  and in addition to the previously mentioned facilities  we maintain separate bank facilities with foreign financial institutions to meet working capital needs of our foreign operations 
as of december   such facilities totaled million  of which million was unused 
our current credit rating from moody s corporation is baa with a stable outlook and our credit rating from standard poor s is bbb with a stable outlook 
both of these credit ratings are investment grade 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
a discussion of the more significant estimates follows 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of our board of directors 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable balance that may not be collected 
this allowance is calculated on an entity by entity basis with consideration for historical write off experience  the current aging of receivables and a specific review for potential bad debts 
items that affect this balance mainly include bad debt expense and write offs of accounts receivable balances 
bad debt expense  which increases our allowance for doubtful accounts  is recorded as a selling and administrative expense and was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
factors that would cause this provision to increase primarily relate to increased bankruptcies by our customers and other difficulties collecting amounts billed 
on the other hand  an improved write off experience and aging of receivables would result in a decrease to the provision 
write offs  which decrease our allowance for doubtful accounts  are recorded as a reduction to our accounts receivable balance and were million  million  and million  for  and  respectively 
employment related items the employment of temporary workers and permanent staff throughout the world results in the recognition of liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans  self insured workers compensation  social program remittances and payroll tax audit exposures that require us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the proper reserve levels 
we sponsor several qualified and nonqualified pension plans covering permanent employees 
the most significant plans are located in the united states  france  the united kingdom  japan and other european countries 
annual expense relating to these plans is recorded as selling and administrative expense  in accordance with the accounting rules generally accepted in the united states 
the calculations of annual pension expense and the pension liability required at year end include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  expected rate of return on plan assets  compensation increases and employee turnover rates 
changes to any of these assumptions will impact the level of annual expense recorded related to the plans 
we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions as necessary 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in the united states  we are self insured in most states for workers compensation claims for our temporary workers 
we determine the proper reserve balance using an actuarial valuation  which considers our historical payment experience and current employee demographics 
our reserve for such claims as of december  and was and million  respectively 
the workers compensation expense is recorded as a component of cost of services 
a significant increase in claims or changes in laws may require us to record more expense related to workers compensation 
on the other hand  significantly improved claim experience may result in a lower annual expense level 
in france  the government has various social programs that are aimed at reducing the cost of labor and encouraging employment  particularly for low wage workers  through the reduction of payroll taxes or social contribution 
a portion of these payroll tax reductions is remitted to our customers in certain circumstances 
we are required to make an estimate for the amount that will be remitted  which is recorded as a reduction of revenue from services 
we make this estimate based on our historical experience  including related trends 
to the extent that our experience differs from our estimate  we will need to make adjustments to our reserve balance  which will impact the results of our french operation 
in addition  future changes to laws governing these payroll tax reductions may require us to revise our estimates  which may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  we reduced our estimated liability related to these remittances by million due to the recent historical trends in the amounts remitted 
on a routine basis  governmental agencies in some of the countries in which we operate will audit our payroll tax calculations and our compliance with other payroll related regulations 
these audits focus primarily on documentation requirements and our support for our payroll tax remittances 
due to the nature of our business  the number of people that we employ  and the complexity of some payroll tax regulations  we may have some adjustments to the payroll tax remittances as a result of these audits 
we make an estimate of the additional remittances that may be required and record the estimate as a component of cost of services 
the estimate is based on the results of past audits  with consideration for changing business volumes and changes to the payroll tax regulations 
to the extent that our actual experience differs from our estimates  we will need to make adjustments to our reserve balance  which will impact the results of the related operation and the operating segment in which it is reported 
in france  we are currently under audit for payroll tax remittances made during and for remittances made during and we have received a preliminary notification related to and have responded to the notification with additional information 
during  we increased our estimated liability related to these remittances by million 
in the netherlands  we are currently under audit for compliance with regulations related to the collection and maintenance of payroll related documents for our temporary employees 
we have not received any notification of findings related to this audit  however we currently do not expect any assessment to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
deferred revenue we recognize revenue under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab generally provides that revenue for time based services be recognized over the average length of the services being provided 
for the career transition line of business  we recognize revenue from individual programs on a straight line basis over the average length of time for candidates to find jobs based on statistically valid data for the specific type of program 
if statistically valid data is not available  then we recognize career transition revenue on a straight line basis over the actual term of the agreements 
for group programs and large projects within the career transition line of business  we defer and recognize revenue over the period in which the contracts are completed 
the difference between the amount billed for career transition services and the amount recognized as revenue is recorded as deferred revenue  which is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
significant factors impacting deferred revenue are the type of programs sold  the level of current billings for new programs and projects  and the average length of the programs 
over time  an increasing volume of new billings will generally result in higher amounts of deferred revenue  while decreasing levels of new billings will generally result in lower amounts of deferred revenue 
as of december   we had million of deferred revenue recorded 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  and tax contingencies 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for which utilization of the asset is not likely 
our judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances recorded 
our net deferred tax assets may need to be adjusted in the event that tax rates are modified  or our estimates of future taxable income change  such that deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled at a different tax rate than currently estimated 
in addition  valuation allowances may need to be adjusted in the event that our estimate of future taxable income changes from the amounts currently estimated 
we have tax contingencies recorded related to items in various countries 
to the extent these items are settled in our favor  a portion of our recorded contingency will be reversed 
to the extent items are settled for an amount greater than the amount we have recorded  an additional tax provision will be recorded 
we provide for income taxes on a quarterly basis based on an estimated annual tax rate 
in determining this rate  we make estimates about taxable income for each of our largest locations worldwide  as well as the tax rate that will be in effect for each location 
to the extent these estimates change during the year  or that actual results differ from these estimates  our estimated annual tax rate may change between quarterly periods and may differ from the actual effective tax rate for the year 
for  we expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment in connection with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to perform goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment reviews  at least annually  using a fair value based approach 
the majority of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets result from our acquisition of rmc 
our remaining goodwill relates primarily to our acquisitions of elan and jefferson wells 
as part of our impairment reviews  we estimate fair value primarily by using a discounted cash flow analysis and  for certain larger reporting units  we may also consider market comparables 
significant assumptions used in this analysis include expected future revenue growth rates  operating unit profit margins  and working capital levels  a discount rate  and a terminal value multiple 
we have completed our annual impairment review for and determined there to be no impairment of either goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets 
we plan to perform our next annual impairment review during the third quarter of we may be required to perform an impairment review prior to our scheduled annual review if certain events occur  including lower than forecasted earnings levels for various reporting units 
in addition  changes to other assumptions could significantly impact our estimate of the fair value of our reporting units 
such a change may result in an impairment charge  which could have a significant impact on the reportable segments that include the related reporting units and our consolidated financial statements 
impact of economic conditions one of the principal attractions of using temporary staffing solutions is to maintain a flexible supply of labor to meet changing economic conditions 
therefore  the industry has been and remains sensitive to economic cycles 
to help minimize the effects of these economic cycles  we offer customers a continuum of services to meet their needs throughout the employment and business cycle 
we believe that the breadth of our operations and the diversity of our service mix cushion us against the impact of an adverse economic cycle in any single country or industry 
however  adverse economic conditions in any of our largest markets  or in several markets simultaneously  would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
legal regulations the temporary employment services industry is closely regulated in all of the major markets in which we operate except the united states and canada 
many countries impose licensing or registration requirements  substantive restrictions on temporary employment services  either on the temporary staffing company or the ultimate client company  or minimum benefits to be paid to the temporary employee either during or following the temporary assignment 
regulations also may restrict the length of temporary assignments  the type of work permitted for temporary workers or the occasions on which temporary workers may be used 
changes in applicable laws or regulations have occurred in the past and are expected in the future to affect the extent to which temporary employment services firms may operate 
these changes could impose additional costs  taxes  record keeping or reporting requirements  restrict the tasks to which temporaries may be assigned  limit the duration of or otherwise impose restrictions on the nature of the temporary relationship with us or the customer  or otherwise adversely affect the industry 
our career transition and organizational consulting services are currently not regulated 
in many markets  the existence or absence of collective bargaining agreements with labor organizations has a significant impact on our operations and the ability of customers to utilize our services 
in some markets  labor agreements are structured on a national or industry wide rather than a company basis 
changes in these collective labor agreements have occurred in the past  are expected to occur in the future  and may have a material impact on the operations of temporary staffing firms  including us 
a search warrant was executed on november   at our french headquarters authorizing the french regional director on inquiries of competition to enter the office and review and obtain documents that may be pertinent to the investigation 
according to the search warrant  the investigation stems from a complaint submitted during to the european commission and subsequently transferred to france s direction generale de la concurrence  de la consommation et de la repression des fraudes 
we understand that the purpose of the investigation is to search for evidence of price fixing and allocation of market share within the french market 
the investigation is continuing and we currently are not able to predict the outcome 
in  the european commission released proposed legislation  the agency workers directive awd  aimed at improving the quality of temporary staffing work through a principle of non discrimination between temporary staff and permanent employees 
the awd has been returned to a consultation and revision phase by the commission and is the subject of strong debate and suggested amendment by a number of member states 
the awd will be discussed in the future  but given the uncertainty surrounding the awd  we cannot currently estimate the impact  if any  on the future results of our european operations or our consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards during may  the fasb financial accounting standards board issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp  which provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the new medicare prescription drug legislation the act 
the act  which was signed into law on december   introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
fsp was adopted by us in the third quarter of and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
during september  the emerging issues task force eitf issued issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share eitf  which requires the effect of contingently convertible debt securities with a market price trigger to be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share  using the if converted method  regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
eitf also requires that previously reported diluted earnings per share be restated 
we adopted eitf in the fourth quarter of see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
during december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as expense in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to expense recognition 
we will adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method in the third quarter of we expect sfas r will have approximately a per share impact on net earnings per share diluted in the second half of during december  the fasb issued fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp  which provides guidance on accounting for the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
the jobs act was enacted on october  fsp states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas based on our analysis to date  we are not yet in a position to decide on whether  or to what extent  we might repatriate foreign earnings under the jobs act 
however  we expect to be in a position to finalize our assessment by june item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information required by this item is set forth in our annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended december   under the heading significant matters affecting results of operations pages to  which information is hereby incorporated herein by reference 
forward looking statements statements made in this report that are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements 
in addition  from time to time  we and our representatives may make statements that are forward looking 
all forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
this section provides you with cautionary statements identifying  for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report or otherwise made by us or on our behalf 
you can identify these forward looking statements by forward looking words such as expect  anticipate  intend  plan  may  will  believe  seek  estimate  and similar expressions 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
the following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in our forward looking statements material changes in the demand from larger customers  including customers with which we have national  multi national  or sole supplier arrangements availability of temporary workers or workers with the skills required by customers increases in the wages paid to temporary workers competitive market pressures  including pricing pressures inability to pass along direct cost increases to customers changes in demand for our specialized services  including assisting companies in complying with the sarbanes oxley act legislation  and career transition services our ability to successfully expand into new markets or offer new service lines our ability to successfully invest in and implement information systems unanticipated technological changes  including obsolescence or impairment of information systems changes in customer attitudes toward the use of staffing services government  tax or regulatory policies adverse to the employment services industry general economic conditions in domestic and international markets interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations difficulties related to acquisitions  including integrating the acquired companies and achieving the expected benefits impairments to the carrying value of acquisitions and other investments resulting from poor financial performance factors disclosed below other factors that may be disclosed from time to time in our sec filings or otherwise some or all of these factors may be beyond our control

we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made 
any significant economic downturn could result in our customers using fewer temporary employees  which would materially adversely affect our business 
because demand for temporary personnel services is sensitive to changes in the level of economic activity  our business may suffer during economic downturns 
as economic activity begins to slow down  companies tend to reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of their regular employees  resulting in decreased demand for temporary personnel 
significant declines in demand  and thus in revenues  can result in expense de leveraging  which would result in lower profit levels 
the worldwide staffing services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry  which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 
the worldwide staffing services market is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry  and in recent years has been undergoing significant consolidation 
we compete in markets throughout north america  south america  europe  australia and asia with full service and specialized temporary service agencies 
several of our competitors  including adecco sa  vedior sa  randstad holding sa and kelly services  inc  have very substantial marketing and financial resources 
price competition in the staffing industry is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing 
we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future  which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 
government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce our future earnings 
in many jurisdictions in which we operate  such as france and germany  the temporary employment industry is heavily regulated 
for example  governmental regulations in germany restrict the length of contracts of temporary employees and the industries in which temporary employees may be used 
in some countries  special taxes  fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of temporary workers 
for example  temporary workers in france are entitled to a allowance for the uncertain duration of employment  which is eliminated if a full time position is offered to them within three days 
the countries in which we operate may create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that we currently provide  impose new or additional benefit requirements  require us to obtain additional licensing to provide staffing services  or increase taxes  such as sales or value added taxes  payable by the providers of staffing services 
any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity because they may make it more difficult or expensive for us to continue to provide staffing services 
our acquisition strategy may have a material adverse effect on our business due to unexpected or underestimated costs 
we acquired elan group limited in for a total purchase price of million and we acquired jefferson wells international  inc in for a purchase price of million 
in addition  we acquired and invested in other companies during for a total consideration of million  million of which was paid in cash 
in  we acquired and invested in other companies for a total consideration of million 
in january  we acquired right management consultants inc  or rmc  by means of an exchange offer for all of rmc s outstanding common stock 
the purchase price for this acquisition is million  the majority of which represents the fair value of shares exchanged and stock options 
we may make acquisitions in the future 
our acquisition strategy involves significant risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services and corporate culture of acquired companies  over valuation by us of acquired companies  insufficient indemnification from the selling parties for legal liabilities incurred by the acquired companies prior to the acquisitions  and diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business because they may result in substantial costs to us and disrupt our business 
in addition  future acquisitions could materially adversely effect our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity because they would likely result in the incurrence of additional debt or dilution  contingent liabilities  an increase in interest expense and amortization expenses related to separately identified intangible assets 
possible impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life  and restructuring charges could also occur 
intense competition may limit our ability to attract  train and retain the qualified personnel necessary for us to meet our customers staffing needs 
we depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified temporary personnel who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of our customers 
we must continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified personnel through recruiting and training programs to keep pace with changing customer needs and emerging technologies 
competition for individuals with proven professional skills  particularly employees with accounting and technological skills  is intense  and we expect demand for such individuals to remain very strong for the foreseeable future 
qualified personnel may not be available to us in sufficient numbers and on terms of employment acceptable to us 
developing and implementing training programs requires significant expenditures and may not result in the trainees developing effective or adequate skills 
we may not be able to develop training programs to respond to our customers changing needs or retain employees who we have trained 
the failure to recruit  train and retain qualified temporary employees could materially adversely affect our business because it may result in an inability to meet our customers staffing needs 
we may be exposed to employment related claims and costs and other litigation that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are in the business of employing people and placing them in the workplaces of other businesses 
risks relating to these activities include claims of misconduct or negligence on the part of our employees  claims by our employees of discrimination or harassment directed at them  including claims relating to actions of our customers  claims related to the employment of illegal aliens or unlicensed personnel  payment of workers compensation claims and other similar claims  violations of wage and hour requirements  retroactive entitlement to employee benefits  errors and omissions of our temporary employees  particularly in the case of professionals  such as accountants  and claims by our customers relating to our employees misuse of customer proprietary information  misappropriation of funds  other criminal activity or torts or other similar claims 
we may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to these problems 
in addition  some or all of these claims may give rise to litigation  which could be time consuming to our management team and costly and could have a negative impact on our business 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience these problems in the future or that our insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover any of these types of liabilities 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will cover all claims that may be asserted against us 
should the ultimate judgments or settlements exceed our insurance coverage  they could have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future or that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we lose our key personnel  then our business may suffer 
our operations are dependent on the continued efforts of our officers and executive management 
in addition  we are dependent on the performance and productivity of our local managers and field personnel 
our ability to attract and retain business is significantly affected by local relationships and the quality of service rendered 
the loss of those key officers and members of executive management who have acquired significant experience in operating an employment services company on an international level may cause a significant disruption to our business 
moreover  the loss of our key managers and field personnel may jeopardize existing customer relationships with businesses that continue to use our services based upon past relationships with these local managers and field personnel 
the loss of such key personnel could materially adversely affect our operations  because it may result in an inability to establish and maintain customer relationships and otherwise operate our business 
some of our subsidiaries might have significant customers  which if lost  could have a material adverse impact on their earnings 
jefferson wells is a global professional services provider of internal audit and controls  technology risk management  tax  finance and accounting services  with operations in the united states and canada and has recently expanded into the united kingdom 
approximately of jefferson wells revenues for were generated from providing services to one customer 
should this customer s demand for our services decrease  this would negatively impact our jefferson wells segment and overall profitability for us as a whole 
foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we conduct our operations in countries and territories and the results of our local operations are reported in the applicable foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable foreign currency exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
during  approximately of our revenues were generated outside of the united states  the majority of which were generated in europe 
furthermore  approximately million of our outstanding indebtedness as of december  was denominated in foreign currencies 
because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars  we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations  in addition to economic exposure 
this exposure could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flow and results of operations in the future because  among other things  it could cause our reported revenues and profitability to decline or debt levels and interest expense to increase 
as of december   we had million of total debt 
this level of debt could adversely affect our operating flexibility and put us at a competitive disadvantage 
our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our credit agreements could have important consequences for investors  including the following we will have to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service rather than for our operations  we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing for future working capital  capital expenditures or other corporate purposes or may have to pay more for such financing  some or all of the debt under our current or future revolving credit facilities may be at a variable interest rate  making us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates  we could be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities  such as acquisition opportunities  and to react to changes in market or industry conditions  we will be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and we may be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less leverage 
the terms of our revolving credit facility permit additional borrowings  subject to certain conditions 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks we now face could intensify 
we expect to obtain the money to pay our expenses  to repay borrowings under our credit facility and to repay our other debt primarily from our operations 
our ability to meet our expenses thus depends on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic and other factors 
we are not able to control many of these factors  such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors 
the money we earn may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and to meet our other debt obligations 
if we do not have enough money  we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt  sell assets or borrow additional funds 
we may not be able to take such actions on terms that are acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  the terms of our existing or future debt agreements  including the revolving credit facilities and our indentures  may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives 
our failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities or a failure to maintain an investment grade rating on our debt could trigger prepayment obligations 
our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could result in us being required to repay these borrowings before their due date 
if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and rates 
certain of our financing agreements require us to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our debt 
as of february   we had such ratings from standard poors and moody s corporation 
if our ratings were lowered  our accounts receivable securitization facility would need to be re negotiated or would no longer be available 
in addition  a lowering of our credit ratings could result in a portion or all of our zero coupon convertible debentures being converted into shares of our common stock 
the holders of our zero coupon convertible debentures could require us to purchase the debentures resulting in dilution in the value of our outstanding common stock or the incurrence of additional debt 
the terms of the zero coupon convertible debentures give holders of the debentures the option to require us to purchase the debentures at the issue price plus accreted original issue discount 
such holders can exercise this option on the first  third  fifth  tenth  and fifteenth anniversary dates 
the next such option date is august  if the option were exercised  we would be required to purchase all or a portion of the debentures through the issuance of common stock  with available cash  or by financing the purchase using other available facilities which could result in dilution of the value of common stock held by our shareholders or the incurrence of a significant amount of additional debt 
the performance of our subsidiaries may vary  negatively affecting our ability to service our debt 
since we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries  our cash flow and our consequent ability to service our debt depends in part upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings  or upon loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries  to us 
the payment of dividends and the making of loans and advances to us by our subsidiaries may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions  depend upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and be subject to various business considerations
