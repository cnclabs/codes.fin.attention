debt conversion and private financing on march   we entered into an agreement with new valley and frost trust  the holders of our then outstanding  aggregate principal amount of senior convertible promissory notes  pursuant to which such parties agreed to convert their notes and accrued interest into common stock 
the debt conversion agreement was subject to approval by our shareholders and to other conditions including the absence of any material adverse change in our financial condition or results of operations 
pursuant to the agreement  new valley and frost trust would convert their notes into approximately  shares of common stock at reduced conversion prices of per share and per share  respectively 
concurrently with the execution of the debt conversion agreement  we entered into an agreement with berliner effektengesellschaft ag  to repurchase  aggregate principal amount of our then outstanding senior convertible promissory notes  plus of accrued interest thereon  for  in cash  which was paid in april as a result  we recorded a gain on debt cancellation of  during the second quarter of we anticipated seeking shareholder approval of the debt conversion agreement at our annual meeting of stockholders originally planned for the second quarter of however  the annual meeting was delayed so that we could re examine our capital needs to support our liquidity and capital base for the near term 
as a result of this examination  we amended the debt conversion agreement to further reduce the conversion prices from to for frost trust and from to for new valley 
in connection with the execution of the amended debt conversion agreement  new valley and frost trust also agreed with us to forbear until may  payment of the interest due to them under their senior convertible promissory notes on the interest payment dates of the notes through march  in order to improve our financial position  we also planed to undertake a private financing whereby we would seek to sell up to  of common stock at per share 
as part of the amended and restated debt conversion agreement  each of frost trust and new valley agreed to commit to invest up to  in the financing if such financing were not fully subscribed for by other investors 
between the time when we signed the original debt conversion agreement and the amended and restated debt conversion agreement  we received three loans from each of new valley and frost trust on september   we borrowed from new valley and from frost trust the september loans 
these loans  which accrued interest at above the prime rate  were due on the earlier of january  or the tenth business day after the consummation of one or more debt or equity financings whereby we receive at least  in aggregate gross proceeds 
the terms of the loans restricted us from incurring or assuming any indebtedness that is not subordinated to the loans so long as the loans were outstanding 

table of contents on november   we borrowed  from new valley and  from frost trust the november loans on the same terms as the september loans 
the proceeds from these loans were used to repay our outstanding  subordinated note payable to an affiliate of our primary clearing broker 
on january   we borrowed  from new valley and  from frost trust the january loans on the same terms as the september loans 
on march   we received a total of  from new valley and frost trust  which represents the  total commitment less the september loans  the november loans  the january loans and related accrued interest of the amended debt conversion and private financing were subject to shareholder approval and to other conditions  including having a registration statement covering the resale of the shares to be issued to new valley and frost trust declared effective by the sec 
our shareholders approved the amended and restated debt conversion agreement and private financing at our annual shareholders meeting which was held on january  and on february   the sec declared the registration statement effective 
the closing of the debt conversion and private financing took place on march  as a result  approximately  of principal and accrued interest was converted into  shares of our common stock  for an average conversion price of approximately per share 
although for accounting purposes  we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately  upon the closing of this transaction  reflecting the expense attributable to the reduction in the conversion price of the notes to be converted  the net effect on our balance sheet was an increase to shareholders equity of approximately  without giving effect to any sale of common stock related to the private financing 
we also received  from each of frost trust and new valley in our private financing  resulting in an additional increase to our shareholders equity of  litigation in november  ladenburg was served with an amended complaint in a lawsuit filed by alan sporn and trident systems  inc in the united states district court for the central district of california adding the company and a number of other firms as defendants 
the amended complaint alleges that ladenburg as well as all other market makers in the plaintiff company s stock  the depository trust company and the national securities clearing corporation  violated section a of the securities act of  various california statutes  and committed common law fraud and negligence  purportedly by engaging in improper short sales of the issuer s stock 
ladenburg s motion to dismiss the claims was granted  and plaintiff was given leave to file an amended complaint 
management believes the claims are without merit and  if an amended complaint is filed  intends to vigorously defend against it 
regulatory investigation in may  the nasd contacted ladenburg regarding an informal investigation into past activities by it  ladenburg capital and certain of their employees involving potential violations of nasd rule and nasd interpretive memorandum c relating to fair prices and commissions 
on september   ladenburg received a wells letter from the staff of the nasd 
the wells letter stated that the staff of the nasd intends to recommend that disciplinary action be brought against ladenburg for violating certain conduct rules of the nasd  including nasd conduct rule and nasd interpretive memorandum c relating to fair prices and commissions  and section b of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the nasd previously delivered similar wells letters to 
table of contents five employees of ladenburg generally alleging violations by them of the same nasd and sec rules 
ladenburg and the nasd have resolved this matter 
on march   without admitting or denying the nasd s allegations or findings  ladenburg consented to entry of an acceptance  waiver and consent in which the nasd found that ladenburg violated nasd conduct rule  nasd interpretive memorandum c  and nasd conduct rules by virtue of violating sections a and of the securities act of  and in connection with the settlement  ladenburg has agreed to reimburse customers approximately  plus interest 
ladenburg will also be censured and pay a fine in the amount of in addition  ladenburg will retain an independent consultant to make recommendations concerning the adequacy of ladenburg s current policies and procedures concerning the above mentioned nasd rules 
the amount of reimbursements due to customers  the fine and related accrued interest is reflected in our statement of operations for the year ended december  and has been reserved for as of december  closing of branch office in september  we closed our retail branch office in great neck  new york  which immediately prior to the closing  consisted of five employees 
most of the employees terminated their employment with us  the balance relocated to our branch office in melville  new york 
financing activities on november   we borrowed the november loans  under the same terms as the september loans 
the proceeds of the loans were used to repay ladenburg s outstanding  junior subordinated revolving credit agreement with an affiliate of its primary clearing broker  which matured on november  in march  these loans and related accrued interest were applied against the  private financing see above 
in addition to the three loans from new valley and frost trust mentioned above  in december  ladenburg received a  temporary cash subordination from each  dr 
phillip frost and new valley  to provide additional regulatory capital required for an underwriting participation 
upon completion of the underwriting during the same month  the  was repaid with interest at the rate of prime plus 
interest amounted to sale of subsidiary effective december   we sold lcfm to an entity owned by three of our directors for  resulting in a gain of which was recorded in our statement of operations for the year ended december   in discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies general 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents clearing arrangements 
ladenburg does not carry accounts for customers or perform custodial functions related to customers securities 
ladenburg introduces all of its customer transactions  which are not reflected in these financial statements  to its primary clearing broker  which maintains the customers accounts and clears such transactions 
additionally  the primary clearing broker provides the clearing and depository operations for ladenburg s proprietary securities transactions 
these activities may expose ladenburg to off balance sheet risk in the event that customers do not fulfill their obligations with the primary clearing broker  as ladenburg has agreed to indemnify its primary clearing broker for any resulting losses 
we continually assess risk associated with each customer who is on margin credit and record an estimated loss when we believe collection from the customer is unlikely 
we incurred losses from these arrangements  prior to any recoupment from our financial consultants  of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
customer claims  litigation and regulatory matters 
in the normal course of business  our operating subsidiaries have been and continue to be the subject of numerous civil actions and arbitrations arising out of customer complaints relating to our activities as a broker dealer  as an employer and as a result of other business activities 
in general  in addition to the litigation with the landlord discussed below  the cases involve various allegations that our employees had mishandled customer accounts 
due to the uncertain nature of litigation in general  we are unable to estimate a range of possible loss related to lawsuits filed against us  but based on our historical experience and consultation with counsel  we typically reserve an amount we believe will be sufficient to cover any damages assessed against us 
we have accrued  and  for potential arbitration and lawsuit losses as of december  and  respectively 
however  we have in the past been assessed damages that exceeded our reserves 
if we misjudged the amount of damages that may be assessed against us from pending or threatened claims  or if we are unable to adequately estimate the amount of damages that will be assessed against us from claims that arise in the future and reserve accordingly  our operating income would be reduced 
such costs may have a material adverse effect on our future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
september  events 
on september   terrorists attacked the world trade center complex in new york  which subsequently collapsed and damaged surrounding buildings  including one occupied by a branch office of ladenburg capital 
these events resulted in the suspension of trading of us equity securities for four business days and precipitated the relocation of approximately employees to ladenburg s mid town new york headquarters 
some of ladenburg s and ladenburg capital s business was temporarily disrupted 
we are insured for loss caused by physical damage to property  including repair or replacement of property 
we are also insured for lost profits due to business interruption  including costs related to lack of access to facilities 
we will record future reimbursements from insurance proceeds related to certain september  expenses when the reimbursements are actually received 
although the claim to the insurance carrier is significantly greater  the net book value of the lost property  as well as the costs incurred to temporarily replace some of the lost property  has been recorded as a receivable as of december  we received insurance proceeds of in july representing an advance relating to damaged property  which was applied against our receivable 
the receivable balance as of december   representing the net book value of the damaged property and subsequent construction costs  was  in october  we filed a proof of loss with the insurance carrier  for an amount in excess of the policy limits of approximately  and in july  we filed a lawsuit against the insurance carrier for failure to pay for damages we incurred 
there are no assurances  however  that we will recover the full amount of insurance available to ladenburg and ladenburg capital as a result of this claim 
ladenburg capital is currently in litigation with its landlord seeking a declaratory judgment that the lease in this building near the world trade center be deemed terminated because  among other things  
table of contents the premises were unsafe and uninhabitable for a period of days after september   pursuant to a lease provision giving ladenburg capital the right to terminate in those circumstances 
we believe that ladenburg capital will prevail and intend to pursue this claim vigorously 
however  in the event that ladenburg capital does not prevail  it may incur additional future expenses to terminate the long term commitment or  to the extent of foregone rental income in the event ladenburg capital does not sublease the office space for an amount at least equal to the lease obligations 
such costs may have a material adverse effect on ladenburg capital s financial position and liquidity 
exit or disposal activities 
during the fourth quarter of  we early adopted sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
under sfas no 
 a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
for operating leases  a liability for costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its remaining term without economic benefit to the entity shall be recognized and measured at its fair value when the entity ceases using the right conveyed by the lease the cease use date 
the fair value of the liability at the cease use date shall be determined based on the remaining lease rentals  reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property 
in may  ladenburg relocated approximately of its employees from its new york city office to its melville  new york office 
as a result of this move  ladenburg ceased using one of the several floors it occupies in its new york city office  and the net book value of the leasehold improvements was written off 
in september  ladenburg subleased this floor for the remaining term of its lease 
the fair value of ladenburg s obligation with respect to the lease was approximately  at inception of the sublease and approximated the balance of our deferred rent liability relating to such space 
accordingly  no charge to operations was required in connection with the sublease 
in the third quarter of  ladenburg ceased using a portion of another floor of its new york city office 
accordingly  the related leasehold improvements were written off 
in conjunction with the write off of these leasehold improvements  the unamortized deferred rent credit representing reimbursement from the landlord of such leasehold improvements was also written off in the third quarter of the write off of leasehold improvements  net of accumulated amortization  and the write off of the unamortized deferred rent credit resulted in a net charge to operations of in november  ladenburg subleased the space through june   for a sub rental equal to its lease commitment with the landlord  through the sublease period 
fair value 
trading securities owned and securities sold  but not yet purchased on our consolidated statements of financial condition are carried at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value  with related unrealized gains and losses recognized in our results of operations 
the determination of fair value is fundamental to our financial condition and results of operations and  in certain circumstances  it requires management to make complex judgments 
fair values are based on listed market prices  where possible 
if listed market prices are not available or if the liquidation of our positions would reasonably be expected to impact market prices  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors  including dealer price quotations 
fair values for certain derivative contracts are derived from pricing models that consider market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce 
table of contents different financial results 
changes in the fixed income and equity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future  potentially affecting principal trading revenues 
the illiquid nature of certain securities or debt instruments also requires a high degree of judgment in determining fair value due to the lack of listed market prices and the potential impact of the liquidation of our position on market prices  among other factors 
impairment of goodwill 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and were required to analyze our goodwill for impairment issues on january  and on a periodic basis thereafter 
in connection with the reporting of results for the second quarter of  based on the overall declines in the us equity markets and the conditions prevailing in the broker dealer industry  we engaged an independent appraisal firm to value our goodwill as of june  based on this valuation  an impairment charge of  of goodwill was indicated and recorded in september the goodwill was generated in the ladenburg acquisition in may  and the charge reflected overall market declines since the acquisition 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the adoption of sfas no 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we account for taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expense on the timing differences between the tax basis and book basis of its assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those timing differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax amounts as of december   which consist principally of the tax benefit of net operating loss carryforwards and accrued expenses  amount to  after consideration of all the evidence  both positive and negative  especially the fact we have sustained recurring operating losses and that we continue to be affected by conditions in the economy  we have determined that a valuation allowance at december  was necessary to fully offset the deferred tax assets based on the likelihood of future realization 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  expiring in various years from through the company s ability to use such carryforwards to reduce future taxable income is subject to limitations attributable to equity transactions in march see recent developments debt conversion and private financing that have resulted in a change of ownership as defined in internal revenue code section 
expense recognition of employee stock options 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
r  shared based payment sfas r  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
proforma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
that cost will be recognized as compensation expense over the service period  which would normally be the vesting period 
sfas r will be effective upon us beginning july  as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method could have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future

in connection with the reporting of the results for the second quarter of  based on the overall declines in the us equity markets and the conditions prevailing in the broker dealer industry  the company completed an additional impairment review and recorded a  charge for the impairment of goodwill  which was generated in the ladenburg acquisition 
the charge reflected the overall market declines since the acquisition in may during this review  an independent appraisal firm was engaged to value the company s goodwill as of june  the appraiser valued the businesses using a weighted average of each unit s projected discounted cash flow  with a weighted average cost of capital of  and a fair market approach using market comparables for ten companies

in accordance with sfas no 
 we have evaluated our liability with respect to this space  taking into account estimated future lease payments that could be reasonably obtained for the property 
in this evaluation  we concluded that the net book value of the leasehold improvements should be written off 
accordingly  the unamortized deferred rent credit representing reimbursement from the landlord of such leasehold improvements was also written off

liquidity and capital resources approximately of our assets at december  are highly liquid  consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents  trading securities owned and receivables from clearing brokers  all of which fluctuate  depending upon the levels of customer business and trading activity 
receivables from broker dealers  which are primarily from our primary clearing broker  turn over rapidly 
as a securities dealer  we may carry significant levels of securities inventories to meet customer needs 
a relatively small percentage of our total assets are fixed 
the total assets or the individual components of total assets may vary significantly from period to period because of changes relating to economic and market conditions  and proprietary trading strategies 
ladenburg is subject to the net capital rules of the sec 
therefore  it is subject to certain restrictions on the use of capital and its related liquidity 
ladenburg s regulatory net capital  as defined  of  exceeded minimum capital requirements of by  at december  failure to maintain the required net capital may subject ladenburg to suspension or expulsion by the nyse  the sec and other regulatory bodies and ultimately may require its liquidation 
the net capital rule also prohibits the payment of dividends  redemption of stock and prepayment or payment of principal of subordinated indebtedness if net capital  after giving effect to the payment  redemption or prepayment  would be less than specified percentages of the minimum net capital requirement 
compliance with the net capital rule could limit the operations of ladenburg that requires the intensive use of capital  such as underwriting and trading activities  and also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital from it  which in turn  could limit our ability to pay dividends and repay and service our debt 
in june  we closed our ft 
lauderdale office  which constituted all of our market making activities 
as a result of our decision to eliminate our market making activities  effective june   our minimum net capital requirement decreased from  to ladenburg  as guarantor of its customer accounts to its primary clearing broker  is exposed to off balance sheet risks in the event that its customers do not fulfill their obligations with the clearing broker 
in addition  to the extent ladenburg maintains a short position in certain securities  it is exposed to future off balance sheet market risk  since its ultimate obligation may exceed the amount recognized in the financial statements

this lawsuit is pending in bankruptcy court due to the landlord s bankruptcy filing 
if ladenburg capital is not successful in this litigation  it plans to sublease the property 
ladenburg capital has provided for estimated costs in connection with this lease and has recorded a liability at december  and additional costs may be incurred in connection with terminating this lease  or if not terminated  to the extent of foregone rental income in the event ladenburg capital does not sublease the office space for an amount at least equal to the lease obligations 
such costs may have a material adverse effect on ladenburg capital s financial position and liquidity 
in conjunction with the may acquisition of ladenburg  we issued a total of  principal amount of senior convertible promissory notes due december  to new valley  berliner effektengesellschaft ag and frost nevada which was subsequently assigned to frost trust

in connection with the execution of the amended debt conversion agreement  new valley and frost trust also agreed with us to forbear until may  payment of the interest due to them under their senior convertible promissory notes on the interest payment dates of the notes through march  in order to improve our financial position  we also planed to undertake a private financing whereby we would seek to sell up to  of common stock at per share

phillip frost and new valley  to provide additional regulatory capital required for an underwriting participation 
upon completion of the underwriting during the same month  the  was repaid with interest at the rate of prime plus 
interest amounted to in the normal course of business  our operating subsidiaries have been and continue to be the subject of numerous civil actions and arbitrations arising out of customer complaints relating to our activities as a broker dealer  as an employer and as a result of other business activities 
in general  the cases involve various allegations that our employees had mishandled customer accounts 
we believe that  based on our historical experience and the reserves established by us  the resolution of the claims presently pending will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  although we typically reserve an amount we believe will be sufficient to cover any damages assessed against us  we have in the past been assessed damages that exceeded our reserves 
if we misjudged the amount of damages that may be assessed against us from pending or threatened claims  or if we are unable to adequately estimate the amount of damages that will be assessed against us from claims that arise in the future and reserve accordingly  our financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
our liquidity position continues to be adversely affected by our inability to generate cash from operations 
accordingly  we have been forced to cut expenses as necessary 
in order to accomplish this  we have implemented certain cost cutting procedures throughout our operations including reducing the size of our workforce 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  in order to reduce future operating expenses  we terminated the operations of ladenburg capital and withdrew it as a broker dealer 
ladenburg capital filed at that time to withdraw as a broker dealer  which withdrawal became effective in january ladenburg has agreed to and is currently servicing the accounts of ladenburg capital and many of the employees of ladenburg capital were offered and have accepted employment with ladenburg 
the termination of ladenburg capital s operations reduced support expenses  operating expenses and general administrative expenses 
as a result of decreased revenues  we have continued to reduce expenses 
after reviewing our current operations and financial position  we believe we have adequate cash and regulatory capital to fund our projected operating activities through december  our overall capital and funding needs are continually reviewed to ensure that our liquidity and capital base can support the estimated needs of our business units 
these reviews take into account business needs as well as regulatory capital requirements of the subsidiary 
if  based on these reviews  it is determined that we require additional funds to support our liquidity and capital base  we would seek to raise additional capital through available sources  including through borrowing additional funds on a short 
table of contents term basis from new valley or from other parties  including our shareholders and clearing brokers 
additionally  we may seek to raise money through a rights offering or other type of financing 
if we continue to be unable to generate cash from operations and are unable to find alternative sources of funding as described above  it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations
