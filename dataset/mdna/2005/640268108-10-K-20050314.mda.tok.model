the shares shown above retroactively reflect a two for one split  effective august  we changed our method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets on january  in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as in part i of this report under the heading risk factors 
overview our business is to create high value products through the application of advanced drug delivery 
we have three drug delivery technology platforms that are designed to improve the performance of molecules 
these platforms are nektar advanced pegylation technology  nektar pulmonary technology and nektar supercritical fluid scf technology 
our mission is to develop superior therapeutics to make a difference in patients lives 
we pursue our mission in two ways 
first  we partner with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that seek to improve and differentiate their products 
in addition  we are in the early stages of development of our own proprietary products 
we are working to become one of the world s leading drug delivery products companies 
to date the revenues we have received from the sales of our products and in connection with our collaborative arrangements have been insufficient to meet our operating and other expenses 
except for sales from certain products using nektar advanced pegylation technology  we have not sold any commercial products and do not anticipate receiving significant revenue from product sales or royalties in the near future 
the development of a successful product is dependent upon several factors that are outside of our control 
these include  among other things  the need to obtain regulatory approval to market these products and our dependence upon our collaborative partners 
as a result of these or other risks  potential products for which we have invested substantial amounts in research and development may never produce revenues or income 
we have generally been compensated for research and development expenses during initial feasibility work performed under collaborative arrangements for all three of our technologies nektar advanced pegylation technology  nektar pulmonary technology  and nektar supercritical fluid technology 
prior to commercialization of pulmonary delivery and advanced pegylation products  we receive revenues from our partners for partial or full funding of research and development activities and progress payments upon achievement of certain developmental milestones 
in a typical advanced pegylation technology collaboration  we manufacture and supply the polyethylene glycol peg reagents and receive manufacturing revenues and possible royalties from sales of the commercial product 
in a typical pulmonary technology collaboration  our partner will provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient the majority of which are already approved by the fda in another delivery form  fund clinical and formulation development  obtain regulatory approvals  and market the resulting commercial product 
we may manufacture and supply the drug delivery approach or drug formulation  and may receive revenues from drug manufacturing  as well as royalties from sales of most commercial products 
in addition  for products using our pulmonary technology  we may receive revenues from the supply of our device for the product along with revenues for any applicable drug processing or filling 
in addition to our partner funded programs  we are applying our technologies independently through internal proprietary product development efforts 
to achieve and sustain profitable operations  we  alone or with others  must successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture  introduce  market  and sell products using our drug delivery and other drug delivery systems 
there can be no assurance that we can generate sufficient product or contract research revenue to become profitable or to sustain profitability 
to fund the substantial expense related to our research and development activities  we have raised significant amounts of capital through the sale of our equity and convertible debt securities 
as of december   we had approximately million in long term convertible subordinated notes and debentures  million in non current capital lease obligations  and million in other long term debt 
our ability to meet the repayment obligations of this debt is dependent upon our ability to develop successful products without significant delay or expense 
even if we are successful in this regard  we will likely require additional capital to repay our debt obligations 

table of contents we do not expect that sales of our currently marketed products will be sufficient for us to achieve profitability 
our ability to achieve profitability is dependent on the approval of and successful marketing of products with significant markets  and for which we realize relatively higher royalties 
recent developments in march  we reported that pfizer inc and the sanofi aventis group announced that the united states food and drug administration fda had accepted for filing a new drug application for exubera inhaled insulin 
pfizer inc and sanofi aventis stated that they intended to seek approval to market exubera for adult patients with type and type diabetes and they also stated that exubera has been studied in more than  patients  and in some of these patients for more than seven years 
in december   we reported that eyetech pharmaceuticals  inc and pfizer inc announced that fda had approved macugen pegaptanib sodium injection for use in the treatment of neovascular wet age related macular degeneration amd  an eye disease associated with aging that destroys central vision 
this is the sixth product using our advanced pegylation technology approved for use in the us in september  pfizer and sanofi aventis presented new data from a trial whose primary objective was to assess long term pulmonary safety that showed that exubera was effective and well tolerated in controlling blood glucose levels over a two year period in patients with type diabetes 
during and january  we announced five new collaborative agreements with pfizer  glaxosmithkline  bayer  zelos  and one undisclosed biotechnology company 
we currently have four development programs underway through our proprietary products group  including one product that has entered a phase i clinical trial  one that has entered proof of concept clinical testing  and two in pre clinical testing 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb released a revision to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas r 
fas r addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
we will be required to adopt fas r on july  when we adopt the new statement  we will have to recognize substantially more compensation expense 
this will have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the effect of adopting fas r 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
statement addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning july  we do not believe adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of also in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the 
table of contents american jobs creations act of we do not expect the adoption of these new tax accounting standards to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in november  the fasb released sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment to arb no 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as defined by arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we will be required to adopt sfas no 
on january  we are currently in the process of evaluating the effect of adopting sfas no 
in june  the fasb emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  whether an investor should apply the equity method of accounting to investments other than common stock 
eitf addresses whether the equity method of accounting applies when an investor does not have an investment in voting common stock of an investee but exercises significant influence through other means 
the accounting provisions of eitf are effective for reporting periods beginning after september  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our consolidated financials position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in march  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance regarding disclosures about unrealized losses on available for sale debt and equity securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
in september  the eitf delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance  however the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june  see note 
we have complied with the disclosure requirements of eitf  and we will evaluate the impact of the measurement and recognition provisions of eitf once final guidance is issued 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
it requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of each of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board released a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas r 
fas r addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
we will be required to adopt fas r on july  when we adopt the new statement  we will have to recognize substantially more compensation expense 
this would have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the effect of adopting fas r 

table of contents we currently apply the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for those plans 
under this opinion  no stock based employee compensation expense is charged for options that were granted at an exercise price that was equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
stock compensation costs are immediately recognized to the extent the exercise price is below the fair value on the date of grant and no future vesting criteria exist 
for stock awards issued below our market price on the date of grant  we record deferred compensation representing the difference between the price per share of stock award issued and the fair value of the company s common stock at the time of issuance or grant  and we amortize this amount over the related vesting periods on a straight line basis 
pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share required by sfas  as amended by sfas  regarding the fair value for employee options and employee stock purchase plan shares was estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions risk free interest rate dividend yield volatility factor weighted average expected life years years years the black scholes options valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
we have presented the pro forma net loss and pro forma basic and diluted net loss per common share using the assumptions noted above 
the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas to stock based employee compensation in thousands  except per share information years ended december  net loss  as reported add stock based employee compensation included in reported net loss deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value methods for all awards pro forma net loss net loss per share basic and diluted  as reported basic and diluted  pro forma cash  cash equivalents and investments we consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits held in banks  interest bearing money market funds  commercial paper  federal and municipal government securities  and repurchase agreements 

table of contents short term investments consist of federal and municipal government securities  corporate bonds  and commercial paper with a  f  or p short term ratings and a or better long term ratings with remaining maturities at date of purchase of greater than days and less than two years 
at december   all short term investments are designated as available for sale and are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
short term investments are adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities  if any  are included in other income expense 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest income 
impairment of goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below our carrying value 
we performed our annual impairment test and determined that on a consolidated basis  the undiscounted cash flow from our long range forecast exceeds the carrying amount of our goodwill 
the carrying value of goodwill is million as of december  and goodwill will be tested for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step is to compare our fair value to our net asset value  including goodwill 
if the fair value is greater than our net asset value  goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step is not required 
if the fair value is less than our net asset value  the second step of the impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the impairment test is to compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in the same manner that goodwill is calculated in a business combination  whereby the fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if they had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was the purchase price 
the excess purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities would be the implied fair value of goodwill 
the impairment tests for goodwill are performed at the corporate entity level  which we have identified to be our only reporting unit 
in the future  we may determine that impairment tests should be performed at a level below the reporting unit level  depending on whether certain criteria are met 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we perform a test for recoverability of our intangible and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized only if the carrying amount of an intangible or long lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset 
to date  there have been no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  and therefore we have determined that there has been no impairment on our intangible and other long lived assets  including capitalized assets related to exubera 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangibles and long lived assets  we have concluded that there is no impairment in the carrying value of these assets as of december  if this assessment changes in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
the carrying value of our purchased intangibles as of december  and is million and million  respectively 
these assets are scheduled to be fully amortized by december the carrying value of our other long lived assets as of december  and is million and million  respectively 

table of contents judgments impacting fixed asset capitalization for exubera in accordance with sfas  accounting for research and development costs  we have expensed certain amounts paid for plant design  engineering  and validation costs for the automated assembly line equipment that will be used in connection with the manufacture of the inhaler device for exubera because such costs have no alternative future use 
the total amount expensed was million  million  and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december   the capitalized net book value of the automated assembly line equipment located at our contract manufactures sites totals million 
these assets are intended to be used in connection with the manufacture of the inhaler device for exubera 
the total amount capitalized amounted to million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these amounts have been capitalized based upon our determination that the related assets have alternative future use and therefore have separate economic or realizable value 
inventory reserves we perform quality control reviews of our raw materials and finished goods 
we record inventory reserves based upon specific identification of potentially defective raw material and finished goods batches 
in addition  we record an inspection reserve based on a historical estimate of finished goods that ultimately fail quality control 
we generally do not maintain inventory reserves based on obsolescence or risk of competition because the shelf life of our products is long 
however  if our current assumptions about demand or obsolescence were to change  additional inventory reserves may be needed  which could negatively impact our product gross margins 
our inventory reserves were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
this represented and of gross inventory as of december  and  respectively 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
effective july   we adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables on a prospective basis 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowances are established for uncollectible amounts 
we enter into collaborative research and development arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners that may involve multiple deliverables 
for multiple deliverable arrangements entered into after july  judgment is required in the areas of separability of units of accounting and the fair value of individual elements 
the principles and guidance outlined in eitf no 
provide a framework to a determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting  and b determine how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
our arrangements may contain the following elements collaborative research  milestones  manufacturing and supply  royalties and license fees 
for each separate unit of accounting we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value using available internal evidence for the undelivered item s and our arrangements generally do not contain a general right of return relative to the delivered item 
in accordance with the guidance in eitf no 
 the company uses the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration when it does not have fair value of a delivered item s 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered item equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
contract revenue from collaborative research and feasibility agreements is recorded when earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
advance payments for research and development revenue received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
revenue from collaborative research 
table of contents and feasibility arrangements are recognized as the related costs are incurred 
amounts received under these arrangements are generally non refundable if the research effort is unsuccessful 
payments received for milestones achieved are deferred and recorded as revenue ratably over the next period of continued development 
management makes its best estimate of the period of time until the next milestone is reached 
this estimate affects the recognition of revenue for completion of the previous milestone 
the original estimate is periodically evaluated to determine if circumstances have caused the estimate to change and if so  amortization of revenue is adjusted prospectively 
product sales are derived primarily from cost plus manufacturing and supply contracts for our peg reagents with individual customers in our industry 
sales terms for specific peg reagents are negotiated in advance 
revenues related to our product sales are recorded in accordance with the terms of the contracts 
no provisions for potential product returns have been made to date because we have not experienced any significant returns from our customers 
restatement certain prior year amounts reported in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   as amended  have been restated to correct for misapplications of generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap 
also  certain amounts reported in our quarterly reports on form q during the years and have been restated to correct for these misapplications of our accounting policies related to gaap refer to footnote in item of this annual report on form k 
these reclassifications did not result in any change to our cash position  revenue  or net loss for the years ended december  and december  or for any quarterly period during the years ended december  or the specific misapplications of gaap that lead to this conclusion are as follows we have reclassified approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  from research and development expenses to general and administrative expenses 
this reclassification included legal expenses related to our intellectual property portfolio and a portion of finance  information systems  and human resource expenses that were not clearly related to research and development and are required to be classified outside research and development expenses under statement financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for research and development costs 
we reclassified approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  from general and administrative expenses to interest expense 
this reclassification was made to record the amortization of debt issuance costs to interest expense as required under accounting principles board no 
 interest on receivables and payables and eitf increasing rate debt 
material weakness and remediation in connection with management s assessment of its internal control over financial reporting as of december   we have concluded that we have a material weakness in our financial statement close process  including insufficient review of the following the application of our accounting policies and disclosures in the notes to our financial statements 
this material weakness in our financial statement close process arises from staff with inadequate proficiency to apply the company s accounting policies in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

table of contents this material weakness impacts our ability to report financial information in conformity with gaap  which could affect all significant financial statement accounts and has resulted in i a restatement of the and consolidated financial statements to reflect reclassifications of certain amounts between research and development expense  general and administrative expense  and interest expense  ii a restatement of all four quarters of and the first three quarters of to reflect reclassifications of certain amounts between research and development expense  general and administrative expense and interest expense  and iii the prior restatement of the consolidated financial statements to reduce the gain on debt extinguishment 
in  we began implementation of new processes and controls and hired additional personnel with technical accounting expertise to improve our financial statement close process 
we intend to continue to improve our financial statement close process in including the remediation of the material weakness discussed above by identifying  recruiting  and training personnel with the appropriate accounting skills 
in addition  we plan to further enhance our technical accounting review process for non routine and complex transactions by identifying and defining non routine and complex transactions on a regular basis  and researching  identifying  analyzing  documenting  and reviewing applicable accounting principles 
our efforts to comply with section of sox and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and the audit of that assessment by our registered public accounting firm has required  and continues to require  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
our internal control systems are designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and our board of directors that our internal control over financial reporting is adequate  but there can be no guarantee that such controls will be effective 
the continuing uncertainty that we will meet or continue to meet the requirements of these laws  regulations  and standards  may negatively impact our business operations and financial position 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue in thousands except percentages increase decrease vs increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs contract revenue product revenue total revenue total revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total revenue increased in compared to and increased in compared to contract research revenue included reimbursed research and development expenses as well as the amortization of deferred up front signing and milestone payments received from our collaborative partners 
contract revenues are expected to fluctuate from year to year  and future contract revenue cannot be predicted accurately 
the level of contract revenues depends in part upon the continuation of existing collaborations  signing of new collaborations  and achievement of milestones under current and future agreements 
contract research revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in contract research revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  
table of contents was due primarily to an million increase in contract research revenue from pfizer related to the exubera collaboration and a million payment received from aventis behring related to the termination of their collaboration with us 
product revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
product sales accounted for of revenues for the year ended december   as compared to and of revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in product revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was due primarily to lower demand 
this resulted in lower sales of the following commercially approved products neulasta  somavert  and pegasys 
these reductions in sales volume were partially offset by an increase in revenue related to cdp for phase iii clinical supplies 
the increase in contract research revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  was due primarily to increased activities under our existing collaboration agreements with chiron corporation and solvay pharmaceuticals  inc the increase in product revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to higher sales of neulasta  somavert  and pegasys 
future product sales are dependent upon regulatory approval of new products for sale and adoption of current products in the market

the decrease in product gross margin for the year ended december  compared to december  was primarily due to the following production problems encountered during the second and third quarter of resulted in a temporary shut down of part of our manufacturing operations 
this resulted in lower overhead absorption 
the excess overhead not absorbed was expensed to cost of goods sold 
as of december   we are confident that the manufacturing problems are being satisfactorily addressed 
as of january   we refined our methodology to allocate additional operating expenses which resulted in more overhead being allocated to production 
inventory reserves increased million during the year ended december  from million at december  to million at december  the reserve represented and of gross inventory as of december  and  respectively 
this increase in the percentage of inventory reserved was due to a larger general reserve for defective batches 

table of contents the decrease in product gross margin for the year ended december  compared to december  was primarily due to changes in product mix and an increase to inventory reserves of from million to million 
the increase was due to the establishment of a reserve for specifically identified failed batches

research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to increased spending relating to commercial readiness of exubera as well as increased internally funded development spending 
we expect research and development spending to increase over the next few years as we continue to fund development of our technologies  and because of increased spending associated with the development of internally funded proprietary products 
while we believe our proprietary products strategy may result in improved economics for any products ultimately developed and approved  it will require us to invest significant funds in developing these products without reimbursement from a collaborative partner 
the decrease in research and development expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable a deferral of certain research and development efforts into fiscal year  as well as a workforce reduction completed in december we have reclassified approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  from research and development expenses to general and administrative expenses

in addition to our partnered product programs  we have four proprietary products in the early stages of development 
one of these products involves an inhaled small molecule that has entered phase i and another product is in proof of concept human studies 
the remaining two products are in preclinical testing

generally  for partnered projects  advancement from one phase to the next and the related costs to do so is dependent upon factors that are primarily controlled by our partners 
our research and development activities can be divided into research and preclinical programs  clinical development programs and commercial readiness

general and administrative spending during the year ended december  was comparable to spending during the year ended december  we expect general and administrative spending to increase over the next few years to support increased activities in most areas of our operations 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to december  was primarily due to the lack of marketing expenditures which we had incurred throughout related to our name change in january  as well as a workforce reduction completed in december we have reclassified approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  from research and development expenses to general and administrative expenses

under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain

cash flows used or provided for investing activities for the year ended december    and were driven primarily by the purchase  sale  and maturity of investment securities 
these cash proceeds were either reinvested or used in operations 
we purchased property and equipment of approximately million  million  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in purchased property and equipment in as compared to primarily reflects the cost of improvements made to our huntsville  al facility as well as capital expenditures made in preparation for a potential commercial launch of exubera

table of contents in march  we entered into an underwriting agreement with lehman brothers inc pursuant to which we sold million shares of our common stock at a price of per common share for proceeds of approximately million  net of issuance costs 
the proceeds are to be used for general corporate purposes  which may include investing in or accelerating various product development programs  including exubera  undertaking potential acquisitions  developing technologies  and retiring our outstanding debt 
in march  we called for the full redemption of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due june the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the notes at the time of the call for redemption was million  all of which was converted into approximately million shares of common stock prior to the redemption date 
in connection with the conversion  we agreed to pay per  of the notes to be converted  for an aggregate payment of approximately million

in january  certain holders of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due october completed an exchange and cancellation of million in aggregate principal amount of the notes for the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock in a privately negotiated transaction 
as a result of the transactions related to convertible subordinated debt during the year ended december   our total contractual obligation with regard to convertible subordinated debt has decreased from million at december  to million at december  all of our outstanding convertible subordinated debt as of december  will mature in given our current cash requirements  we forecast that we will have sufficient cash to meet our net operating expense requirements for at least the next two years 
we plan to continue to invest in our growth and the need for cash will be dependent upon the timing of these investments 
our capital needs will depend on many factors  including continued progress in our research and development arrangements  progress with preclinical and clinical trials of our proprietary and partnered products  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of developing and scaling up each manufacturing operation of our technologies  the timing and cost of our clinical and commercial production facilities  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  the need to acquire licenses to new technologies  and the status of competitive products 
the entire outstanding balance of convertible subordinated debt as of december  of million will mature in we are not likely to be able to satisfy this entire obligation through cash flow generated by our operations 
to satisfy our long term needs  we intend to seek additional funding  as necessary  from corporate partners and from the sale of securities 
because we are an early stage biotechnology company  we do not qualify to issue investment grade debt or have access to certain credit facilities 
as a result  any financing we undertake will likely involve the issuance of equity  convertible debt instruments or high yield debt to fund our working capital 
to date we have been primarily dependent upon equity and convertible debt financings for capital and have incurred substantial debt as a result of our issuances of subordinated notes and debentures that are convertible into our common stock 
our substantial debt  the market price of our securities  and the general economic climate  among other factors  could have material consequences for our financial position and could affect our sources of short term and long term funding 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if and when required  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and maintain a weighted average maturity of one year or less 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease  less than  in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  this potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our investment securities at december  actual results may differ materially 
the same hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate million decrease  less than  in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  foreign currency risk our operations include research and development  manufacturing  and sales activities in the us and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have exposure 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  most significantly the british pound 
to limit our economic exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to british pounds  we periodically purchase british pounds on the spot market and hold in a us bank account 
at december   we held british pounds valued at approximately million in a us bank account  using the exchange rate as of period end 
this amount is included in cash on our balance sheet 
during the year ended 
table of contents december   an immaterial amount of losses resulting from revaluing british pounds at the current exchange rate were included in other income expense 
as part of our risk management strategy  we may decide to use derivative instruments  including forwards  foreign currency swaps and options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures  however  to date we have not entered into any such derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
a hypothetical increase in the us dollar relative to the british pound as of december   would have resulted in an additional million of foreign exchange loss on the british pounds held in our account in the us for the year ended december  we did not hold british pounds in a us bank account during the year ended december  interest rate risk on our convertible subordinated notes increases in the interest rates and fluctuations in our stock price could affect the fair market value of our convertible subordinated notes and debentures  which pay a fixed rate of interest 
as of december   we had approximately million in outstanding convertible subordinated notes and debentures with a fair value of million 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease and a million decrease in the fair value of our convertible subordinated debentures as of december  and  respectively
