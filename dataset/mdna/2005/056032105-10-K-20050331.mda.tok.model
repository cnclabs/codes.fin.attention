item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture  sell and support advanced thermal processing systems used primarily for semiconductor packaging  printed circuit boards pcb assembly and advanced materials processing 
in addition  we produce custom thermal systems for a variety of specialty applications for a wide range of temperatures 
we derive our net sales from customers around the world 
our customers include large multinational oem original equipment manufacturers and ems electronic manufacturing service providers requiring advanced thermal processing equipment solutions 
in  net sales to our five largest customers accounted for of our total net sales 
our net sales in were dispersed worldwide  with approximately to customers in the united states  to asia pacific customers  to european customers and to other americas 
over the past three years  the percentage of our net sales to international customers was in  in and in critical accounting policies the following is a discussion of those accounting policies that the company deems to be critical that is  they are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and they reflect management s reliance on estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as updated by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
under these guidelines  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred or services rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and payment is reasonably assured 
under these requirements  when the terms of sale include customer acceptance provisions  and compliance with those provisions have not been previously demonstrated  revenues are recognized upon acceptance 
furthermore  revenues for products that require installation for which the installation is essential to functionality or is not deemed inconsequential or perfunctory are recognized upon completion of installation 
revenues for products sold where installation is not essential to functionality and is deemed inconsequential or perfunctory are recognized upon shipment with estimated installation and warranty costs accrued 
applying the requirements of sab no 
to future sales arrangements used in the company s equipment sales may result in the deferral of the revenue for some equipment sales 
the company also has certain sales transactions for products  which are not completed within the normal operating cycle of the business 
it is the company s policy to account for these transactions using the percentage of completion method for revenue recognition purposes when all of the following criteria exist 
the company has received the customer s purchase order or entered into a legally binding contract 
the customer is credit worthy and collection is probable or customer prepayments are required at product completion milestones or specific dates 
the sales value of the product to be delivered is significant in amount when compared to the company s other products 
product costs can be reasonably estimated  there is no major technological uncertainty and the total engineering  material procurement  product assembly and test cycle time extend over a period of six months or longer 
under the percentage of completion method  revenues and gross margins to date are recognized based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared to the latest estimate of total costs to complete the product as a percentage of the total contract revenue for the product 
revisions in costs and gross margin percentage estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts causing the revision become known 
provisions for total estimated losses on uncompleted contracts  if any  are made in the period in which such losses are determined 

table of contents inventory valuation the company s inventories consist of material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
the company determines the cost of inventory based on the first in  first out method fifo 
the company regularly reviews the quantity of inventories on hand and compares these quantities to the expected usage of each applicable product or product line 
the company s inventories are adjusted in value to the lower of costs and or net realizable value 
since the value of the company s inventories depends in part on the company s estimates of each product s net realizable value  adjustments may be needed to reflect changes in valuation 
any adjustments the company is required to make to lower the value of the inventories are recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
for more information on the company s inventory valuation  please see note to the financial statements included in this report 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales of certain items in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated

the company has a secured revolving loan agreement with a us bank that allows for aggregate borrowings  including letters of credit  up to a maximum of million against a borrowing base of secured accounts receivable and inventory 
the company may elect to borrow at interest rates of either the prime rate or a rate pegged to the libor rate in effect from time to time 
this loan agreement extends to may  and is subject to maintaining certain financial covenants 
at december  borrowings outstanding under this agreement were million and the borrowing base formula permitted aggregate borrowings of approximately million 
as a result of a decrease in tangible net worth following the write off of the million restructuring charge at the end of the third quarter of and an increase in borrowings  the company was out of compliance with its total liabilities to tangible net worth covenant under the loan agreement at october  the company was in compliance with all financial covenants at december  and the company has provided the bank with forecasted financial statements that show the company is projecting to be in compliance with all financial covenants for all of although the non compliance at the end of the third quarter has not been waived  the bank has continued to lend funds to the company under the terms of the existing loan agreement

upon meeting certain profitability goals for  the maximum lending would return to million  the existing availability based on inventories would be reinstated  and the interest rate on borrowings would return to the prime rate 
in addition  the bank requested that the company use its best efforts to obtain for the bank a second mortgage on the company s headquarters building and provide the bank with a negative pledge that would prevent any other party from obtaining a second mortgage on the property if the second mortgage could not be obtained 
the company is actively discussing the proposed changes to the loan agreement with the bank  and believes it will conclude its discussions with the bank on terms that are acceptable to both parties 
based on its forecasted business plan  the borrowing base changes and other reductions in availability proposed by the bank would provide sufficient credit for the company s anticipated working capital needs for all of as discussed under risk factors  the company will need continued access to working capital to fund its operations

the company s business forecasts project that our cash position  cash flow and our working capital line of credit will be sufficient to meet our corporate  operating and capital requirements throughout contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations at december  were payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands long term debt capital leases operating leases open purchase orders other long term liabilities total other matters the impact of inflation and the effect of foreign exchange rate changes during have not had a material impact on our business and financial results 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission  are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
we are subject to cyclical downturns in the electronics and semiconductor industry our business depends predominantly on the capital expenditures of electronics and semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn depend on current and anticipated market demand for printed circuit board and integrated circuits and the products that use them 
the electronics and semiconductor industry has historically been very cyclical and has experienced periodic downturns that have had a material adverse effect on the demand for electronic and semiconductor processing equipment  including equipment that we manufacture and market 
the rate of changes in demand is accelerating  rendering the global electronic and semiconductor industry increasingly volatile 
during periods of reduced and declining demand  we must be able to quickly and effectively align our costs with prevailing market conditions  as well as motivate and retain key employees 
in particular  our inventory levels during periods of reduced demand have at times been higher than optimal  relative to the current levels of production demand 
we cannot provide any assurance that we may not be required to make inventory valuation adjustments in future periods 
during periods of rapid growth  we must be able to acquire and or develop sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand  and hire and assimilate a sufficient number of qualified people 
our business may be adversely affected if we fail to respond to rapidly changing industry cycles in a timely and effective manner 

table of contents we have shifted a substantial portion of our production capacity to a new and expanding manufacturing facility in shanghai  china in the company began manufacturing operations in a new leased facility in shanghai  china 
the volume and variety of the company s products produced in china is expected to continue to increase throughout the successful operation of our china facility is important to restoring our business to profitability and allowing us to remain competitive 
we need to address successfully  the transitional leadership  management  technical and administrative organization requirements of doing business in china 
if we are not successful in managing our china operation  our business and profitability will be adversely affected 
in addition  during  the company plans to begin the construction of an additional building  which will be leased  and we will need to execute this expansion successfully to realize the benefit of our china operations in and beyond 
some of the requirements of sarbanes oxley affect us as a small company disproportionately and we may not be able to comply despite great effort and expense the sarbanes oxley act of imposed many new requirements on public companies  the most significant of which involves the documentation  testing and auditing of our internal control over financial reporting 
although we are not required to be in compliance until our annual report for the year ended december  we must begin now to document and test our internal controls in a way that we have never before been required to do as a small company 
we expect this effort will involve substantial time and expense  and we cannot be sure that we will be able to complete the task or that our internal controls will meet the standards that are currently required 
if we fail to comply with these requirements involving internal controls  investor confidence in our company might suffer  which could result in a decline in our stock price 
if we do not have access to additional credit  we may not be able to take advantage of a significant growth in the markets that we serve the electronics market that we serve may have a significantly higher growth 
we need access to credit to take advantage of a higher growth rate and allow us to meet the demand for our products 
as a result of our non compliance with a bank covenant at the end of the third quarter of  and as a condition to waiving that non compliance our bank has proposed additional restrictions on our ability to borrow 
although we believe this proposal provides us with a sufficient amount of credit we need for our forecasted business plan  it may not be sufficient to allow us to take full advantage of significantly higher increases in orders for our products 
in addition  if we do not continue to comply with our bank covenants  we may not be able to borrow and our business would be adversely affected 
our primary computer business system is out dated 
a significant malfunction could disrupt the activities of the company the company s manufacturing business system is at end of life  potentially posing a risk to the operation of the business 
some of the computer system hardware and software have limited support  which could result in an interruption in business activities 
solutions to address these risks are being developed 
recent accounting developments on april   the fasb issued financial accounting standards no

fas amends and clarifies the accounting guidance on derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities that fall within the scope of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
fas amends fas to reflect decisions that were made as part of the process undertaken by the derivatives implementation group dig  which necessitated amending fas  in connection with 
table of contents other projects dealing with financial instruments  and regarding implementation issues related to the application of the definition of a derivative 
fas also amends certain other existing pronouncements  which will result in more consistent reporting of contracts that are derivatives in their entirety or that contain embedded derivatives that warrant separate accounting 
fas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after september   with certain exceptions  and for hedging relationships designated after june  the guidance is to be applied prospectively 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r was issued in december sfas r replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires companies to recognize the compensation cost related to share based payment transactions with employees in the financial statements 
the compensation cost is measured based upon the fair value of the instrument issued 
share based compensation transactions with employees covered within sfas r include stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee stock purchase plans 
sfas included a fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees  but allowed companies to continue to apply the guidance in apb provided that they disclose in the footnotes to the financial statements the pro forma net income if the fair value based method been applied 
the company currently uses the fair value based method for recognition of compensation expense under sfas sfas r requires the use of the modified prospective application transition method 
the modified prospective application transition method requires the application of this standard to all new awards issued after the effective date  all modifications  repurchased or cancellations of existing awards after the effective date  and unvested awards at the effective date 
for unvested awards  the compensation cost related to the remaining requisite service that has not been rendered at the effective date will be determined by the compensation cost calculated currently for either recognition under sfas we will be adopting the modified prospective application of sfas r 
based on the current options outstanding  we do not anticipate the adoption of this statement to result in the recognition of material additional compensation cost in the year of adoption 
sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas was issued in november sfas reinforces that abnormal levels of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage are required to be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
the statement also requires fixed production overheads be allocated to conversion costs based on the production facility s normal capacity 
the provisions in statement are effective prospectively for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosure our primary market risk exposure is in the area of foreign currency exchange rate risk as we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations as they pertain to invoices for parts and labor in our foreign service locations 
as of december   all of our long term debt and capital lease obligations are fixed rate financial instruments 
therefore we are not exposed to interest rate risk resulting from variable interest rate of our debt
