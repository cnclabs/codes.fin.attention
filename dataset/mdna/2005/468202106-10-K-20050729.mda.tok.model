the fixed fees that we earn from the financial institutions originate from a fee typically paid by the customer to the financial institution upon approval and funding of the respective financial products 
we earn a portion of this fee depending upon the product facilitated  with the fees that we earn varying in amounts up to per product 
these financial products are offered pursuant to our contractual arrangements with financial institutions

if the amount of uncollected loans exceeds the net finance fees received by sbb t  then we have agreed to reimburse sbb t in an amount equal to of such difference 
the greater of an additional fee of for each ral facilitated by our network in or a portion of rals collected in that were originated prior to beginning in  this additional fee of will be subject to a threshold by which net finance fees received by sbb t must exceed uncollected loans by an amount ranging from to of the aggregate principal amount of rals facilitated by our network 
revenues will be recognized when  and if  this threshold is exceeded 
a variable fee equal to of the amount by which the net finance fees received by sbb t exceeds uncollected loans by a threshold amount of at least of the aggregate principal amount of rals facilitated by our network 
no such revenues were recognized in fiscal revenues will be recognized in fiscal when  and if  this threshold is exceeded 
we will continue to receive a portion of the collections with respect to rals facilitated by sbb t in prior years  although we expect such amounts from prior year loans facilitated by sbb t to diminish 
sbb t in fiscal and and household in  and other financial product revenues represent revenues we earned equal to a portion ranging from to of the difference between finance fees paid by customers to the financial institutions and loan amounts that the financial institutions are unable to collect 
these revenues were in addition to the fixed fees recorded in financial product fees earned from the facilitation of rals 
the finance fee was calculated as a percentage of the total loan amount subject to a minimum and maximum fee 
the finance fees were maintained by the financial institutions as a reserve against uncollected loans 
other financial product revenues were recognized only to the extent that the reserves maintained by the lending financial institutions exceeded the uncollected loans made by these financial institutions at the end of each reporting period 
other revenues other revenues include ancillary fees we earn from franchisees  including a fee per tax return prepared paid by franchisees for the processing of each electronically transmitted tax return 
we recognize revenues from processing fees at the time the tax returns are filed 
approximately of all tax returns filed by our network are filed electronically

fiscal year ended april  as compared to the fiscal year ended april  total revenues total revenues increased million  or  primarily due to the increase of in the number of tax returns prepared in our network as well as due to the increase of in the average revenues per tax return prepared in our network

same store sales growth of in fiscal was lower than the past two fiscal years driven primarily by a delayed start to the tax season that led to lower new customer growth 
the delay may have been caused by a delay in the receipt of form w s as consumers filed their tax returns with the irs later in the tax season 
the shortened filing period led to longer than expected wait times at some of our locations  which given the demands of the early season filer to file quickly  may have resulted in potential customers choosing other competitors 
prior year existing customers continued to choose our network at comparable rates with retention rates remaining just under 
the impact caused by the delay in the early season resulted in a lower average number of tax returns prepared by age of office 
to address this type of issue in the future  we are evaluating the growth opportunity within existing and new territories given such dynamic 
we are working with franchisees and our company owned office operations to better identify opportunities for investment to further expand the business and to improve the level of brand awareness 
furthermore  we have invested in additional tools and resources to improve the site selection process

the estimate is based on the pricing terms of the transitional agreement and historical volumes 
liquidity and capital resources historical sources and uses of cash from operations background prior to our ipo  funds that we generated from our operations were regularly transferred to cendant 
in addition  cendant funded expenses on our behalf 
as an independent public company  we now maintain our cash and cash equivalents  fund our operations and enter into investing and financing activities independently 
with respect to financing activities  cendant historically received the benefit of our operating cash flow and funded our operations following the end of the tax season 
consequently  until the completion of our ipo in june  our financing activities had consisted solely of the settlement of intercompany transactions with cendant 
seasonality of cash flows our revenues have been and are expected to continue to be highly seasonal 
as a result  we generate most of our operating funds during the tax season that consists of the period from january through april 
certain of our expenses are also highly seasonal in nature including our marketing and advertising expenses as well as the costs to operate our company owned offices  both of which increase shortly before and continue through the tax filing season 
during the off peak season  we require funds to cover our operating expenses as well as to reinvest in our business for future growth

we repaid in full million that was outstanding under our million credit facility with proceeds from our million credit facility and then terminated the million credit facility 
borrowings under the million credit facility are to be used to finance working capital needs  potential acquisitions and other general corporate purposes including repurchases of our common stock

eurodollar borrowings bear interest at the libor  as defined in the million credit facility  plus a credit spread as defined in the million credit facility  currently per annum 
base rate borrowings bear interest primarily at the prime rate  as defined in the agreement 
we may also use the million credit facility to issue letters of credit for general corporate purposes 
the million credit facility carries an annual unused fee currently at of the total commitment amount of million  which is payable quarterly 
the million credit facility agreement contains covenants  including the requirement that we maintain certain financial covenants  such as a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of to and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of to the consolidated leverage ratio is the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda  each as defined in the million credit facility 
the consolidated interest coverage ratio is the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense

events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and  as such  they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our consolidated financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
the following accounting policy may affect reported results resulting in variations in our financial results both on an interim and fiscal year end basis 
goodwill we have reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill as required by sfas no 
 by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair value and determined that the carrying amount of our reporting units did not exceed their respective fair value in fiscal when determining fair value  we utilized various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the respective carrying amount 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge  which would impact earnings 
we will continue to review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
an adverse change to our business will impact our consolidated results and may result in an impairment of our goodwill
