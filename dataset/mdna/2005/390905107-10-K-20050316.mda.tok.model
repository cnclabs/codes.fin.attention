critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected default probabilities  loss once loans default  expected commitment usage  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  value of collateral  estimated losses  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 

next page additional discussion of the allowance for loan losses is included in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december   under the section titled item business allowances for losses on loans and foreclosed assets 
judgments and assumptions used by management in the past have resulted in an overall allowance for loan losses that has been sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses 
inherent in this process is the evaluation of individual significant credit relationships 
from time to time certain credit relationships may deteriorate due to payment performance  cash flow of the borrower  value of collateral  or other factors 
in these instances  management may have to revise its loss estimates and assumptions for these specific credits due to changing circumstances 
in some cases  additional losses may be realized  in other instances  the factors that led to the deterioration may improve or the credit may be refinanced elsewhere and allocated allowances may be released from the particular credit 
for the periods included in these financial statements  management s overall methodology for evaluating the allowance for loan losses has not changed significantly 
stock split all share and per share amounts have been adjusted for the two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend declared in may general the profitability of the company and  more specifically  the profitability of its primary subsidiary  great southern bank the bank  depends primarily on its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income it earns on its loans and investment portfolio  and the interest it pays on interest bearing liabilities  which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
in  great southern was able to generate significant loan growth and thereby generate additional interest income 
as loan demand is affected by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  we cannot be assured that our loan growth will continue at its current pace 
if economic conditions improve in future periods  we believe that we are well positioned to capture loan market share in our southwest missouri market as well as our loan production markets of st 
louis  kansas city and northwest arkansas 
in addition  we may consider other markets in which to establish loan production offices 
we expect that the majority of our loan portfolio growth will continue to be in the commercial real estate and residential and commercial construction categories 
in the year ended december   commercial real estate loan balances increased million and construction loan balances increased million 
a portion of this loan growth was funded by attracting deposit accounts from our retail branch network  correspondent banking and corporate services customers 
the company then utilized these funding sources to meet loan demand from existing and new customers 
in the year ended december   total deposit balances increased million 
of this total increase  brokered certificate balances increased million and customer checking accounts increased million  while retail certificates decreased million 
as the generation of increased net interest income is critical to the growth of great southern s earnings  the continued ability to attract deposits or to fund loan growth through other funding sources is very important to our success 
there is a high level of competition for deposits in our markets 
we have been successful in attracting deposits in while it is our goal to continue to aggressively gain deposit market share in our branch footprint  we cannot be assured of this in future periods 

next page our ability to fund growth in future periods may also be dependent on our ability to continue to access brokered deposits and federal home loan bank advances 
in times when our loan demand has outpaced our generation of new deposits  we have utilized brokered deposits and federal home loan bank advances to fund these loans 
in the year ended december   fhlbank advances balances increased million 
this type of funding has been attractive to us because we can create variable rate funding which more closely matches the variable rate nature of much of our loan portfolio 
while we do not currently anticipate that our ability to access these funding sources will be reduced or eliminated in future periods  if this should happen  the limitation on our ability to fund additional loans would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
finally  our net interest income may be affected positively or negatively by market interest rate changes 
a large portion of our loan portfolio is tied to the prime rate and adjusts immediately when this rate adjusts 
we also have a large portion of our liabilities that will reprice with changes to the federal funds rate or the three month libor rate 
we monitor our sensitivity to interest rate changes on an ongoing basis see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of its non interest income and operating expenses 
non interest income consists primarily of gains on sales of loans and available for sale investments  service charges and atm fees  commissions earned by non bank subsidiaries and other general operating income 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy related expenses  postage  insurance  advertising  office expenses and other general operating expenses 
in  non interest income increased primarily due to increases in service charges and overdraft fees and increases in commission revenues earned by the company s travel  insurance and investment divisions 
this was partially offset by significantly lower net gains on loan sales in compared to we expect that the gains on loan sales will be similar in to those recorded in as market interest rates likely will be higher in  which will continue to reduce home loan refinancing activity 
fees from service charges and overdrafts will likely remain fairly flat in compared to as we expect that checking account growth will slow in we expect to continue to add checking balances  however  much of this growth is expected to come from additional corporate and correspondent banking relationships which typically do not generate as much fee income as smaller individual checking accounts 
the level of commission revenue is likely to remain at or slightly above levels in  assuming no substantial shocks occur in the financial markets or the travel industry 
in  operating expenses increased primarily in the categories of salaries and benefits and occupancy expense 
we anticipate that increases will occur again in  at a bit more moderate level  with regard to employee costs and occupancy expenses as we continue to add new branches in southwest missouri to serve new and existing customers and support growth in lending and operational areas 
in  we expect to add one to three new branch locations 
in addition  we have opened a loan production office in st 
louis to serve new and existing customers in that metropolitan area 
we anticipate that lending opportunities will continue to increase in our existing loan production offices in kansas city and northwest arkansas and will increase staffing as needed in these offices to meet demand for commercial and residential loans 
the operations of the bank  and banking institutions in general  are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and related monetary and fiscal policies of regulatory agencies 
deposit flows and the cost of deposits and borrowings are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for financing real estate and other types of loans  which in turn are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting loan demand and the availability of funds 

next page ongoing changes in the level and shape of the interest rate yield curve pose challenges for interest rate risk management 
beginning in  market interest rates were in a downward trend  settling at historically low levels from late through early during this period  great southern was able to effectively manage its interest rate risk and maintain its net interest margin at fairly stable levels 
in the second half of  the board of governors of the federal reserve system the frb began to increase short term interest rates through steady increases to the federal funds rate 
other short term rates  such as libor and short term u 
s 
treasury rates  began to increase in conjunction with these increases by the frb 
by the end of  the frb had raised the federal funds rates by and other short term rates rose by corresponding amounts 
however  there was not a parallel shift in the yield curve  intermediate and long term interest rates did not increase at a corresponding pace 
in some cases  these rates actually declined 
this caused the shape of the interest rate yield curve to become much flatter  which creates different issues for interest rate risk management 
in addition during this period  great southern s net interest margin was affected by certain characteristics of some of its loans  deposit mix  loan and deposit pricing by competitors  and timing of interest rate increases by the frb as compared to interest rate increases in the financial markets 
the effect of these factors began to be seen in the fourth quarter of in the form of net interest margin compression of approximately seven to ten basis points 
in addition  the company s interest rate spread at december   was much narrower than during most of the fourth quarter 
this margin compression is expected to continue  and may increase during the first half of generally  the flattening interest rate yield curve has hurt great southern s ability to reinvest proceeds from loan and investment repayments at higher rates 
the company s cost of funds has increased faster than its yield on loans and investments in part because of aggressive pricing of deposits by competitors in local markets 
great southern has increased rates on checking  money market and retail certificate accounts in order to remain competitive  while not leading the market 
great southern s deposit mix has also led to more rapidly increasing interest rates 
the company has significant balances in high dollar money market and premium now accounts  the owners of which are very rate sensitive and compare these products to other bank and non bank products available by competing financial services companies 
in addition  nearly all of great southern s brokered certificates of deposit are subject to interest rate swaps which create variable rate funding based on three month libor 
as the market anticipates rate increases by the frb  libor rates tend to increase ahead of the frb federal funds rate increases 
the portion of the company s loan portfolio which is tied to the prime rate of interest only increases when the frb actually increases the federal funds rate 
margin compression has also occurred in the company s investment securities portfolio 
the company has added securities in and to pledge as collateral to secure public funds deposits and customer reverse repurchase agreements 
the interest rates paid to these customers has increased consistent with short term market interest rate increases  while the overall yield on the investment portfolio has not increased from december  to december  in and the first half of  the company earned a greater spread on these securities due to the very low rate environment and the then steeper interest rate yield curve 
as borrowing costs have increased  the spread earned on these securities has decreased 
the company has also been repositioning its investment portfolio to shorten the time its securities will reprice  resulting in lower interest rate yields currently 
at december   the company also had a portfolio of prime based loans totaling approximately million which had interest rate floors 
these floors were at varying rates 
during and  most of these loan rate floors went into effect and established a loan rate which was higher than the contractual rate would have otherwise been 
this led to a loan portfolio yield which was approximately basis points higher than the prime rate of interest at december  as interest rates rose in the second half of  these interest rate floors were exceeded and the loans reverted back to their normal contractual interest rate terms 
at december   the loan portfolio yield was approximately basis points higher than the prime rate of interest  resulting in lower interest rate margins 

next page effect of federal laws and regulations federal legislation and regulation significantly affect the banking operations of the company and the bank  and have increased competition among commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking enterprises and other financial institutions 
in particular  the capital requirements and operations of regulated depository institutions such as the company and the bank have been and will be subject to changes in applicable statutes and regulations from time to time  which changes could  under certain circumstances  adversely affect the company or the bank 
potential impact of accounting principles to be implemented in the future in  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 application of accounting principles to loan commitment sab  which addresses the accounting treatment for loan commitments accounted for as derivative instruments 
sab permits recognition of servicing assets only when the servicing asset has been contractually separated from the underlying loan by sale or securitization 
sab is effective for mortgage loan commitments that are accounted for as derivatives and are entered into after march  the adoption of sab had no impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in  the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which requires the consolidation of certain special purpose entities spe s by a company if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the spe s operating activities 
one financial liability of the company that is impacted by fin is the company s trust preferred securities and related debentures 
through december   the trust preferred securities were presented in the company s financial statements as a liability and not a component of equity for financial reporting purposes 
in addition  the federal reserve board has allowed these securities to be included as tier i capital for purposes of regulatory capital calculations 
the fasb issued a revised interpretation of fin  which was required to be applied to certain variable instruments by march  this revised interpretation required the company to deconsolidate the trust for financial reporting purposes and to instead report as a liability the junior subordinated debentures of the company owned by the trust 
this change did not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
as a result of the issuance of the revised interpretation  the federal reserve board adopted a rule relating to the qualification of trust preferred securities as tier i capital 
under the rule  all of the company s subordinated debentures issued to capital trust continue to qualify as tier i capital 
the emerging issues task force eitf of fasb previously issued eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf issue provides guidance on the meaning of the phrase other than temporary impairment and its application to several types of investments  including debt securities classified as held to maturity and available for sale under fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
eitf issue attempts to better define whether impairment losses should be recognized on available for sale securities prior to sale of the securities 
it provides guidance for evaluating whether and when unrealized losses should be deemed other than temporary  requiring immediate recognition of those losses through earnings 
in addition  eitf requires financial statement disclosure for impaired securities on which an impairment loss has not been recognized  including the amount of unrealized loss and the term of that impairment 
certain portions of eitf have been delayed in order for the fasb staff to provide implementation guidance and clarify several issues that were raised by interested parties during the public comment period 
the company is monitoring developments related to this eitf issue 

next page in december  the fasb issued a revision to fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r  supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r established standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  including transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of the equity instruments 
the impact to the company of sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions in this case primarily stock options 
the company currently accounts for its stock based compensation using the intrinsic method as defined in apb and  accordingly  has not recognized any expense for stock option plans in the consolidated financial statements see note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s accounting for stock based compensation 
implementation of sfas r is required for the company beginning in the interim period ending september  the company is currently analyzing this new pronouncement to determine the impact on its financial statements 
as a result of sfas r  the company may adopt different models than are currently utilized to calculate the expense effect associated with the company s stock options 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value provisions of sfas comparison of financial condition at december  and december  during the year ended december   the company increased total assets by million to billion 
net loans increased by million 
the main loan areas experiencing increases were commercial real estate  commercial construction  multi family residential  single family residential and consumer 
the company s strategy continues to be focused on growing the loan portfolio  while maintaining credit risk and interest rate risk at appropriate levels 
for many years  the company has developed a niche in commercial real estate and construction lending in southwest missouri 
great southern s strategy is to continue to build on this competency in southwest missouri and in other geographic areas through the company s three loan production offices 
in addition  loan growth should continue as we strengthen existing relationships with loan customers who are expanding their operations in other areas 
available for sale investment securities increased by million  which was primarily an increase in mortgage backed securities and an increase in tax exempt securities issued by states and municipalities 
these securities were purchased to collateralize public funds deposits and customer repurchase agreements 
the company expects to continue to add available for sale securities as its overall assets increase 
while there is no specifically stated goal  the available for sale securities portfolio has recently been approximately to of total assets 
as market interest rates are generally expected to increase in  the company has focused on adding securities to the portfolio which should provide an adequate yield while holding their value reasonably well in a rising rate environment 
held to maturity investment securities decreased million primarily as the result of the repayment of one investment in an industrial development bond 
cash and cash equivalents increased million primarily due to larger cash letter settlements at december  foreclosed assets decreased million primarily due to the sale in of one significant real estate asset that was foreclosed in total liabilities increased million from billion at december  to billion at december  deposits increased million  fhlbank advances increased million and short term borrowings increased million 
the increase in short term borrowings was the result of increases in securities sold under repurchase agreements 
a number of great southern s corporate customers have expressed a desire to earn interest on their excess cash balances 
rather than move these balances to brokerages or other investment sources  the customers have chosen to place these funds with great southern in 
next page the form of repurchase agreements 
great southern is then able to earn a spread on these funds similar to a normal deposit 
additional fhlbank advances  from million at december   to million at december   were used to fund a portion of the loan portfolio growth 
retail certificates of deposit decreased million  to million 
total brokered deposits were million at december   up from million at december  the weighted average cost of these brokered deposits was approximately basis points higher than the retail certificate of deposit portfolio  excluding the effect of the company s interest rate swaps on a portion of these brokered certificates of deposit 
the interest rate swaps reduced the weighted average cost of the entire brokered certificate of deposit portfolio to a rate that is approximately basis points lower than the retail certificate of deposit portfolio 
most of the brokered certificate portfolio has a maturity date in excess of five years from the date of issue  with the company having the right to redeem the certificates semiannually after an initial period of usually one year or less 
these brokered certificates generally have a longer maturity than the company s retail certificates and therefore generally have a higher stated interest rate to the customer 
however  this rate paid to the customer is not the effective rate paid by the company  due to the company s interest rate swaps 
the effective cost to the company is the variable interest rate paid by the company to the interest rate swap counterparty 
this rate generally approximates the three month libor rate 
management continues to feel that fhlbank advances and brokered deposits are viable alternatives to retail deposits when factoring in all the costs associated with the generation and maintenance of additional retail deposits 
non interest bearing checking balances increased million 
checking and savings account balances totaled million at december   up from million at december  the company increased its relationships as a correspondent bank for several local financial institutions  which led to a portion of the increase in checking account balances 
at december   the company had approximately correspondent banking customers  primarily banks  thrifts  and credit unions in southwest missouri  with account balances totaling approximately million 
stockholders equity increased million from million at december  to million at december  net income for fiscal year was million  partially offset by a decrease of  in accumulated other comprehensive income  dividends declared of million and net repurchases of the company s common stock of  in  the company repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price of per share and issued  shares of stock at an average price of per share to cover stock option exercises 
in  the company was not aggressively buying back shares of its stock  choosing instead to utilize its capital to support growth in the loan portfolio 
management intends to continue to buy stock back from time to time as long as management believes that repurchasing the stock contributes to the overall growth of shareholder value 
the timing of repurchases  number of shares of stock that will be repurchased and the price that will be paid is the result of many factors  several of which are outside the control of the company 
the primary factors  however  are the number of shares available in the market from sellers at any given time  the price of the stock within the market as determined by the market  and the projected impact on the company s earnings per share 
results of operations and comparison for the years ended december  and general the increase in net income of million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of million  or  and an increase in non interest income of million  or  partially offset by an increase in non interest expense of million  or  and an increase in provision for income taxes of million  or 
next page total interest income total interest income increased million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase was due to a million  or  increase in interest income on loans and a million  or  increase in interest income on investments and other interest earning assets 
interest income for both loans and investment securities and other interest earning assets increased due to higher average balances  while interest income for both was negatively impacted by slightly lower average rates of interest 
interest income loans during the year ended december  compared to december   interest income on loans increased due to higher average balances  partially offset by lower average interest rates 
interest income increased million as the result of higher average loan balances from billion during the year ended december  to billion during the year ended december  the higher average balance resulted principally from the bank s increased commercial real estate and construction lending  multi family real estate lending and consumer lending 
through  the bank s one to four family residential loan portfolio had decreased since december   due to the origination of a greater dollar amount of fixed rate rather than adjustable rate loans 
the bank generally sells these fixed rate loans in the secondary market 
in  the bank s one to four family residential portfolio increased as more borrowers selected adjustable rate loans  which the bank retains 
in addition  loan refinancing slowed dramatically in interest income decreased million as the result of lower average interest rates 
the average yield on loans decreased from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  loan rates were generally low in both and  as a result of decreases in market rates of interest  primarily the prime rate of interest throughout through the first half of a large portion of the bank s loan portfolio adjusts with changes to the prime rate of interest 
in addition  as fixed rate commercial and consumer loans paid off during through  they would have generally been replaced with fixed or variable rate loans which carried a lower rate of interest 
interest income investments and other interest earning deposits interest income on investments and other interest earning assets increased mainly as a result of higher average balances during the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  interest income increased million as a result of an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  this increase was primarily in available for sale securities  where additional securities were acquired for liquidity and pledging to deposit accounts under repurchase agreements 
the increase in interest income was partially offset by  as a result of a decrease in average interest rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  in  as principal balances on higher rate fixed rate mortgage backed securities were paid down  the company replaced a large portion of these securities with variable rate mortgage backed securities primarily hybrid arms which had a lower yield relative to the fixed rate securities 
as market interest rates are generally expected to increase in  the company has focused on adding securities to the portfolio which should provide an adequate yield while holding their value reasonably well in a rising rate environment 
in addition  the company also increased its portfolio of tax exempt securities issued by states and municipalities by approximately million during these securities generally have coupon yields which are comparable to the variable rate mortgage backed securities which the company purchased  however  the tax equivalent yield is higher

interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust increased slightly due to increases in average rates from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  the average rate on these subordinated debentures is likely to increase significantly in as these liabilities are subject to an interest rate swap that requires the company to pay a variable rate of interest that is indexed to libor 
libor rates are expected to be higher in than in net interest income the company s overall interest rate spread decreased basis points  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the decrease was due to a basis point decrease in the weighted average yield received on interest earning assets  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities

provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses remained unchanged at million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the allowance for loan losses increased million  or  at december  compared to december  management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank 
the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions  regular reviews by internal staff and regulatory examinations 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio 
management has established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a 
next page watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectibility of the portfolio 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 
the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio at this time  based on current economic conditions 
if economic conditions deteriorate significantly  it is possible that additional assets would be classified as non performing  and accordingly  an additional provision for losses would be required  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition

at december   non performing assets were at relatively low levels 
non performing loans 
non performing loans decreased primarily as a result of the repayment of the remaining balance of the largest non performing relationship  as well as principal payments on other non performing relationships

these loans and securities are not reflected in the non performing assets 
during the year ended december   potential problem loans experienced increases primarily due to the addition of four large unrelated relationships to the potential problem loan category 
the first relationship totals million and is secured primarily by an office building  vacant land  developed and undeveloped residential subdivisions  and single family houses used as rental property in the branson  missouri  area 
the second relationship totals million and is secured primarily by a motel under construction in the state of illinois 
the third relationship totals million and is secured primarily by several single family houses under construction in northwest arkansas 
the fourth relationship totals million and is secured primarily by several single family houses used as rental property in springfield  missouri 
in addition  during the year ended december   one relationship which includes both held to maturity securities and loans was added to potential problem assets 
this relationship was underwritten by the company s lending department in the normal course of business  however  due to the nature of one of the assets revenue bonds this portion is carried as held to maturity securities 
this relationship totals million million is included in held to maturity securities with the remainder classified as loans and is secured primarily by two nursing homes in missouri 
one of the nursing homes has experienced cash flow problems recently 
the borrower maintains reserve funds to cover debt service shortfalls and required payments are current at december  these increases were partially offset by the removal of three unrelated relationships from potential problem loan status 
the first relationship totaled million and was secured primarily by commercial real estate  equipment and inventory in springfield  missouri 
the second relationship totaled million and was secured primarily by a motel in springfield  missouri 
the third relationship totaled million and was secured primarily by a motel in branson  missouri 
at december   the significant relationships described above accounted for million of the potential problem loan total 
non interest income total non interest income increased million  or  in the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to i an increase in service charges and atm fees of million  or  ii an increase in commissions revenue in the company s investment  travel and insurance divisions of million  or  and iii smaller increases and decreases in loan and commitment fees  late and prepayment charges on loans  loan servicing income  and merchant card fees 
the increase in service charge fees resulted from a larger number of accounts  higher levels of insufficient funds transactions by customers  and slight increases in fees for insufficient funds checks 
the increase in atm fees was related to a change during by the company to process its transactions in house and increases in overall usage by customers and non customers 
increases in commission revenues occurred in the travel and investments divisions 
in the latter half of  the company acquired two travel agencies in the springfield  missouri market 
these two additions  along with organic growth in our existing travel operations  have led to increased revenue in both the leisure and corporate travel areas 
in late  we began to implement some strategic sales initiatives in our investment division and throughout our branch network 
increased sales of a variety of investment products were realized during as a result of these initiatives 
additionally in  the company realized a gain of  on the sale of land which had been previously purchased for a branch location 
after completion of the branch  most of the remaining land was sold 
the increases described above were partially offset by i a decrease in net realized gains on sales of fixed rate residential and student loans of million  or  and ii a net realized loss on sales of available for sale securities in of  versus a net realized gain of  in during  the bank sold fewer residential loans than in during  lower interest rates were conducive to the generation of fixed rate mortgages  which the bank typically sells  rather than adjustable rate mortgages  which 
next page the bank typically retains in its portfolio 
in addition  unusually high levels of refinancing activity occurred in the decrease in gain on sale of securities was primarily due to the sale in of the company s holdings of the trust preferred securities of another publicly traded company  with no such similar sale in  and sales of other debt securities for net gains 
in  the company sold approximately million of available for sale securities at a loss to reposition some of its portfolio in anticipation of rising interest rates 
the company primarily sold low yielding agency callable securities and fixed rate mortgage backed securities and purchased variable rate mortgage backed securities and municipal securities  which should provide higher yields in future periods 
non interest expense total non interest expense increased million  or  in the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to i an increase of million  or  in salaries and employee benefits primarily due to the hiring of additional experienced personnel to fill commercial lending  loan administration  and branch supervisory positions  increased incentives paid to investment and travel personnel due to increased commission revenue generated  the opening during of two loan production offices and the hiring of additional personnel in these offices in  increased costs for health insurance and pension benefits  and normal merit increases for existing employees  ii an increase in net occupancy and equipment expense of  or  primarily due to increases in rent and depreciation on new offices and equipment and various maintenance projects on buildings and equipment  including required upgrades to the company s atms  and iii smaller increases and decreases in other non interest expense areas  such as postage  advertising  insurance  legal and professional fees  and bank charges and fees related to additional correspondent relationships 
the increases described above were partially offset by a decrease in expense on foreclosed assets of million in the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  in  the company experienced a  loss on the disposition of one foreclosed asset  a  write down of the carrying value of another unrelated foreclosed asset  and other expenses of maintaining various foreclosed assets 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income decreased slightly from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to higher balances of tax exempt investment securities and loans

the bank s one to four family residential loan portfolio decreased from december  to december   due to the origination of a greater dollar amount of fixed rate rather than adjustable rate loans 
the bank generally sells these fixed rate loans in the secondary market

interest expense fhlbank advances  short term borrowings and trust preferred securities interest expense on fhlbank advances  short term borrowings and trust preferred securities decreased million due to a decrease in average rates from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  in addition  average balances decreased from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december   resulting in decreased interest expense of  the average balance decrease was offset by increases in deposits 
average interest rates decreased due to lower overall market rates during the company s use of fhlbank advances  short term borrowings and trust preferred securities that reprice frequently daily  monthly or quarterly contributed to the significant decrease in average rates of interest 
net interest income the company s overall interest rate spread increased basis points  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the increase was due to a basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average yield received on interest earning assets 
the company s overall net interest margin increased basis points  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  in comparing the two years  the yield on loans decreased basis points while the yield on investment securities and other interest earning assets decreased basis points 
the rate paid on deposits decreased basis points  while the rate paid on fhlbank advances and other borrowings decreased basis points 
the prime rate of interest averaged during the year ended december   compared to an average of during the year ended december  as a large percentage of the bank s loans are tied to prime  this decrease was the primary reason for the decrease in the weighted average yield received on loans 
the decrease in the weighted average yield received on investment securities primarily resulted from maturities of higher yielding securities with the proceeds being reinvested at lower market yields and the increased amortization of premiums paid on the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio due to higher levels of prepayments on the underlying mortgages 
interest rates paid on deposits  fhlbank advances and other borrowings decreased significantly during compared to as certificates of deposit matured and were renewed or replaced  in most cases the new interest rate on these deposits was significantly lower than the previous rate 
in addition  the company continued to utilize interest rate swaps and fhlbank advances which repriced frequently to further reduce interest expense

the allowance for loan losses decreased  or  at december  compared to december  management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank 
the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions  regular reviews by internal staff and regulatory examinations 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio 
management has established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectibility of the portfolio 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 
the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio at this time  based on current economic conditions 
if economic conditions deteriorate significantly  it is possible that additional assets would be classified as non performing  and accordingly  additional provision for losses would be required  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition

statements of cash flows 
during the years ended december   and  the company had positive cash flows from operating activities and positive cash flows from financing activities 
the company experienced negative cash flows from investing activities during each of these same time periods 
cash flows from operating activities for the periods covered by the statements of cash flows have been primarily related to changes in accrued and deferred assets  credits and other liabilities  the provision for loan losses  depreciation  and the amortization of deferred loan origination fees and discounts premiums on loans and investments  all of which are non cash or non operating adjustments to operating cash flows 
net income adjusted for non cash and non operating items and the origination and sale of loans held for sale were the primary sources of cash flows from operating activities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management and market risk a principal operating objective of the company is to produce stable earnings by achieving a favorable interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
the company has sought to reduce its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by attempting to achieve a closer match between the periods in which its interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets can be expected to reprice through the origination of adjustable rate mortgages and loans with shorter terms to maturity and the purchase of other shorter term interest earning assets 
since the company uses laddered brokered deposits and fhlbank advances to fund a portion of its loan growth  the company s assets tend to reprice more quickly than its liabilities 
our risk when interest rates change the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is great southern s most significant market risk 
how we measure the risk to us associated with interest rate changes in an attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor great southern s interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk we regularly analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest rate spread that can be sustained despite fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate repricing gap  provides an indication of the extent to which an institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing during the same period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets during the same period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap within shorter repricing periods would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter repricing periods would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  the opposite would be true 
as of december   great southern s internal interest rate risk models indicate a one year interest rate sensitivity gap that is slightly negative 
interest rate risk exposure estimates the sensitivity gap are not exact measures of an institution s actual interest rate risk 
they are only indicators of interest rate risk exposure produced in a simplified modeling environment designed to allow management to gauge the bank s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
they do not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the bank s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other factors beyond the bank s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and in different amounts and cause a change  which potentially could be material  in the bank s interest rate risk 

next page in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases and decreases in interest rates on great southern s results of operations  great southern has adopted asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of great southern s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
management recommends and the board of directors sets the asset and liability policies of great southern which are implemented by the asset and liability committee 
the asset and liability committee is chaired by the chief financial officer and is comprised of members of great southern s senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with great southern s business plan and board approved policies 
the asset and liability committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability committee meets on a monthly basis to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital positions and anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities 
at each meeting  the asset and liability committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review 
the chief financial officer or his designee is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at their monthly meetings 
in order to manage its assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  great southern has focused its strategies on originating adjustable rate loans  and managing its deposits and borrowings to establish stable relationships with both retail customers and wholesale funding sources 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  we may determine to increase our interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain or increase our net interest margin
