item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company s revenues are primarily derived from product sales and toll services in the polymers processing industry 
product sales entail the company purchasing resin primarily polyethylene and other raw materials which are further processed within the company s operating facilities 
the further processing of the material may involve size reduction services and or compounding services 
compounding services involve melt blending various resins and additives to produce a homogeneous material 
compounding services include the manufacture and sale of concentrates 
concentrates are polymers loaded with high levels of chemical and organic additives that are melt blended into base resins to give plastic films and other finished products desired physical properties 
after processing  the company sells the finished products to customers 
toll services involve both size reduction and compounding services whereby these services are performed on customer owned material 
the company s management structure and reportable segments are organized into five business segments defined as ico polymers north america  ico brazil  bayshore industrial  ico europe and ico courtenay australasia 
this organization is consistent with the way information is reviewed and decisions are made by executive management 
ico polymers north america  ico brazil  ico europe and ico courtenay australasia primarily produce competitively priced polymer powders for the rotational molding industry as well as other specialty markets for powdered polymers  including masterbatch and concentrate producers  users of polymer based metal coatings  and non woven textile markets 
masterbatches are concentrates that incorporate all additives a customer needs into a single package for a particular product manufacturing process  as opposed to requiring numerous packages 
additionally  these segments provide specialty size reduction services on a tolling basis 
tolling refers to processing customer owned material for a service fee 
the bayshore industrial segment designs and produces proprietary concentrates  masterbatches and specialty compounds  primarily for the plastic film industry  in north america and in selected export markets 
the company s ico europe segment includes operations in france  holland  italy  sweden facility closed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the uk the company s ico courtney australasia segment includes operations in australia  malaysia and new zealand 
cost of sales and services is primarily comprised of purchased raw materials resins and various additives  compensation and benefits to non administrative employees  electricity  repair and maintenance  occupancy costs and supplies 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits paid to the sales and marketing  executive management  information technology  accounting  legal  human resources and other administrative employees of the company  other sales and marketing expenses  communications costs  systems costs  insurance costs  consulting costs and legal and professional accounting fees 
dollars in thousands  except share and per share data demand for the company s products and services tends to be driven by overall economic factors and  particularly  consumer spending 
the trend of applicable resin prices also impacts customer demand 
as resin prices are falling  customers tend to reduce their inventories and  therefore  reduce their need for the company s products and services as customers choose to purchase resin upon demand rather than building large levels of inventory 
conversely  as resin prices are rising  customers often increase their inventories and accelerate their purchases of products and services from the company to help control their raw material costs 
additionally  demand for the company s products and services tends to be seasonal  with customer demand historically being weakest during the company s first fiscal quarter due to the holiday season and also due to property taxes levied in the us on customers inventories on january the company s fourth fiscal quarter also tends to be softer compared to the company s second and third fiscal quarters  in terms of customer demand  due to vacation periods in the company s european markets 
however  demand during the company s fourth fiscal quarter of was the strongest demand of all of fiscal year quarters in part due to rising resin prices 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the more significant areas requiring use of estimates relate to employee benefit liabilities  valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  workers compensation  inventory reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable and commitments and contingencies 
estimates surrounding employee benefit liabilities are related to the company maintaining a partially self insured medical plan in the united states with stop loss insurance coverage limiting the company s expense to per covered person per year 
estimates are required in evaluating the company s medical expense incurred  but not paid due to the timing difference between when an employee receives medical care and the time the claim is processed and paid by the company typically a two to three month timing difference 
the valuation of deferred tax assets is based upon estimates of future pretax income in determining the ability to realize the deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction 
estimates for workers compensation liabilities are due to the company being partially self insured in the united states with the exception of fiscal year with stop loss insurance coverage limiting the company s expense to per claim 
estimates are made for ultimate costs associated with open workers compensation claims as well as for claims not yet reported 
inventory reserves are estimated based upon the company s review of its inventory 
this review requires the company to estimate the fair market value of certain inventory that has become old or obsolete 
determining the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts involves estimating the collectibility of customer accounts receivable balances 
estimates surrounding commitments and contingencies are related primarily to litigation claims for which the company evaluates the circumstances surrounding the claims to determine how much expense  if any  the company should record 
actual results could differ from the estimates discussed above 
management believes that its estimates are reasonable 
revenue and related cost recognition the company s accounting policy regarding revenue recognition is to recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the company has received an order from a customer 
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered for product sales  revenue recognition occurs when title and risk of ownership have passed to the customer 
for service revenue  revenue recognition occurs upon the completion of service 
seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable sales prices are agreed with the customer before delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered 
collectibility is reasonably assured the company has a customer credit policy to ensure collectibility is reasonably assured 
dollars in thousands  except share and per share data revenues billed to customers related to shipping and handling are included in revenues while the associated shipping and handling costs to the company are included in cost of sales and services 
impairment of property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment review includes comparison of undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets with the associated assets carrying value 
if the carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value

income taxes the provision for income taxes includes federal  state  and foreign income taxes currently payable and deferred based on currently enacted tax laws 
deferred income taxes are provided for the tax consequences of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the company reduces deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance when  based on its estimates  it is more likely than not that a portion of those assets will not be realized in a future period

changes in the cost and availability of polymers could adversely affect the company 
polymers ie  resins are a key ingredient of the company s products  and changes in the cost and availability of resins generally produced by the major chemical companies are outside of the company s control 
if resin costs increase  whether because of higher oil and gas prices or because of unavailability  the company may be forced to increase the prices at which it sells its products to our customers 
an increase in our prices may result in a decrease in customer demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
additionally  higher resin prices will lead to higher working capital requirements which could result in higher debt and associated interest expense 
on the other hand  a perception that resin costs will be decreasing in the near future may  in the short term  result in a decrease in customer demand for our products as customers wait for lower resin prices to be reflected in the price of our products  which could also have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
dollars in thousands  except share and per share data changes in economic activity could adversely affect the company 
the company s business cycles are affected by changes in the level of economic activity in the various regions in which the company operates 
the company s business cycles are generally volatile and relatively unpredictable 
in addition  the company is affected by cycles in the petroleum and oil and gas industries 
the length of these business cycles are outside of the company s control  although they can have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s success is partly dependent upon the company s ability to develop superior proprietary technology  know how and trade secrets

in addition  there can be no assurance that such persons will not develop substantially equivalent or superior proprietary processes and technologies 
the availability to  or development by others of equivalent or superior information  processes or technologies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the failure to properly manage inventories could expose the company to material financial losses 
the company s product sales business  including the company s concentrate manufacturing operations requires the company to buy inventories of supplies and products and to manage the risk of ownership of commodity inventories having fluctuating market values 
the maintenance of excessive inventories in these businesses could expose the company to losses from drops in market prices for its products while maintenance of insufficient inventories may result in lost sales to the company 
international events may hurt the company s operations 
a majority of the company s current operations is conducted in international markets  particularly the company s ico europe  ico brazil  and ico courtenay australasian specialty polymers processing services business 
the company expects to continue to seek to expand its international operations  primarily through internal growth 
the company s international operations are subject to certain political  economic and other uncertainties normally associated with international operations  including among others  risks of government policies regarding private property  taxation policies  foreign exchange restrictions and currency fluctuations and other restrictions arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over areas in which the company conducts business that may limit or disrupt markets  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights  and  possibly  civil disturbance or other forms of conflict 
losses from the factors above could be material in those countries where the company now has or may in the future have a concentration of assets

the company sustained net losses of  and  for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
although the company incurred income during fiscal years  and  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to achieve profitability in the future 
due to the company s lack of asset diversification  adverse developments in its industry could materially adversely impact the company s operations 
the company relies exclusively on the revenues generated in the polymer processing industry 
due to its lack of asset diversification  an adverse development in this industry would likely have a significantly greater impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows than if it maintained more diverse assets 
the company s success depends on attracting and maintaining key personnel  the failure to do so could disrupt the company s business operations 
the company s success will depend upon our ability to retain and attract experienced management and other professional staff 
the company s results of operations depend to a large extent on the efforts  technical expertise and continued employment of such personnel and members of our management team 
if we are unable to attract such personnel or a significant number of our existing key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present role without adequate replacements  our business operations could be adversely affected 
dollars in thousands  except share and per share data the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act are burdensome  and our failure to comply with them could have a material adverse effect on the company s business

goodwill impairment could occur in the future 
if our goodwill becomes impaired the company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 
under generally accepted accounting principles  goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined 
the company is prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock or redeeming or repurchasing any of its common stock until dividends in arrears on the preferred stock are paid 
through september   the company owed an aggregated  of dividends in arrears to the holders of the preferred stock 
such undeclared or unpaid preferred stock dividends will need to be declared and paid before the company can pay a dividend on its common stock or redeem or repurchase any of its common stock 
payment of any dividends in arrears will depend on the financial condition  results of operations and capital requirements of the company  as well as other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors  and there can be no assurance that the board of directors will declare dividends on the preferred stock in the future 
the company may have additional tax liabilities 
the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 
based on the results of an audit or litigation  a material adverse effect on the company s income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
operational risks such as personal injury  property damages  pollution and environmental damages could adversely affect the company s business 
the operations of the company involve many risks  which  even through a combination of experience  knowledge and careful evaluation  may not be overcome 
these risks include equipment or product failures or work related accidents which could also result in personal injury  property damages  pollution and other environmental risks 
the company may not be fully insured against possible losses pursuant to such risks 
such losses could have a material adverse impact on the company

the company is subject to numerous and changing local  state  federal and foreign laws and regulations concerning the use  storage  treatment  disposal and general handling of hazardous materials  some of which may be considered to be hazardous wastes  and restricting releases of pollutants and contaminants into the environment 
these laws and regulations may require the company to obtain and maintain certain permits and other authorizations mandating procedures under which the company will operate and restricting emissions 
many of these laws and regulations provide for strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up contamination resulting from releases of regulated materials into the environment 
violations of mandatory procedures under operating permits may result in fines  remedial actions or  in more serious instances  shutdowns or revocation of permits or authorizations 
there can be no assurance that a review of the company s past  present or future operations by courts or federal  state  local or foreign regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  the revocation of any of the company s material operating permits  the denial of any material permit application or the failure to renew any material interim permit could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company cannot predict what environmental laws and regulations will be enacted or adopted in the future or how such future law or regulation will be administered or interpreted 
to date  the company has incurred compliance and clean up costs in connection with environmental laws and regulations and there can be no assurance as to future dollars in thousands  except share and per share data costs 
in particular  compliance with more stringent environmental laws and regulations  more vigorous enforcement policies  or stricter interpretations of current laws and regulations  or the occurrence of an industrial accident  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
competition in our industry is intense  and we are smaller and have a more limited operating history than some of our competitors 
the industry in which the company operates is highly competitive 
some competitors or potential competitors of the company have substantially greater financial or other resources than the company 
larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations or rising costs of raw materials more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
the inability of the company to effectively compete in its markets would have a material adverse effect on the company 
certain litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the company is party to various legal proceedings 
some of the claims made against the company are large in comparison to our working capital and liquidity  and the final resolution of such matters are uncertain  both with respect to timing and the amount of our loss  if any 
there can be no assurance that adverse results in such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company

the company s revenues and profitability are impacted by the change in resin prices 
the company uses various resins primarily polyethylene to make its products 
as the price of resin increases  market prices for the company s products will generally also increase 
this will typically lead to higher average selling prices and will impact the company s gross profit 
the impact of gross profit is due to a lag in matching the change in raw material cost of goods sold and the change in product sales prices
