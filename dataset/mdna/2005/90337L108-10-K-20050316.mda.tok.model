item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary our business 
we operate outpatient physical and or occupational therapy clinics that provide preventative and post operative care for a variety of orthopedic related disorders and sports related injuries  treatment for neurologically related injuries and rehabilitation of injured workers 
at december  we operated outpatient physical and occupational therapy clinics in states 
the average age of our clinics at december   was years 
we have developed of the clinics and acquired six 
to date  we have sold four clinics  closed facilities due to substandard performance  and consolidated four clinics with other existing clinics 
in  we added new clinics  closed and sold in addition to our owned clinics  we also manage physical therapy facilities for third parties  primarily physicians  with four third party facilities under management as of december  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position involving significant estimates requiring our judgment 
our critical accounting policies are revenue recognition 
we bill third party payors for services at standard rates 
net patient revenues are based on established billing rates  less allowances and discounts for patients covered by contractual programs 
payments received under these programs are based on predetermined rates and are generally less than the established billing rates of the clinics 
net patient revenues reflect reserves  evaluated monthly by management  for contractual and other adjustments agreed to or established with payors 
reimbursement for medicare beneficiaries is based upon a fee schedule published by hhs 
for a more complete description of our third party revenue sources  see business sources of revenue in item allowance for doubtful accounts 
we review the accounts receivable aging and rely on prior experiences with particular payors to determine an appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts 
historically  clinics that have large numbers of aged accounts generally have less favorable collection experience  and thus they require a higher allowance 
accounts that are ultimately determined to be uncollectible are written off against our bad debt allowance 
the amount of our aggregate bad debt allowance is regularly reviewed for adequacy in light of current and historical experience 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we must estimate our federal and state income tax liability  as well as assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as bad debt expense and amortization of leasehold improvements for tax and for accounting purposes 
the differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we periodically assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and if not  establish a valuation allowance 
carrying value of long lived assets 
our property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill collectively  our long lived assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets 
we account for our long lived assets pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
this accounting standard requires that we periodically  and upon the occurrence of certain events  assess the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if the carrying value of our property and equipment or intangible assets exceeds their undiscounted cash flows  we are required to write the carrying value down to estimated fair value 
also  if the carrying value of our goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value  we are required to allocate the estimated fair value to our assets and liabilities  as if we had just acquired it in a business combination 
we then write down the carrying value of our goodwill to the implied fair value 
any such write down is included as an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of net income 
judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our long lived assets 
we may use quoted market prices  prices for similar assets  present value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates 
in addition  we may obtain independent appraisals in certain circumstances 
we may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to apply these valuation techniques 
irrespective of our valuation analysis  future market conditions may deteriorate 
accordingly  any value ultimately derived from our long lived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value 
accounting for minority interests 
in the majority of our partnership agreements  the therapist partner begins with a profit interest in his or her clinic partnership  which increases by at the beginning of each subsequent year up to a maximum of 
within the balance sheet and statement of net income  we record partner therapists profit interest in the clinic partnerships as minority interest in earnings of subsidiary limited partnerships for those formed prior to january  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  issues related to the accounting for stock compensation under apb no 
and fasb interpretation no   which provides specific accounting guidance relating to various incentive compensation issues 
we reviewed eitf with respect to the partnership structure and the accounting for minority interests and concluded that for partnerships formed after january   eitf requires us to expense as compensation rather than as a minority interest in earnings  the clinic partners interest in profits 
moreover  eitf also requires  as to clinic partnerships formed after january   that we expense as compensation rather than capitalizing as goodwill  the purchase of minority interest in the partnerships 
at december   we operated clinics which had a minority interest 
in accordance with the above  for the years ended december   and  we have expensed   and  respectively  of the minority interests in earnings of subsidiary limited partnerships relating to certain partnerships formed after january   as salaries and related costs 
as of december   and    and  respectively  in undistributed minority interests related to those partnerships is classified as other long term liabilities 
this change in classification had no effect on net income at december   and but rather resulted in a reclassification from minority interests in earnings to salaries and related costs 
see minority interest a subsection of significant accounting policies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item selected operating and financial data the following table presents selected operating and financial data

approximately of the increase or million was attributable to the new clinics  million was attributable to various mature clinics due to escalating rent costs and million was attributable to lease expense as described in the next sentence 
in response to the february  letter from the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission to the american institute of certified public accountants  we undertook a comprehensive review of our accounting practices for leases 
as a result of this review  we made an accounting adjustment that resulted in an acceleration of rent expense under certain leases that contained rent abatements and or fixed escalations in rental payments 
we recorded a cumulative rent expense adjustment relating to this matter principally for the years to of approximately  pre tax in the fourth quarter of see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

closure costs in the third quarter  we recognized a loss of  related to the closure of eight clinics 
in the fourth quarter  we recognized a loss of  related to a closed clinic  which was offset by a  benefit resulting from our ability to reduce liabilities related to lease obligations on the eight clinic closures in the third quarter through renegotiation and early termination of certain leases

net income declined to million from million 
earnings per diluted share were for and for the year ended december  
total diluted shares at december  were million  a reduction of approximately  shares from million at december  primarily due to a decrease in the dilutive effect on stock options of approximately  shares  offset with an increase in the number of weighted average shares outstanding of approximately  shares

total patient visits increased  or  to million for from million for the growth in visits for the year was attributable to an increase of  visits in clinics opened between january  and december  and  visits from clinics developed during the new clinics  offset by a  decrease in visits for clinics opened before january  we believe the decrease in visits for clinics opened before january  was primarily a result of increases in patient co payments and deductibles which contributed to some softness in the therapy sector 
we also believe that in certain markets this decline was attributable to higher unemployment rates or increased competition levels 
net patient revenues from new clinics accounted for approximately of the increase  or approximately million 
the remaining increase of million in net patient revenues was from clinics opened prior to january  the mature clinics 
of the million increase  million related to clinics opened during  offset by a million decrease in clinics opened prior to january  in addition  of the million increase in net patient revenues from the mature clinics  million of this increase related to a increase in patient visits  while  was due to a less than increase in the average net revenue per visit

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased to million for from million for  a decrease of approximately million  or as a result of lower pre tax income 
during and  we accrued state and federal income taxes at an effective tax rate of 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that our business is generating enough cash flow from operating activities to allow us to meet our short term and long term cash requirements excluding possible acquisitions 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at december   an increase of 
although the start up costs associated with opening new clinics  and our planned capital expenditures are significant  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund the working capital needs of our operating subsidiaries  future clinic development and investments 
included in cash and cash equivalents at december  were million in a money market fund and million in a short term debt instrument issued by an agency of the us government 
the increase in cash of million from december  to december  is due primarily to million in cash provided by operating activities  offset by cash used in financing and investing activities of million and million  respectively 
in  we used million for distributions to minority investors in subsidiary limited partnerships  million to repurchase  shares of common stock of the company  million to purchase fixed assets and million for intangibles 
during  the exercise of stock options generated million in cash to the company and resulted in a related tax benefit of million 
our current ratio increased to to at december  from to at december  the increase in the current ratio is due primarily to the conversion of convertible subordinated notes into common stock of the company upon maturity and the increase in cash and cash equivalents 
we have future obligations for debt repayments and future minimum rentals under operating leases 
the obligations as of december  are summarized as follows in thousands contractual obligation total thereafter notes payable employee agreements     operating leases       total       in   of a convertible subordinated note was converted into  shares of common stock  leaving a million balance at december  and on january    of the convertible subordinated note was converted into  shares of common stock and  on june   the final remaining million balance was converted by the note holder into  shares of common stock 
we do not currently have a credit line or other credit arrangements 
historically  we have generated sufficient cash from operations to fund our development activities and cover operational needs 
we generally develop new clinics rather than acquire them which requires less capital 
we plan to continue developing new clinics and may also make acquisitions in select markets 
we have from time to time purchased the minority interests of limited partners in our clinic partnerships 
we may purchase additional minority interests in the future 
generally  any acquisition or purchase of minority interests are expected to be accomplished using a combination of cash  notes or common stock 
we believe that existing funds  supplemented by cash flows from existing operations  will be sufficient to meet our current operating needs  development plans and any purchases of minority interests through at least in september  the board of directors board authorized management to purchase  in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  up to  shares of our common stock 
on february  and on december   the board authorized share repurchase programs of up to  and  additional shares  respectively  of our outstanding common stock 
as of december   there were  shares that can be purchased under these programs 
as there is no expiration for the board authorizations  additional shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market or private transactions 
shares purchased are held as treasury shares and may be used for valid corporate purposes or retired as the board deems advisable 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased   and  shares  respectively  of our common stock on the open market for million   and million  respectively 
recently promulgated accounting pronouncements in may  fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas  was issued 
sfas establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments of both liabilities and equity 
sfas also includes disclosures for financial instruments within its scope 
for the company  sfas was effective for instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise was effective as of january   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments 
for certain redeemable financial instruments  sfas will be effective for us on january  the effective date has been deferred indefinitely for certain other types of mandatory instruments 
the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued revised interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  which requires the consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin r  as revised  was applicable to financial statements of companies that had interests in special purpose entities during effective as of the first quarter of  fin r is applicable to financial statements of companies that have interests in all other types of entities 
adoption of fin r had no effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp  which requires measures of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit costs to reflect the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp supersedes fsp and is effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after june  the adoption of fsp did not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued revised sfas  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
sfas r requires that the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual period that begins after june  for the company  sfas r is effective for our third quarter which begins july  sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective dated 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but this method also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with sfas we currently utilize black scholes  a standard option pricing model  to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a lattice model 
we have not yet determined the model we will use to measure the fair value of employee stock options upon the adoption of sfas r 
also  sfas r requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
the requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated  because they depend on  among other things  when and if employees exercise stock options 
however  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in the prior periods for the tax benefit from exercise of stock options  as shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows  were million for  million for and million for we currently expect to adopt sfas r effective july   however  we are evaluating our method of estimating the grant date fair value and which of the aforementioned adoption methods we will use 
based on stock options granted to its employees through december   we expect that the adoption of sfas r  would reduce both third quarter and fourth quarter net earnings by approximately  each 
previously  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 sfas which provides alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also amends certain disclosures under sfas and accounting principles board opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
sfas was effective for fiscal years ending after december  for  and  we continued to use the provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees to account for employee stock options and apply the disclosures required under sfas and sfas factors affecting future results clinic development as of december   we had clinics in operation  of which opened in we expect to incur initial operating losses from new clinics opened in  which will impact our operating results 
generally we experience losses during the initial period of a new clinic s operation 
operating margins for newly opened clinics tend to be lower than more seasoned clinics because of start up costs and lower patient visits and revenues 
patient visits and revenues gradually increase in the first year of operation  as patients and referral sources become aware of the new clinic 
revenues tend to increase significantly during the two to three years following the first anniversary of a clinic opening 
based on historical performance of our new clinics  generally the clinics opened in and late would favorably impact our results of operations beginning in convertible subordinated debt in may  we issued a million convertible subordinated note  series c  due june  the series c note 
the series c note was convertible at the option of the holder into shares of company common stock determined by dividing the principal amount of the note being converted by 
the series c note bore interest from the date of issuance at a rate of per annum  payable quarterly 
in june   of the series c note was converted by the note holder into  shares of common stock 
the principal amount under the series c note was million at december  on january    of the series c note was converted by the note holder into  shares of common stock 
on june   the final remaining balance of million of the series c note was converted by the note holder into  shares of common stock 
the series c note was unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to all other indebtedness for borrowed money incurred by the company
