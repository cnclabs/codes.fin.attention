item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
executive summary the company did not achieve its financial objectives in due to two primary factors  enrollments and costs 
enrollments decreased in compared to the company s leads inquiries for enrollment increased in compared to the company was unable to convert leads into enrollments at the same overall rate conversion rate as resulting in fewer enrollments for the company changed its advertising mix during spending a greater percentage of overall advertising dollars on internet advertising 
internet advertising represented of the total advertising dollars spent during compared to during leads from internet advertising had a lower conversion rate than other forms of advertising 
the company believes conversion rates for internet leads can be increased with additional training  however  the company believes internet leads will not have the same conversion rates as television and newspaper 
television leads were of the total leads in compared to in however  the dollars spent on television advertising were approximately the same for both years 
the company also has one program that received state board programmatic provisional accreditation extension due to pass rates at one campus 
the result of the probation was a reduction during of enrollments  as further discussed below 
the company believes that it has made appropriate changes to increase pass rates to an acceptable level in the future  however  there is no assurance that the state board will approve additional enrollments in the future 
higher expenses negatively impacted the company s performance 
payroll increased significantly as the company implemented new programs and added staff in advance of program implementation 
the company moved several locations which increased rent and depreciation expense significantly 
the company changed its management structure in the last quarter of to provide additional support and training to its campuses 
management believes this structure creates the framework that will allow the company to improve operational results of existing campuses through training and oversight and pursue future growth opportunities 
part ii p overview the company owns and operates proprietary  postsecondary institutions that offer career vocational training programs in the allied health field 
as of december   the company operated campuses at locations in seven states the campuses 
the company s revenue is derived almost entirely from tuition  textbook sales  fees and charges paid by  or on behalf of  our students 
a large number of the company s students paid a substantial portion of tuition and other fees with funds received through student assistance financial aid programs under title iv of the higher education act of  as amended the hea 
the company received approximately of cash revenue from such funds for the year ended december  the company s strategy over the next two years is to grow revenue primarily by increasing the number of programs offered at each of its twelve campuses 
programs that are currently being offered by the company will be transplanted to other campuses 
campuses currently offer an average of five of the company s twelve primary programs 
the company has experience teaching each of the programs targeted for transplant  however due to regulatory requirements each transplanted program must receive its own regulatory approvals before being offered at a campus 
the company did not achieve its goal of transplanting new programs in and early the company is generally required to hire staff  purchase equipment and have classroom space available prior to submitting new programs to accreditation bodies for approval 
as a result the company has incurred expenses for new program transplants occupancy  depreciation and faculty in advance of student enrollments 
the company has invested capital expenditures to improve and expand facilities over the last two and one half years 
additional space has been added at all of the company s locations 
five campuses were moved to larger facilities in the past two years  san bernardino  california in february  arlington  texas in june  san diego  california in january  denver  colorado in march  and portland  oregon in september capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment were  in   in  and  in the addition of classrooms and upgraded facilities has  and will provide the company the space to expand program offerings at its campuses 
three programs were added in  practical nursing  medical assistant  and surgical technology 
the company added eleven programs in  one in the first quarter  two in the second quarter  three in the third quarter and five in the fourth quarter 
the company has traditionally relied primarily on television and newspaper advertising to generate leads from prospective students 
we increased the portion of our advertising expense dedicated to the internet beginning in the fourth quarter of the investment in internet advertising has resulted in a dramatic increase in the amount of internet leads compared to total leads and now represents over of the company s total leads 
the company must improve its effectiveness in converting internet leads into enrollments 
the company s revenue varies based on student enrollment and population 
the number of students that attend our campuses  the number of new enrollments during a fiscal period  student retention rates and general economic conditions impact student population 
the introduction of new programs at certain campuses  improved advertising effectiveness and student retention have been significant factors of increased student population in prior years 
the company and each of its campuses are subject to extensive regulation 
these regulations cover virtually all phases of the company s operations  including the company s educational programs  facilities  instructional and administrative staff  administrative procedures  financial operations and financial strength 
they also affect the company s ability to acquire or open additional campuses or change the company s corporate structure 
these regulatory agencies periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements 
each of the company s campuses must be authorized by the state in which it operates  accredited by an accrediting commission that the us department of education ed recognizes  and certified by the ed to participate in title iv programs 
any substantial restrictions on the campuses ability to participate in title iv programs would adversely affect our ability to enroll students  expand programs and student population 
the company had a reduction in enrollments in one clinical program at one campus due to state board programmatic provisional accreditation extension beginning with the second quarter of the company received notification in may that the program would not be allowed to enroll additional students until yearly average minimum pass rates on the licensure examination for graduates were within acceptable levels as required by the state board 
as a result the campus can not enroll students in the program without obtaining state board approval 
the company believes that it has made appropriate changes to increase pass rates to an acceptable level 
however  there can be no assurance that the state board will approve additional enrollments in the future and the board may require the company to terminate the program 
this change reduced forecasted enrollments by approximately students in the second quarter  in the third quarter  and in the fourth quarter of for a total of for the year 
the company classifies programs in three general categories clinical  core and other 
clinical programs surgical technology  respiratory therapy  radiologic technology  and practical vocational nurse are generally to months in length 
the weekend vocational nursing program and radiological technician are longer  and months respectively 
clinical programs utilize clinical training that occurs in a hospital or medical facility 
core programs medical assistant  dental assistant  massage therapy  medical office professional  and insurance coding and billing specialist are generally to months in length and utilize an externship immediately prior to graduation 
externships occur in medical offices  dental offices  medical and dental clinics  medical facilities  and hospitals 
the remaining programs are similar in nature to the core programs but are not currently offered in as many campuses as the core programs 
part ii p revenues fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business and due to capacity and scheduling limitations 
these factors impact student population which varies as a result of new student enrollments and student attrition 
historically  the campuses have had lower student enrollments in the fourth quarter of the year compared to the remainder of the year 
this is due to fewer scheduled enrollments during the holiday periods of november and december 
in addition  the campuses utilize a non traditional academic calendar with program start dates varying by location and type of program 
programs vary in length generally from to months 
this impacts the scheduling of new starts in some programs 
expenses  however  do not vary as significantly as student population and revenues 
the company expects quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of enrollment patterns  capacity and scheduling limitations 
such patterns may change  however  as a result of acquisitions  new school openings  increased capacity and new program introductions 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
the company s campuses must be authorized by the state in which it operates  accredited by an accrediting commission that the us department of education ed recognizes  and certified by the ed to participate in title iv programs 
any substantial restrictions on the campuses ability to participate in title iv programs would adversely affect our ability to enroll students 
the company establishes an accounts receivable and a corresponding deferred revenue liability for each student upon commencement of a program of study 
the deferred revenue liability  consisting of tuition and non refundable registration fees  is recognized into income ratably over the length of the program 
if a student withdraws from a program  the unearned portion of the tuition for which the student has paid is refunded on a pro rata basis 
textbook and uniform sales are recognized when they occur 
any unpaid balance due when the student withdraws is generally due directly from the student  not from a federal or state agency 
accounts receivable are due from students and are primarily expected to be paid through the use of federal and state sources of funds 
students are responsible for amounts not available through federal and state sources and unpaid amounts due when the student withdraws 
the company realized a higher level of uncollectible accounts receivable from students since october this was a result of the higher education act of hea refund provision that became effective october  under the hea requirements  students are obligated to the company for education costs that the student can no longer pay with hea title iv funds 
the company expects that non title iv accounts and notes receivable due from students may increase in the future as student enrollment increases and that the related provision for uncollectible accounts may also increase

enrollments decreased at one campus due to a state board programmatic provisional accreditation extension see overview 
the remaining decrease of was a result of reduced enrollments in programs that have been active for at least twelve months 
the decline in enrollments in this category is due to increased competition in health care programs and the company s inability to convert new student inquiries into enrollments 
the company has changed its advertising mix and has increased leads from the internet while reducing reliance on television and newspaper leads

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from those estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
the company evaluates on a continuing basis  our estimates  including those related to allowance for uncollectible accounts and intangible assets 
the company bases estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements allowance for uncollectible accounts accounts and notes receivable are due from students and are expected to be paid primarily through the use of federal and state sources of funds 
students are responsible for amounts not available through federal and state sources and unpaid amounts due when the student withdraws 
the company offers a variety of payment plans to students for payment of the portion of their education expense not covered by financial aid programs 
these balances are unsecured and not guaranteed 
the company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or failure of our students to make required payments 
the company bases its allowance for uncollectible accounts on the aging of student payments 
historical experience of the collectbility of student payments is analyzed to assign each aging category a percentage that the company believes will be uncollectible 
the allowance percentages range from to based on the aging category of the student balances 
the company continually tests its allowance and has found that it is reasonable 
the company realized a higher level of uncollectible accounts receivable from students during compared to the provision for uncollectible accounts as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in depending on the effectiveness of the company s internal and external collection efforts  the provision for uncollectible accounts may vary as a percentage of revenue in future periods 
the company expects that non title iv accounts and notes receivable due from students may increase in the future as student enrollment increases and that the related provision for uncollectible accounts may also increase 
based on the company s analysis  the company believes its allowance for uncollectible accounts is reasonable 
however  losses may exceed the allowance if students pay at different rates than they did historically 
intangible assets the company has intangible assets  including goodwill and non compete agreements 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
the company reviews intangible assets whenever certain events occur or there are changes in circumstances for impairment by comparing the carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows 
to the extent that there is impairment  analysis is performed based on several criteria  including but not limited to  revenue trends  discounted operating cash flows and other operating factors to determine the impairment amount 
in addition  a determination is made by management to ascertain whether goodwill has been impaired 
analysis is performed on an operating business unit basis under the fair value method 
if the review indicates that goodwill is not recoverable  the company would recognize an impairment loss 
part ii p revenue recognition the company establishes an account receivable and a corresponding deferred revenue liability for each student upon commencement of a program of study 
the deferred revenue liability  consisting of tuition and non refundable registration fees  is recognized into income ratably over the length of the program including externship if applicable 
if a student withdraws from a program  the unearned portion of the tuition for which the student has paid is refunded on a pro rata basis 
textbook and uniform sales are recognized when they occur
