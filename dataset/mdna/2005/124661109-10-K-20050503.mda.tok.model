item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all dollar amounts in this item are in thousands  except per share amounts and per pound lead amounts 
overview during fiscal year  major items that impacted our financial results include i a  non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge related to our power electronics division  ii the aforementioned acquisitions and associated financial results of celab  datel and cps  which are included in the results of operations of our power electronics division  and iii the increased cost of lead  which had a significant negative impact on the results of our standby power and motive power divisions 
see item exhibits and financial statement schedules related to the goodwill impairment charge 
impact of economy and shift in customer demand during fiscal year  our standby power division experienced higher demand for products sold to the ups markets  while demand for our standby power products sold into the telecommunication markets continued to soften 
demand for our motive power products and power electronics division products excluding the fiscal year acquisitions increased over fiscal raw material pricing and productivity lead  steel  copper  plastics and electronic components are the major raw materials used in the manufacture of our industrial batteries and electronics products and  accordingly  represent a significant portion of our materials costs 
during fiscal years  and  the average london metals exchange lme price per pound of lead was as follows fiscal average annual lme price per pound of lead lowest average monthly lme price per pound of lead highest average monthly lme price per pound of lead we have a long term cost containment program to minimize manufacturing costs 
under the program  we continue to allocate a significant amount of our normal annual capital expenditures to cost containment and productivity improvement projects 
inflation the cost to c d of manufacturing materials and labor and most other operating costs are affected by inflationary pressures 
lead prices continued to rise in fiscal year  and we have not been able to fully offset the higher lead prices through selective price increases 
we believe that  over recent years  we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases on items other than lead by o effective raw materials purchasing programs  o increases in labor productivity  o improvements in overall manufacturing efficiencies  and o selective price increases of our products 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items in c d s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated

critical accounting policies we have identified the critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the policies set forth below require management s most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
litigation and environmental reserves c d is involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business  including personal injury  property damage and environmental litigation 
we also expend funds for environmental remediation of both company owned and third party locations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities  we record a loss and establish a reserve for litigation or remediation when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability exists and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
reasonable estimates involve judgments made by management after considering a broad range of information including notifications  demands or settlements that have been received from a regulatory authority or private party  estimates performed by independent engineering companies and outside counsel  available facts  existing and proposed technology  the identification of other prps  their ability to contribute and prior experience 
these judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary 
however  the reserves may materially differ from ultimate actual liabilities if the loss contingency is difficult to estimate or if management s judgments turn out to be inaccurate 
if management believes no best estimate exists  the minimum loss is accrued 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the related total future net cash flows 
if an asset grouping s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analyses 
pension and other employee benefits certain assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits 
these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels  expected long term rates of return on assets and increases or trends in health care costs 
if actual results are less favorable than those projected by management  additional expense may be required 
inventory reserves c d adjusts the value of its obsolete and unmarketable inventory to the estimated market value based upon assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts c d maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
warranty reserves c d provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers products and processes  c d s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  warranty replacement costs and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  warranty replacement costs or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be made 
deferred tax valuation allowance c d records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event c d was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that c d would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
revenue recognition c d recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete 
this occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of the agreement  title and risk of loss have been transferred  collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable 
accruals are made for sales returns and other allowances based on our experience 
while returns have historically been minimal and within the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
goodwill and other indefinite lived assets are not amortized and are subject to the impairment rules of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which c d adopted on february  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of certain circumstances or events 
c d determines the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of financial projections and discounted cash flow techniques adjusted for risk characteristics  also giving consideration to c d s overall market capitalization 
the fair market value of the reporting units is compared to the carrying value of the reporting units to determine if an impairment loss should be calculated 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an impairment loss is indicated 
the loss is calculated by comparing the fair value of the goodwill to the book value of the goodwill 
if the book value of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recorded 
fair value of goodwill is determined by subtracting the fair value of the identifiable assets of a reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development costs consist of direct and indirect internal costs related to specific projects 
the cost of materials whether from our normal inventory or acquired specially for research and development activities and equipment or facilities that are acquired or constructed for research and development activities and that have alternative future uses in research and development projects or otherwise are capitalized as tangible assets when acquired or constructed 
the cost of such materials consumed in research and development activities and the depreciation of such equipment or facilities used in those activities are recorded as research and development costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal all comparisons are with the corresponding periods in the previous year  unless otherwise stated 
three acquisitions occurred during fiscal year on may   we acquired celab  based in hampshire  united kingdom  a provider of power conversion products  predominately sold into military  catv and telecommunications applications in europe 
on june   we acquired datel  a mansfield  massachusetts based manufacturer of dc to dc converters  data acquisition components and digital meters 
on september   we acquired the power systems division of celestica  inc  which we now operate as cps  a toronto  ontario based company 
cps develops dc to dc converters and ac to dc power supplies which are sold on a direct basis to large computing and communications oems 
for reporting purposes  these three acquisitions are part of the power electronics division 
net sales for fiscal year increased  or to  from  in fiscal year this increase resulted primarily from the aforementioned acquisitions coupled with improved customer demand for products of all three divisions 
sales of the power electronics division increased  or  primarily due to net sales of  recorded by the entities acquired during the year  coupled with higher sales by the legacy portion of the power electronics division  which increased by  or  primarily due to higher dc to dc converter sales 
sales by the standby power division increased  or  primarily due to increased sales to the ups market  partially offset by continued weakness in the telecommunications market 
motive power divisional sales increased  or  primarily due to higher battery and charger sales 
gross profit for fiscal year declined  or to  from  with margins decreasing from to 
gross profit in the standby power and motive power divisions declined primarily as a result of non cash impairment charges at our leola  pennsylvania  and huguenot  new york  facilities totaling  and associated environmental clean up charges at these two facilities in the amount of  coupled with an increase in the cost of lead of approximately  additionally  there were rigging  transportation and severance costs related to the transfer of production to our reynosa  mexico  facility of approximately  gross profit in the power electronics division increased primarily due to the results of the acquisitions coupled with the favorable impact of increased sales by the legacy portion of the power electronics division 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased  or 
this increase was primarily due to selling  general and administrative expenses of  incurred by the current year acquisitions 
excluding the acquired companies  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  primarily as a result of lower warranty costs of  and lower commissions of  partially offset by sarbanes oxley compliance costs of  research and development expenses for fiscal year increased  or 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses increased from during fiscal year to during fiscal year the increase was primarily the result of  of research and development expenses incurred by our recent acquisitions  including acquired in process research and development expenses of related to the acquired companies and intangible asset impairment charges of the impairment was related to certain intellectual property of the power electronics division resulting from a decline in financial projections of certain products 
goodwill impairment charges of  were recorded in the power electronics division for the fiscal year ended january  no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in the standby power division 
all of the goodwill of the motive power division was written off in fiscal year c d determined the fair value of its reporting units  using a combination of financial projections and discounted cash flow techniques adjusted for risk characteristics  also giving consideration to c d s overall market capitalization 
see item exhibits and financial statement schedules related to the goodwill impairment charge 
operating loss income for fiscal year decreased  or to an operating loss of  from operating income of  in fiscal year this decrease was primarily the result of goodwill and intangible impairment charges in the power electronics division  lower operating income in the standby power division  coupled with a higher operating loss in the motive power division 
below is a summary of key items affecting operating loss income for fiscal year analysis of change in operating loss income fiscal year vs 
operating income fiscal  motive power division operations  lead increased cost  reynosa rigging  transportation  severance impairments and related environmental clean up  standby power division operations  lead increased cost  reynosa rigging  transportation  severance impairments and related environmental clean up  power electronics division operations legacy  operations acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets impairment  operating loss income fiscal  interest expense  net  increased  in fiscal year  primarily due to higher average debt balances outstanding during the period due to funds borrowed to finance the celab  datel and cps acquisitions 
there was an income tax benefit of  recorded in fiscal year as a result of a net loss before income taxes  compared to income tax expense of  in fiscal year the effective tax rate consists of statutory rates adjusted for the tax impacts of foreign operations and other permanent items 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year reflects a benefit of compared to a provision of in the prior year 
the benefit recorded in fiscal year was adjusted from the statutory rate to reflect the tax effect of the goodwill impairment  an increase to the valuation allowance relating to foreign tax credits for the unremitted earnings of a controlled foreign subsidiary  and the impact of non deductible acquired in process research and development assets related to the datel acquisition 
minority interest reflects the ownership interest in the joint venture battery business located in shanghai  china  that is not owned by c d 
the joint venture incurred a net loss in fiscal year compared to net income in the prior year 
as a result of all of the above  a net loss was recorded of  compared to net income of  in the prior year 
on a per share basis  net loss was compared to net income of basic and fully diluted for fiscal years and  respectively 
fiscal compared to fiscal effective february   we combined the former dynasty and powercom divisions into the newly created standby power division 
the foregoing results of operations reported using the former dynasty and powercom divisions have been combined and reclassified under the standby power division 
all comparisons are with the corresponding periods in the previous year  unless otherwise stated 
net sales for fiscal year decreased  or to  from  in fiscal year this decrease resulted from lower customer demand for products of all divisions 
sales of the power electronics division fell  or  mainly due to lower dc to dc converter sales 
power electronics had a solid fourth quarter  with revenue increasing across the division 
this division introduced over new products in fiscal year  accounting for approximately of the division s revenue 
motive power divisional sales dropped  or due to lower sales of batteries and chargers 
standby power division sales decreased  or less than 
gross profit for fiscal year decreased  or to  from  in the prior year 
gross margin increased slightly from in fiscal year to in fiscal year gross profit declined in the standby power division  primarily as a result of startup costs of approximately  at our new reynosa  mexico  facility and higher lead costs  partially offset by a favorable year end lifo inventory adjustment of  gross profit in the motive power division increased on lower sales  primarily due to the improvement in plant operational effectiveness in fiscal year  partially offset by higher lead costs 
gross profit in the power electronics division increased on lower sales primarily due to the re organization charges of  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year related to the closure of our shannon  ireland  facility and the benefits of relocating certain mexican manufacturing activities to our guangzhou  china  facility  which has lower manufacturing costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased  or 
this increase was primarily due to  of higher warranty costs  higher payroll related costs of  and the prior year gain of  recognized on the sale of our conshohocken  pennsylvania  facility  partially offset by lower variable selling costs of associated with the decreased sales volumes 
research and development expenses for fiscal year increased or less than 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses increased from of sales in fiscal year to of sales in fiscal year goodwill impairment charges of were recorded in the motive power division for the fiscal year ended january   resulting in the complete write off of the motive power division s goodwill 
operating income decreased  or to  from  in the prior year 
this decrease was the result of lower operating income generated by the standby power division  partially offset by a lower operating loss in the motive power division and operating income in the power electronics division in fiscal year compared to an operating loss in fiscal year interest expense  net  decreased  in fiscal year compared to the prior year  primarily due to lower average debt balances outstanding during the year  coupled with a lower effective interest rate 
income tax expense for fiscal year decreased from fiscal year  primarily as the result of lower income before income taxes  partially offset by an increase in our effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate consists of statutory rates adjusted for the tax impacts of foreign operations 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year increased to from in the prior year  primarily as a result of the favorable resolution of state tax audits in the fourth quarter of fiscal year minority interest of in fiscal year reflects the ownership interest in the joint venture battery business located in shanghai  china  that is not owned by c d 
the decrease in minority interest was due to lower profitability of the shanghai joint venture 
as a result of the above  for fiscal year  net income decreased  or to  or per share basic and per share diluted 
future outlook during fiscal year  we completed the transition of our motive power v line r and former standby power hd products now replaced by the mse and msendur tm product lines to our reynosa  mexico  facility 
our results of operations continue to be negatively affected by higher raw material pricing  and we anticipate that high lead pricing will continue to adversely affect our profitability in the near term 
higher lead prices negatively affected operating results in fiscal year by approximately  compared to the prior year 
in fiscal year  to mitigate rising lead costs  we increased prices where competitive situations allowed and reviewed incoming business on an order by order basis and selectively declined business where the price cost relationship was not in proper balance 
currently  we are hedged on approximately of our first half fiscal year lead requirements  and we continue to monitor the lead market for favorable buying opportunities 
the chinese government previously notified our joint venture that it will be required to relocate the shanghai facility and has paid our joint venture approximately  as partial payment  which we intend to apply towards construction of a new facility in the pudong development zone 
our joint venture is prepared to break ground in the third quarter of fiscal year and anticipates production will begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal year upon return of the existing property to the chinese government  it will pay the joint venture an additional  liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities decreased  or to  for the fiscal year ended january   compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activity was primarily due to i a net loss in fiscal year compared to net income in fiscal year  ii a decrease from a net deferred tax liability to a net deferred tax asset in fiscal year compared to an increase in net deferred tax liabilities in fiscal year  and iii a net reduction to current taxes payable due to the tax benefit recorded for federal and state tax purposes compared to an increase to taxes payable in the prior period 
these changes  resulting in lower net cash provided by operating activities  were partially offset by i non cash charges for impairments to goodwill  intangible assets and fixed assets  and increases to depreciation and amortization in fiscal year  ii decreases in accounts and other notes receivable  and iii increases to accounts payable and other liabilities in fiscal year compared to decreases in fiscal year net cash used by investing activities increased  or to  in the fiscal year as compared to  in the prior fiscal year  primarily due to the acquisitions of celab  datel and cps in the current fiscal year 
this increase was partially offset by the receipt of approximately  from the chinese government as partial payment for the shanghai joint venture s existing battery facility 
we intend to use these funds for the future construction of a new battery manufacturing facility in shanghai  china 
we had net cash provided by financing activities of  in fiscal year as compared to net cash used by financing activities of  in the prior fiscal year 
current year financing activities included  from new borrowings  primarily used to finance the acquisitions of celab  datel and cps 
this was partially offset by  used to acquire treasury stock 
prior year net cash used by financing activities included  for the reduction of debt and  for the purchase of treasury stock 
on june   we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement credit agreement or facility  with a maturity date of june  the financing was arranged by banc of america securities llc 
under the credit agreement  the amount of the facility was increased to  from  with the option  under certain conditions  to increase the facility to  the facility was increased to  on august   at our request 
the credit agreement included lender approval of the datel and cps acquisitions 
the credit agreement includes a  sub limit for loans in certain foreign currencies 
the interest rates are determined by our leverage ratio and are available at libor plus to libor plus or prime  to prime plus 
the initial loans were priced at libor plus or prime plus 
the rates may be adjusted based on the leverage ratio calculated after the conclusion of each quarter 
the credit agreement requires that we pay a fee of 
to 
per annum on any unused portion of the facility  based on the leverage ratio 
the credit agreement includes a letter of credit facility not to exceed  and swingline loans not to exceed  the credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that require us to maintain minimum ratios such as fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios as well as minimum consolidated net worth 
these covenants permit us to pay dividends so long as there are no defaults under the credit agreement 
c d was not in compliance with its leverage ratio covenant at january  we obtained a waiver of this violation on february  we entered into the second amendment to the credit agreement to modify this ratio through the remaining term of the agreement 
the second amendment requires c d to pledge certain assets as collateral on a going forward basis 
the interest rates determined by our leverage ratio were also changed as a result of this second amendment 
the rates available to c d are now libor plus to libor plus or prime to prime plus 
the second amendment also modifies other provisions of the credit agreement such that it permits c d to exclude the write down of up to  of goodwill from the minimum net worth covenant calculation  to exclude up to  in severance costs in fiscal year as well as to exclude all future non cash stock option or restricted stock expense from certain covenant calculations 
further  the second amendment requires c d to maintain minimum levels of trailing earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as calculated quarterly through fiscal year on april   we entered into the third amendment to the credit agreement to correct and revise the definitional term consolidated ebitda 
the availability under the credit agreement is expected to be sufficient to meet our ongoing cash needs for working capital requirements  debt service and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures during fiscal year were incurred to fund cost reduction programs  normal maintenance and regulatory compliance 
fiscal year capital expenditures are expected to be approximately  primarily for the construction of our new shanghai joint venture facility of which approximately  has already been received from the chinese government to fund construction  upgrades to our reynosa  mexico  facility and other items expended for similar purposes as fiscal year contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables summarize our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases      inventory   total contractual cash obligations      amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than after other commercial commitments committed year years years years mortgage   capital lease    revolving credit facility   other standby letters of credit    total commercial commitments     new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  which adopts wording from the international accounting standards board s iasb international accounting standard ias no 
inventories in an effort to improve the comparability of cross border financial reporting 
the fasb and iasb both believe the standards have the same intent  however  an amendment was adopted to avoid inconsistent application 
the new standard indicates that abnormal freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage are required to be treated as current period charges rather than as a portion of inventory cost 
additionally  the standard clarifies that fixed production overhead should be allocated based on the normal capacity of a production facility 
the statement is effective for c d beginning in fiscal year adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no

this sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first annual period beginning after december  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal year sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt these requirements using one of two methods o a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
o a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
c d is evaluating the impact of adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
r 
we currently expect to apply the provisions of sfas no 
r utilizing the modified prospective method 
in anticipation of the implementation of sfas no 
r  c d accelerated the vesting of all stock options granted under the and stock option plans as of march   therefore  these options will not be expensed in future periods

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk all dollar amounts in this item a are in thousands 
market risk factors we are exposed to various market risks 
the primary financial risks include fluctuations in interest rates and changes in currency exchange rates 
we manage these risks by using derivative instruments 
we do not invest in derivative securities for speculative purposes  but do enter into hedging arrangements in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates as well as to fluctuations in exchange rates 
our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk consist of debt instruments and interest rate swap contracts 
the net market value of our debt instruments excluding capital leases was  and  at january  and  respectively 
the debt instruments are subject to variable rate interest and therefore  the market value is not sensitive to interest rate movements 
interest rate swap contracts are used to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our underlying variable rate debt instruments 
we employ separate swap transactions rather than fixed rate obligations to take advantage of the lower borrowing costs associated with floating rate debt while also avoiding the costs associated with refinancing in the fixed rate market 
the net market value of our interest rate swaps was and  at january  and  respectively 
a basis point increase in rates at january  and would result in a and a increase in the market value  respectively 
a basis point decrease in rates at january  and would result in a and a decrease in the market value  respectively 
the above sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their year end levels  with all other variables held constant 
we calculate the market value of the interest rate swaps by utilizing a standard net present value model based on the market conditions as of the valuation date 
we use currency forwards and swaps to hedge anticipated cash flows in foreign currencies 
the exposures currently hedged are the british pound  the euro  the japanese yen and canadian dollar 
these financial instruments represent a net market value of and at january  and  respectively 
to monitor our currency exchange rate risk  we use sensitivity analysis to measure the impact on earnings in the case of a change in exchange rates 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables being held constant 
at january  and  a strengthening of the us dollar versus these currencies would result in an increase of the net market value of the forwards of and  respectively 
at january  and  a weakening of the us dollar versus these currencies would result in a decrease in the net market value of the forwards of and  respectively
