item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background on january   we announced our intention to acquire icsi 
icsi was a public company in taiwan and traded on the gre tai securities market otc 
icsi is a fabless semiconductor company whose principal products are dram and controller chips 
prior to this transaction  we owned approximately of icsi and two issi directors  mr 
lee and mr 
tanigami  held seats on the board of icsi 
in addition  we owned approximately million of icsi convertible debentures at march  in the nine months ended september   we purchased additional shares of icsi in the open market for approximately million increasing our ownership percentage to approximately at september  the total purchase price for this interest was approximately million 
we plan to acquire substantially all of the remaining outstanding shares of icsi for cash of approximately million 
our financial results for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal through the period ended april  reflect accounting for icsi on the equity basis and include our percentage share of the results of icsi s operations 
on may   we assumed effective control of icsi and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we began consolidating the financial results of icsi with our own results as of may  our financial results for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal through the period ended november  reflect accounting for signia technologies inc signia on the cost basis 
effective december  our ownership of signia became greater than and we began consolidating the results of signia 
our financial results for fiscal through the month period ending april  reflect accounting for our investment in e cmos technology corporation e cmos on the equity basis and include our percentage share of the results of e cmos operations 
effective may  our ownership of e cmos became less than and we began accounting for e cmos on the cost basis 
our financial results for fiscal and fiscal until their ipo in march  reflect accounting for semiconductor manufacturing international corporation smic on the cost basis 
since smic s ipo  we account for our shares in smic under the provisions of fasb and have marked our investment to the market value as of september  by increasing other assets and by increasing accumulated comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet 
icsi is a taiwan based fabless memory supplier  e cmos is a taiwan based peripherals interface device company  signia is a developer of wireless semiconductors  and smic is a china based semiconductor foundry 
at september   we owned approximately of icsi  approximately of signia  approximately of e cmos and less than of smic 
overview we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs and markets high performance integrated circuits for the following key markets i digital consumer electronics  ii networking  iii mobile communications and iv automotive electronics 
our primary products are high speed and low power sram and low and medium density dram 
we also design and market eeproms  smartcards  controller chips for flash memory sticks and card reader writers and wireless chipsets 
we were founded in october and initially focused on high performance  low cost sram for pc cache memory applications 
in  we introduced our first low and medium density dram products 
prior to fiscal  our sram product family generated a majority of our revenue 
however  in  the high end networking and telecom markets slowed and this adversely impacted our sram revenue 
during this period  we increased our focus on the digital consumer electronics  mobile communications and automotive electronics markets 
as a result of our success in the digital consumer electronics market  sales of our low and medium density dram products have increased significantly and have represented a majority of our net sales in each year since fiscal in order to limit and control our operating expenses  in recent years we have reduced our headcount in the us and transferred various functions to our subsidiary in taiwan and our subsidiary in china 
our acquisition of icsi was a key part of this strategy 
we believe this strategy has enabled us to limit our operating expenses 
table of contents while simultaneously locating these functions closer to our manufacturing partners and our customers 
as a result of these efforts  we currently have significantly more employees in asia than we do in the us we intend to continue these strategies going forward 
as a fabless semiconductor company  our business model is less capital intensive because we rely on third parties to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
because of our dependence on third party wafer foundries  our ability to increase our unit sales volumes depends on our ability to increase our wafer capacity allocation from current foundries  add additional foundries and improve yields of die per wafer 
although average selling prices of our sram and dram products have generally declined over time  the selling prices are very sensitive to supply and demand conditions in our target markets 
while the average selling prices for certain of our products increased during the first three quarters of fiscal  the average selling prices for our products declined significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal we experienced further declines in the average selling prices for certain of our products in the four quarters of fiscal we expect average selling prices for our products to decline in the future  principally due to increased market competition and an increased supply of competitive products in the market 
any future decreases in our average selling prices would have an adverse impact on our revenue growth rate  gross margins and operating margins 
our ability to maintain or increase revenues will be highly dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in average selling prices of existing products 
declining average selling prices will adversely affect gross margins unless we are able to offset such declines with commensurate reductions in per unit costs or changes in product mix in favor of higher margin products 
revenue from product sales to our direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
a portion of our sales is made to distributors under agreements that provide the possibility of certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of returns and other credits that will be issued to these distributors  we defer recognition of such sales until our products are sold by the distributors to their end customers 
revenue from sales to distributors who do not have sales price rebates or product return privileges is recognized at the time our products are sold by us to the distributors 
we market and sell our products in asia  the us and europe through our direct sales force  distributors and sales representatives 
the percentage of our revenues shipped outside the us was approximately  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
we measure revenue location by the shipping destination  even if the customer is headquartered in the us we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to represent a significant percentage of our net sales 
the percentages of our revenues by region are set forth in the following table fiscal years ended september  asia europe us other total our sales are generally made by purchase orders 
because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice  backlog is not a good indicator of our future sales 
cancellations of customer orders or changes in product specifications could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 

table of contents since a significant portion of our revenue is from the digital consumer electronics market  our business may be subject to seasonality  with increased revenues in the third and fourth calendar quarters of each year  when customers place orders to meet year end holiday demand 
however  broad fluctuations in our overall business in the past several years makes it difficult for us to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including economic conditions in asia  particularly taiwan and china  changes in trade policy and regulatory requirements  duties  tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  the burdens of complying with foreign laws and  possibly  political instability 
all of our foundries and assembly and test subcontractors are located in asia 
although we transact business predominately in us dollars  we do have some transactions in new taiwan dollars  in hong kong dollars and in china renminbi 
such transactions expose us to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
we monitor our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  but have not to date adopted any hedging strategy 
there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business and operating results in the future 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales consist principally of total product sales less estimated sales returns 
net sales increased slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal fiscal includes five months of revenue of approximately million attributable to the consolidation of icsi beginning may  however  the million attributable to the consolidation of icsi is not necessarily indicative of the operations of icsi on a stand alone basis as we transferred certain customers between issi and icsi after may   based upon geographic location 
in fiscal  the decrease in revenue from the sale of our dram and sram products was offset by an increase in sales of non memory products from our acquisitions of icsi and signia 
the decrease in dram revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal can be attributed primarily to a decrease in the average selling prices of our mb dram devices which was not fully offset by the increase in unit shipments 
increased unit shipments of our mb and mb dram devices in fiscal more than offset the decline in average selling prices for such products resulting in an increase in revenue attributable to those devices 
the decline in revenue from our sram products in fiscal compared to fiscal can be attributed to an overall decline in both unit shipments and average selling prices of our sram products 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our existing products will generally decline over time  although the rate of decline may fluctuate for certain products 
there can be no assurance that any future price declines will be offset by higher volumes or by higher prices on newer products 
in fiscal and fiscal  no single customer accounted for over of net sales 
gross profit 
cost of sales includes die cost from the wafers acquired from foundries  subcontracted package  assembly and test costs  quality assurance and import duties 
gross profit decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded inventory write downs of million predominately as a result of applying our lower of cost or market inventory valuation policy 
in fiscal  we recorded inventory write downs of million predominately for lower of cost or market adjustments and  to a lesser extent  excess inventory 
excluding the effect of the inventory write downs  the decrease in gross profit can be attributed primarily to a decrease in the average selling prices of our mb dram devices in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  declines in the average selling prices of our dram products more than offset declines in the cost of our dram products in fiscal compared to fiscal  resulting in a decline in our dram gross margin 
an overall decline in both unit shipments and average selling prices of our sram products in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted in a decrease in our sram gross profit 
our gross profit in fiscal benefited from the sale of non memory products from our acquisitions of icsi and signia 
we believe that the average selling prices of our products will decline over time and  unless we are able to reduce our cost per unit to the extent necessary to offset such declines  the decline in average selling prices will result in a material decline in our gross margin 
in addition  product unit costs could increase if our suppliers raise prices  which could result in a material decline in our gross margin 
in the past  foundries have raised wafer prices when 
table of contents demand for end products increases 
although we have product cost reduction programs in place that involve efforts to reduce internal costs and supplier costs  there can be no assurance that product costs will be reduced or that such reductions will be sufficient to offset the expected declines in average selling prices 
we do not believe that such cost reduction efforts are likely to have a material adverse impact on the quality of our products or the level of service provided by us 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in absolute dollars was primarily the result of a reduction in expenses associated with new product development as we limited the focus of our development efforts  resulting in a reduction in mask costs 
in addition  payroll related expenses in the us and depreciation expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal these factors were partially offset by an increase in research and development expenses attributable to our consolidation of signia  beginning in december  and icsi  beginning in may see in process research and development below 
the increased costs associated with the development of new products could result in our research and development expenses increasing in absolute dollars in future periods 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to our consolidation of signia  beginning in december  and icsi  beginning in may in the september quarter  we recorded a charge to allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million  primarily for amounts due from delphi electronics 
in addition  we had a million write off of excess facility space in our santa clara headquarters in the march quarter 
changes in corporate governance rules  in particular  complying with the internal control requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of section  have had and will continue to result in increased internal efforts  significantly higher fees from our independent accounting firm and significantly higher fees from third party contractors 
as a result  our selling  general and administrative expenses may increase in absolute dollars in future quarters  although such expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
in process research and development 
in december  we acquired a majority ownership in signia 
as of march   we had increased our ownership in signia to approximately by buying common shares from other shareholders 
the cost of this additional investment was approximately million in cash  which includes million in estimated transaction costs 
prior to this increase  we owned approximately of the outstanding equity of signia and accounted for our investment on the cost basis 
since we increased our ownership to  beginning from december  we consolidate signia s financial statements with our own 
the total purchase price  including our previous investment of million  was million 
the allocation of the purchase price of signia includes both tangible assets and acquired intangible assets  including developed technology as well as in process research and development ipr d 
the million allocated to ipr d was expensed  as it was deemed to have no future alternative value 
in fiscal  we purchased additional shares of icsi in the open market for approximately million  increasing our ownership percentage to approximately at september  the total purchase price  including our previous investment of million  was million 
we consolidated the icsi financials with our own effective may  the allocation of the purchase price of icsi includes both tangible assets and acquired intangible assets  including both developed technology and in process research and development ipr d 
the million allocated to ipr d was expensed as it was deemed to have no future alternative value 
the valuation and purchase allocation is subject to further adjustment as issi purchases additional shares of icsi 
there will be an additional charge to ipr d in the december quarter as additional shares of icsi are acquired 

table of contents impairment of goodwill 
in september  we recorded an impairment charge for the goodwill related to our acquisition of signia of approximately million 
the write off was required as it became evident  based on anticipated cash flows  that the product line had not generated and would be unable to generate future cash flows to support the goodwill amount 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net was million of other income in fiscal compared to million of other income in fiscal the million of other income in fiscal is comprised primarily of interest income of million and the gain on the sale of assets of million offset by million in foreign currency exchange losses and million in impairment losses related to two of our cost method equity investments 
the million other income in fiscal was comprised primarily of interest income 
gain on sale of investments 
in fiscal  we sold shares of smic for approximately million which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
in addition  we sold our investment in nexflash including shares held by icsi for approximately million  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
in fiscal  we sold shares of smic for approximately million  resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
provision for income taxes 
for fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of  consisting of the reversal of previously provided taxes that are no longer necessary offset by foreign withholding tax and state minimum taxes 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal of  reflects taxes for us federal alternative minimum tax  state minimum tax and tax in certain foreign jurisdictions 
we have a recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to our operating loss history and our expectation of future taxable income 
we review the realization of these deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
any release of the valuation allowance would have a favorable impact on the provision for income taxes within our statement of operations 
minority interest in net loss of consolidated subsidiary 
the minority interest in net loss of consolidated subsidiary includes the minority shareholders proportionate share of the net loss of signia for the ten months ended september   and the minority shareholders proportionate share of the net loss of icsi for the five months ended september  equity in net income loss of affiliated companies 
equity in net income loss of affiliated companies was an million loss in fiscal compared to million income in fiscal this primarily reflects a decline in icsi s financial results as a result of inventory write downs in the seven months ended april  prior to our consolidation of icsi s financial results compared to fiscal in addition  in fiscal  we recorded a loss of approximately million related to our equity interest in key stream corp 
ksc  an investment of icsi s 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in sales was principally due to an increase in the average selling prices of our dram products  specifically our and mb devices  in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  sales in fiscal benefited from shipments of our mb dram product 
an increase in unit shipments of our sram products in fiscal compared to fiscal  more than offset any declines in the average selling prices for such products resulting in an overall increase in sram revenue 
in fiscal  no single customer accounted for over of net sales 
sales to atm electronic corporation  one of our asian distributors  accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal a substantial portion of our sales to atm were for delivery to ambit

research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in absolute dollars was primarily the result of a reduction in expenses through the closing of our design centers in korea and hong kong  a reduction of headcount and related expenses in the us  and the transfer of some design and engineering efforts to the lower cost asian countries of china and taiwan 
in addition  depreciation expense and contracted development costs decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative

equity in net income loss of affiliated companies 
equity in net income loss of affiliated companies was million income in fiscal compared to a million loss in fiscal this primarily reflected an improvement in icsi s financial results in the twelve months ended september  compared to the twelve months ended september  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of september   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of approximately million 
during fiscal  operating activities provided cash of approximately million compared to million used in fiscal the cash provided by operations was primarily due to decreases in inventories of million as a result of inventory write downs and a decrease in inventory purchases in an effort to manage inventory levels  decreases in accounts receivable of million as a result of improved collections and decreases in other assets of million 
this was partially offset by our uses of cash in fiscal  including our net loss of million adjusted for non cash items of million the gain on the sale of smic shares of million  the gain on the sale of nexflash shares of million  equity in net loss of affiliated companies of million  impairment charges for goodwill of million  depreciation and amortization of million  in process research and development charge of million  provision for bad debt of million and other non cash items of million and decreases in accounts payable of million primarily driven by a decrease in inventory purchases in an effort to manage inventory levels and decreases in accrued expenses of million

in fiscal  we generated approximately million from our sale of smic shares resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in fiscal  we made capital expenditures of approximately million for test equipment and engineering tools 
we expect to spend approximately million to million to purchase capital equipment during the next twelve months  principally for the purchase of design and engineering tools  additional test equipment  and computer software and hardware 
we expect to fund our capital expenditures from our existing cash and cash equivalent balances 
we used million for financing activities during fiscal compared to million generated in fiscal we have million available through a number of short term lines of credit with various financial institutions in taiwan 
these lines of credit expire at various times through august as of september   we had outstanding borrowings of approximately million under these short term lines of credit 
our unused short term lines of credit and unused lines of credit for short term notes amounted to approximately million and million  respectively  at september  in fiscal  we used million to pay convertible debentures acquired in the acquisition of icsi and million for the repayment of short term borrowings 
the source of financing for fiscal was borrowings of million under icsi lines of credit  proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million from stock option exercises and sales under our employee stock purchase plan and a decrease in restricted cash of million 
in the three months ended march   we completed a follow on public offering of our common stock whereby we sold  shares at a public offering price of per share 
proceeds from this offering  net of commissions  discounts and expenses  were million 
in addition  in fiscal  we generated million from the issuance of common stock from option exercises and sales under our employee stock purchase plan and used million to secure a letter of credit for the purchase of equipment 

table of contents our headquarters are located in a leased site in santa clara  california 
outside of the us  we have operations in leased sites in china and hong kong 
in addition to these sites  we lease sales offices in the us  europe and asia 
these leases expire at various dates through in taiwan  we own and occupy the icsi building 
the land upon which the icsi building is situated is leased under an operating lease that expires in march our outstanding commitments under these leases are approximately million 
we generally warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of months 
liability for a stated warranty period is usually limited to the replacement of defective items or return of amounts paid 
warranty expense has historically been immaterial to our financial statements 
on january   we announced our intent to acquire the remaining of icsi that we did not then own 
in the nine months ended september   we purchased additional shares of icsi for approximately million  increasing our ownership percentage to approximately at september  we intend to acquire substantially all of the remaining outstanding shares of icsi for cash of approximately million 
our contractual cash obligations at september  are outlined in the table below contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases purchase obligations with wafer foundries non cancelable purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations we believe our existing funds will satisfy our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements through at least the next months 
we may from time to time take actions to further increase our cash position through equity or debt financings  sales of shares of investments  bank borrowings  or the disposition of certain assets 
from time to time  we may also commit to acquisitions or equity investments  including strategic investments in wafer fabrication foundries or assembly and test subcontractors 
to the extent we enter into such transactions  any such transaction could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing to fund such activities 
there can be no assurance that any such additional financing could be obtained on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make difficult and subjective estimates  judgments and assumptions 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience combined with knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future  considering the information available at the time 
actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we reevaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 

table of contents our critical accounting policies which are impacted by our estimates are i the valuation of our inventory  which impacts cost of goods sold and gross profit  ii the valuation of our allowance for sales returns and allowances  which impacts net sales  iii the valuation of our allowance for doubtful accounts  which impacts general and administrative expense  iv accounting for acquisitions and goodwill  which impacts other expense when we record impairments and v the valuation of our non marketable equity securities  which impacts other expense when we record impairments 
each of these policies is described in more detail below 
we also have other key accounting policies that may not require us to make estimates and judgments that are as subjective or difficult  for instance  our policies with regard to revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues on sales to distributors with sales price rebates and product return privileges 
these policies are described in the notes to our financial statements contained elsewhere in this report on form k 
valuation of inventory 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
determining market value requires us to project unit prices and volumes for future periods in which we expect to sell inventory on hand as of the balance sheet date 
as a result of these estimates  we may record a charge to cost of goods sold  which decreases our gross profit  in advance of when the inventory is actually sold to reflect market values that are below our manufacturing and sales commission costs 
conversely  if we sell inventory that has previously been written down to the lower of cost or market at more favorable prices than we had forecasted at the time of the write down  our gross profit may be higher 
in addition to lower of cost or market write downs  we also analyze inventory to determine whether any of it is excess  obsolete or defective 
we write down to zero dollars which is a charge to cost of goods sold the carrying value of inventory on hand in excess of six months historical sales volumes to cover estimated excess and obsolete exposures  unless adjustments are made based on our judgments for newer products  end of life products or planned inventory increases 
in making such judgments to write down inventory  we take into account the product life cycles which can range from six to months  the stage in the life cycle of the product  and the impact of competitors announcements and product introductions on our products 
valuation of allowance for sales returns and allowances 
net sales consist principally of total product sales less estimated sales returns 
to estimate sales returns and allowances  we analyze potential customer specific product application issues  potential quality and reliability issues and historical returns 
we evaluate quarterly the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns and allowances 
this reserve is reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
increases to the reserve are recorded as a reduction to net sales 
because the reserve for sales returns and allowances is based on our judgments and estimates  particularly as to product application  quality and reliability issues  our reserves may not be adequate to cover actual sales returns and other allowances 
if our reserves are not adequate  our net sales could be adversely affected 
valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments for goods and services purchased from us 
we make our estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
once an account is deemed unlikely to be fully collected  we write down the carrying value of the receivable to the estimated recoverable value  which results in a charge to general and administrative expense  which decreases our profitability 
accounting for acquisitions and goodwill 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase accounting method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas   goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this method  the total consideration paid  excluding  if any  the contingent consideration that has not been earned  is allocated over the fair value of the net assets acquired  including in process research and development  with any excess allocated to goodwill 
goodwill is defined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value allocated to the net assets 
our judgments as to fair value of the assets will  therefore  affect the amount of goodwill that we record 
we engage a qualified third party valuation firm that specializes in the valuation of tangible and intangible assets to advise us in the valuation analysis 
the valuation firm will deliver a written analysis of the values assessed 
for tangible assets acquired in any acquisition  such as plant and equipment  the useful lives are estimated by considering comparable lives of similar assets  past 
table of contents history  the intended use of the assets and their condition 
in estimating the useful life of the acquired intangible assets with definite lives  we and our valuation firm consider the industry environment and unique factors relating to each product relative to our business strategy and the likelihood of technological obsolescence 
acquired intangible assets primarily include core and current technology  customer relationships and customer contracts 
we are currently amortizing our acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods generally ranging from six months to six years 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
in fiscal  we recorded charges for impairment of goodwill in the amount of million 
valuation of non marketable securities 
our ability to recover our strategic investments in equity securities that are non marketable and to earn a return on these investments is largely dependent on financial market conditions and the occurrence of liquidity events  such as initial public offerings  mergers or acquisitions  and private equity transactions 
the timing of when any of these events may occur is uncertain and very difficult to predict 
in addition  under our accounting policy  we are required to periodically review all of our investments for impairment 
in the case of non marketable equity securities  this requires significant judgment on our part  including an assessment of the investees financial condition  the existence of subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant equity preferences  as well as the investees historical results of operations and projected results and cash flows 
if the actual outcomes for the investees are significantly different from their forecasts  the carrying value of our non marketable equity securities may be overstated  and we may incur additional charges in future periods  which will decrease our profitability 
in fiscal  we recorded approximately million impairment losses related to two of our non marketable equity securities 
at september   our strategic investments in non marketable securities totaled million 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we currently intend on applying prospective recognition 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab regarding the sec s interpretation of sfas r and the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
we will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments by applying the accounting provisions of apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations due to the amortization of the outstanding unvested share based awards through their vesting period  although it will have no added impact on our cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial market risk includes risks associated with international operations and related foreign currencies 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our consolidated revenue 
our international sales are largely denominated in us dollars and therefore are not subject to material foreign currency exchange risk 
we have operations in china  europe  taiwan  hong kong  india  japan and korea 
expenses of our international operations are denominated in each country s local currency and therefore are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
in the quarter ended september   we recorded exchange losses of approximately million  however  prior to this we had not experienced any significant negative impact on our operations as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not currently engage in any hedging activities 
we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of million at september  excluding million of smic stock included in short term investments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without increasing risk 
we invest primarily in high quality  short term debt instruments such as municipal auction rate certificates and instruments issued by high quality financial institutions and companies  including money market instruments 
a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease in our interest income 
on march   smic completed an initial public offering ipo 
smic s ordinary shares are traded on the hong kong stock exchange and smic american depository receipts adr are traded on the new york stock exchange 
each smic adr represents fifty ordinary shares 
we use the weighted average cost method to determine the cost basis of shares of smic 
in fiscal  we sold shares of smic and recorded gross proceeds of approximately million and a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in fiscal  we sold shares of smic for approximately million  resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
since smic s ipo  the company accounts for its shares in smic under the provisions of fasb and has marked its investment to the market value as of september  by increasing other assets and by increasing accumulated comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet 
the cost basis of the company s shares in smic is approximately million and the market value at september  was approximately 
table of contents million 
the market value of smic shares is subject to fluctuations and the company s carrying value will be subject to adjustments to reflect the current market value 
the company s shares in smic are subject to certain lockup restrictions and therefore are not freely tradable 
these lockup restrictions generally lapse at the rate of of the company s pre offering shares every days following the ipo 
thus all of the company s shares in smic will be freely tradable in february we have investments in equity securities of privately held companies for the promotion of business and strategic objectives of approximately million at september  these investments are generally in companies in the semiconductor industry 
these investments are included in other assets and are accounted for using the equity or cost method 
for investments in which no public market exists  our policy is to review the operating performance  recent financing transactions and cash flow forecasts for such companies in assessing the net realizable values of the securities of these companies 
impairment losses on equity investments are recorded when events and circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired and the decline in value is other than temporary 
in this regard  we recorded approximately million impairment losses on two equity investments in fiscal and a million impairment loss on one of our equity positions in fiscal
