item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview polyone corporation is an international polymer services company with continuing operations in thermoplastic compounds  specialty polymer formulations  color and additive systems and thermoplastic resin distribution 
we also have equity investments in providers of pvc resin and its intermediaries 
headquartered in avon lake  ohio  we have employees at manufacturing sites in north america  europe and asia  and joint ventures in north america  south america and asia 
we provide value to our customers through our ability to link polymer technology and formulation know how with our manufacturing and supply chain processes 
discontinued operations as of december   our specialty resins and engineered films businesses qualified for accounting treatment as discontinued operations 
as a result  all historical financial information of these businesses revenues  costs and expenses  assets and liabilities and cash flows has been reported separately as discontinued operations 
specialty resins and engineered films were previously included in our performance plastics segment 
in august  we sold our elastomers and performance additives business and in december  we sold our interest in softer  an italian compounder of thermoplastic materials 
as a result  all historical financial information of these businesses has also been reported separately as discontinued operations 
the elastomers and performance additives business was previously reported as a separate segment and softer was previously included in the performance plastics segment 
for more information regarding discontinued operations  including a discussion of the facts and circumstances leading to the decisions to divest these businesses  please see note b to our consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and consolidation activities since our formation in  we have undertaken several restructuring initiatives to improve profitability and  as a result  we have incurred various employee separation and plant phaseout costs 
employee separation costs include salary continuation benefits  medical coverage and outplacement assistance and are based upon a formula that takes into account each individual employee s base compensation level and length of service 
we maintain an employee severance plan that provides specific benefits to all employees except those employed under collective bargaining agreements who lose their jobs due to reduction in workforce or job elimination initiatives or from closing manufacturing facilities 
collective bargaining employees are covered under the terms of the specific agreement under which they are employed 
the amount is polyone corporation determined separately for each affected employee and is recognized at the date the employee is notified if the actual termination date will be within days of notification or is accrued on a straight line basis over the period from the notification date to the actual termination date if the termination date is more than days after the notification date 
of the  employees identified during and employees identified in to be terminated  all had been terminated at december  plant phaseout costs include the impairment of buildings  land  manufacturing equipment and office equipment at manufacturing facilities  and the resulting write down of the carrying value of these assets to fair value  which represents our best estimate of the net proceeds to be received for the assets to be sold or scrapped  less cost to sell 
plant phaseout costs also include cash facility closing costs and lease termination costs 
assets transferred to other polyone facilities are transferred at net book value 
plant phaseout costs associated with continuing operations are reflected in the condensed consolidated statement of operations on the line employee separation and plant phaseout 
plant phaseout costs associated with discontinued operations are reflected in the condensed consolidated statement of operations on the line income loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes 
plant phaseout costs for continuing operations relate to the performance plastics segment  and plant phaseout costs for discontinued operations relate to the engineered films business  formerly included in the performance plastics segment  and the elastomers and performance additives business  which was previously reported as a separate segment 
for further information  please refer to note f to the consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  charges 
operating income for includes a million benefit relative to employee separation and plant phaseout costs as a result of adjusting estimated remaining liabilities associated with restructuring initiatives announced in prior years 
income from discontinued operations for the same period was reduced by million on a pre tax basis for employee separation and plant phaseout costs from the announcement in the fourth quarter of and closure in the first quarter of of one of our engineered films manufacturing facilities and two of our elastomers and performance additives manufacturing facilities 
this reduction was partially offset by a gain from the sale of a previously closed elastomers and performance additives manufacturing facility located in tillsonburg  ontario 
we will retain the liabilities for employee separation and plant phaseout costs for the businesses reported as discontinued operations upon the sale of these businesses and  as a result  they are included in this discussion 
all employees who were affected by the restructuring initiatives announced in prior years had been terminated as of december  the remaining employee separation costs accrued at december  totaling million are expected to be paid out through the second quarter of the remaining plant phaseout cash closure costs accrued at december   which primarily represent lease commitments totaling million  are expected to be paid out through the first quarter of charges 
operating income for was reduced by million for employee separation and plant phaseout costs resulting from a january announcement to reduce approximately staff personnel  a june decision to close the fort worth  texas color additives plant  and the adjustment of remaining liabilities associated with restructuring initiatives announced in prior years 
during the third quarter of  we also closed two leased ohio administrative offices and a portion of the mexico distribution business  and reduced manufacturing personnel in the north american plastics businesses 
charges of million were included in discontinued operations resulting primarily from decisions to close an engineered films plant and two elastomers and performance additives plants 
charges 
during  employee separation and plant phaseout charges of million were recorded for costs associated with the consolidation of certain activities related to our formulators operations in the performance plastics segment 
the costs were for employee separation  which consisted of severance and other employee benefits 
all employees affected were terminated in for further detail  see note f to the consolidated financial statements and  for a breakdown of these charges by segment  see note s to the consolidated financial statements 
status of pension plans our pension plans were under funded by a total of million at december  and million at december  funded status as defined in this discussion is computed by subtracting end of year plan assets from the end of year accumulated benefit obligation 
contributing to the improved funded status was a million voluntary pension contribution 
as a result  we expect total pension expense in to be approximately million  approximately million lower than in we also anticipate no minimum funding requirements for the us qualified defined benefit plans in or as a result of this voluntary contribution 
at december   our minimum pension liability for our qualified defined benefit pension plans was million 
this amount is reflected on the line other non current liabilities including pensions in the consolidated balance sheets 
this balance will decrease in future periods if interest rates increase  investment results improve or contributions to these plans cause the pension plans to return to fully funded status 
outlook based on the pace of business at the end of and early  as well as the fact that us industrial production has continued the positive trajectory that began in august  we anticipate that north american market conditions in should remain favorable 
we anticipate strengthening seasonal polyone corporation demand in the first half of compared with the second half of  and we anticipate a recurrence of year over year demand growth during the second half of markets 
despite slowly rising interest rates  housing starts are projected to remain strong 
north american automobile and light truck build rates did slow in late  particularly among the big three domestic manufacturers 
projections are that builds should be similar to building materials and automotive applications represent approximately and  respectively  of our annual sales 
geographies 
our view is that real plastics growth in north america should trend up in in a range of to compared with to per year of average annual growth in the s 
this trend of slower demand growth is principally a result of the loss of manufacturing in north america and the maturation of some larger markets 
in late  europe experienced a slowing in demand  which was attributed to high energy costs and the strong euro 
for polyone  this slowing was most pronounced in germany and france 
our current view is that plastics demand should grow comparable with the level experienced in asian business slowed slightly in late  but expectations are for a robust markets for plastics are expected to grow to  with china pacing the demand at to  including plastics growth approaching in southern china 
we are building a manufacturing facility in southern china in an effort to capture market position and take advantage of the region s particularly strong growth 
margins 
oil and natural gas derived hydrocarbon feedstock pricing is expected to be higher on average in compared with as a result  price trends for key raw materials are expected to continue to pressure margins in in particular  the costs of chlorine  ethylene and pvc resin are projected to increase  pressuring margins in our downstream vinyl compounds and specialty resins businesses 
we experienced a significant increase in raw material costs in late we estimate that our purchased raw material cost increases in could exceed million 
to offset this margin reduction  we continue the effort we began in late to raise product prices  though there can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising prices 
our resin and intermediates segment  on the other hand  should benefit in from the price trends associated with pvc resin  chlorine and caustic soda and  as a result  we expect earnings to increase in this segment over levels 
the resulting pressure on our margins should be offset by the full year benefit of cost reduction and restructuring initiatives  new initiatives in to continue simplifying processes and eliminate non value added work  ongoing raw material savings programs and selling price increases 
market share 
management will focus in on strengthening our market positions 
we are targeting market share gains by helping customers be more competitive on a global basis  expanding our international presence  commercializing new technologies and offering our customers distinct service advantages

accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare financial statements on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under the related facts and circumstances 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments  and have documented the principal underlying assumptions for these estimates and judgments regarding certain amounts included in the financial statements related to the accounting policies and estimates described in the following text 
the application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
for additional information regarding our accounting policies  see note c to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental accrued liability we have accrued million to cover future environmental remediation expenditures  and believe that none of these matters  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flow beyond the amounts accrued 
this accrual represents our best estimate of the remaining probable remediation costs based upon information and technology currently available 
our estimate of this liability may be revised as new regulations or technologies are developed or additional information is obtained 
we increased our reserves in to reflect a reduction in expected recoveries from an insurance company for groundwater remediation costs at a site that we no longer own  and also to recognize an increase over previous cost estimates for a remedial action work plan at an inactive site that required state and federal approval that was received during the third quarter of for additional information regarding our environmental accrued liability  see note o to the consolidated financial statements 
asbestos related claims we have been named in various lawsuits involving multiple claimants and defendants for alleged asbestos exposure in the past by  among others  workers and contractors and their families at plants owned by us or our predecessors or on board ships owned or operated by us or our predecessors 
we have established reserves of approximately million as of polyone corporation december  for asbestos related claims that are probable and estimable 
we believe the probability is remote that losses in excess of the amounts we have accrued could be material to our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
this belief is based upon our ongoing assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the specific claims and our defenses and insurance coverages available with respect to these claims  as well as the probability and expected magnitude of reasonably anticipated future asbestos related claims 
our assessment includes whether the pleadings allege exposure to asbestos  asbestos containing products or premises exposure  the severity of the plaintiffs alleged injuries from exposure to asbestos or asbestos containing products and the length and certainty of exposure on our premises  to the extent disclosed in the pleadings or identified through discovery  whether the named defendant related to us manufactured or sold asbestos containing products  the outcomes of cases recently resolved  and the historical pattern of the number of claims 
if the underlying facts and circumstances change in the future  we will modify our reserves  as appropriate 
restructuring related accruals specific accruals have been recorded in connection with restructuring our businesses  as well as the integration of acquired businesses 
these accruals include estimates principally related to employee separation costs  the closure and or consolidation of facilities  contractual obligations and the valuation of certain assets including property  plant and equipment  and inventories 
actual amounts could differ from the original estimates 
restructuring related accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to plans are appropriately recognized when identified 
changes to plans associated with the restructuring of existing businesses are generally recognized as employee separation and plant phaseout costs in the period the change occurs 
under eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  changes to plans associated with the integration of an acquired business are recognized as an adjustment to the acquired business original purchase price goodwill if recorded within one year of the acquisition 
after one year  a reduction of goodwill is recorded if the actual costs incurred are less than the original reserve 
more than one year subsequent to an acquisition  if the actual costs incurred exceed the original reserve  the excess is recognized as an employee separation and plant phaseout cost

equity investment equity investments are accounted for by the equity method  under which we recognize our proportionate share of each investment s net income or loss in our consolidated statement of operations on the line income from equity affiliates and minority interest  and the carrying cost of each investment on the consolidated balance sheets on the line investment in equity affiliates 
goodwill as of december   we had million of goodwill that resulted from having acquired businesses 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis since prior to  goodwill was amortized to expense 
impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment  or decline in value  may have occurred 
in making these impairment assessments  we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units with that reporting unit s carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is measured and recognized 
we have selected july as our annual impairment testing date 
we use a combination of two valuation methods  a market approach and an income approach  to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
absent fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions  we believe the use of these two methods provides reasonable estimates of a reporting unit s fair value 
fair value computed by these two methods is arrived at using a number of factors  including projected future operating results and business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  marketplace data of comparable companies or near comparable companies from within a consistent industry grouping  and cost of capital 
there are inherent uncertainties  however  related to these factors and to management s judgment in applying them to this analysis 
nonetheless  we believe the combination of these two methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
no assumptions or estimates differed between these two methods as of any valuation date for each reporting unit 
the market approach estimates fair value by applying sales  earnings and cash flow multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar investment characteristics of the reporting unit to the reporting unit s operating performance adjusted for non recurring items 
we believe this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units 
the key estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value under this approach include projected future results and a control premium applied to the market multiples to adjust the enterprise value upward for a ownership interest  where applicable 
projected results for the next months are used due to the forward looking nature of the market related multiples 
projected future results are based upon our best estimates  which take into account projected economic and market conditions and the reporting unit s business plans 
the income approach is based on projected future debt free cash flow that is discounted to present value using discount factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows 
we believe this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit s expected long term oper polyone corporation ating and cash flow performance 
this approach also mitigates most of the impact of cyclical downturns that occur in the reporting unit s industry 
the income approach is based on a reporting unit s five to year projection of operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital calculated for the reporting unit s industry 
the projection is based upon our best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the five to year period including growth rates  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions used for this cash flow model include terminal value growth rates  terminal value margin rates  future capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements based on projected management plans 
during the third quarter of  we completed the required phase one goodwill impairment assessment and determined that goodwill was not impaired as of july  the average fair values of the market approach and income approach exceeded the carrying value by for the plastic compounds and colors reporting unit and by for the formulators reporting unit 
using the lowest fair value determined by these two methods would have resulted in a fair value that exceeded the carrying value by for the plastic compounds and colors reporting unit and by for the formulators reporting unit 
while we determined that there was no additional goodwill impairment as of the annual assessment on july   the future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment  such as a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel or a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of  would require us to perform another assessment prior to the next required annual assessment in these types of events and the resulting analysis could result in future additional charges against earnings to reflect goodwill write offs or other asset impairments 
any future goodwill impairment would not impact our required financial ratios under the receivables sale facility and the revolving credit facility 
however  available borrowings under the revolving credit facility would effectively be reduced by of any after tax impairment write off 
the key assumptions used to prepare the july  valuations under the income approach for the plastic compounds and colors reporting unit were a long term sales growth rate of  working capital to sales ratio of and weighted average cost of capital of 
for the formulators reporting unit  the key assumptions were a long term sales growth rate of  working capital to sales ratio of and weighted average cost of capital of 
the key assumptions used to prepare the july  valuations under the market approach for each reporting unit were multiples of next year projected sales  earnings before interest and taxes ebit and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  adjusted to reflect differences between the reporting units and the comparable companies for effectiveness in asset utilization  total asset return  financial leverage and risk 
for the plastic compounds and colors reporting unit  the key assumptions were a multiple of sales of  a multiple of ebitda of and a multiple of ebit of for the formulators reporting unit  key assumptions were a multiple of sales of  a multiple of ebitda of and a multiple of ebit of we also determined that goodwill was not impaired for the plastic compounds and colors reporting unit and the formulators reporting unit as of the interim assessment performed as of december  and the annual assessment performed as of july  we did  however  recognize impairment charges in and relative to businesses classified as discontinued operations to reduce the net assets of these businesses held for sale to their estimated future net proceeds 
for details regarding these charges  see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes estimates of full year taxable income of the various legal entities and jurisdictions are used in the tax rate calculation  which change throughout the year 
management uses judgment to estimate the income for the year 
because judgment is involved  there is risk that the tax rate may significantly increase or decrease in any period 
in determining income loss for financial statement purposes  we must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income 
in estimating future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and international pre tax income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
as a result  we have computed a valuation allowance of million  and we intend to maintain it until it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in the valuation allowance 
realizing our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon our ability to execute certain feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income including  but not limited to  any future restructuring activities may require that we polyone corporation record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the related period and could have a significant impact on future earnings 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in applying complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based upon our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of recorded reserves  the effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
pensions and post retirement benefits included in our results of operations are significant pension and post retirement benefit costs  which are measured using actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including assumptions about discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
these assumptions are updated at the beginning of each fiscal year 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
changes in pension and post retirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
our net pension and post retirement benefit cost was approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively  excluding the impact of restructuring actions 
the decrease in net pension and post retirement expense during fiscal was primarily a result of better than expected return on pension assets  actuarial experience gains  cessation of medicare part b premium reimbursements provided through the retiree medical plan for certain participants  and recognition of the federal subsidy related to providing prescription drug benefits to medicare eligible retirees under the medicare act 
to develop our discount rate  we considered the available yields on high quality  fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations 
to develop our expected return on plan assets  we considered historical long term asset return experience  the expected investment portfolio mix of plan assets and an estimate of long term investment returns 
to develop our expected portfolio mix of plan assets  we considered the duration of the plan liabilities and gave more weight to equity positions  including both public and private equity investments  than to fixed income securities 
holding all other assumptions constant  a percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the fiscal net pension and post retirement expense by approximately million 
likewise  a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have increased or decreased the fiscal net pension cost by approximately million 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of our pension and post retirement plans 
it is difficult to predict these factors due to highly volatile market conditions 
holding all other assumptions constant  a percentage point decrease or increase in the discount rate would have increased or decreased the minimum pension liability by approximately million as of december  the rate of increase in medical costs assumed for the next five years was held constant with prior years to reflect both actual experience and projected expectations 
the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported 
only certain employees hired prior to december  are eligible to participate in our company s subsidized post retirement plan 
contingencies we are subject to various investigations  claims  and legal and administrative proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of business activities 
any liability that may result from these proceedings  and any liability judged to be probable and estimable  has been accrued 
any potential liability not accrued is not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our future financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
stock options granted to employees on december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r will require all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair value rather than as a pro forma disclosure 
we are required to adopt statement r no later than july  cash flows in millions cash flows provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities discontinued operations individual line items that comprise cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities are set forth in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the discussion below centers upon the main drivers of changes in cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities 
operating activities cash used by operating activities in was million less than in depreciation and amortization in was consistent with levels 
more cash was provided in from improved earnings  lower cash payments required under employee separation and plant phaseout programs and higher distributions of cash received from equity affiliates 
more cash was used in for voluntary contributions to defined benefit voluntary pension plans 
accounts receivable polyone corporation increased in  primarily from increased business activity levels and a decrease of million in the amount of receivables sold under the receivables sale facility  partially offset by improved average collection periods for receivables 
inventory levels were consistent at the end of compared with even though business activity levels were higher  reflecting improved inventory turnover efficiency 
accounts payable increased in primarily from higher business activity levels  with similar average payment periods 
cash used by operating activities in was million greater than in depreciation and amortization in was consistent with levels 
less cash was provided in from lower earnings and lower distributions of cash received from equity affiliates 
more cash was used in from higher cash payments required under employee separation and plant phaseout programs 
accounts receivable levels were consistent at the end of compared with  reflecting consistent collection periods and levels of business activity 
inventory levels declined in primarily from improved inventory turnover efficiency  and accounts payable levels declined primarily from lower average payment periods 
investing activities cash provided by investing activities in was million more than in the primary driver was cash received from the sale of the elastomers and performance additives business in august capital expenditures in both and were primarily in support of current manufacturing operations  and were slightly lower in we also spent less cash in for business acquisitions 
in we purchased the north american distribution business of resindirect llc  which is included in our distribution segment  and in we made the final payment due on our december acquisition of transformacion de pigmentos y colorantes  sa  which is included in our performance plastics segment 
we also received more cash in from the sale of assets 
in we sold our european melos rubber granulates operations  and in we sold our interest in techmer pm  llc 
both businesses were formerly included in our performance plastics segment 
cash used by investing activities in was million less than in the primary driver was lower capital expenditures  which were primarily in support of current manufacturing operations 
we also received more cash in from the sale of assets 
as previously mentioned  we sold our interest in techmer in in  we sold our interest in softer 
financing activities cash used for financing activities in was million more than in  primarily from the net repayment of million of short term and long term debt in  compared with net borrowings of short term and long term debt in totaling million 
borrowings in primarily resulted from the issuance of million of unsecured notes  partially offset by the maturity of million of senior notes 
we also paid million for debt issuance costs in cash provided by financing activities in was million more than in due to higher short and long term debt borrowings in as described above 
in  we issued million of senior notes 
in addition  we paid dividends in no dividends have been paid since discontinued operations cash provided by discontinued operations in was million more than in  primarily from improved earnings which were driven by higher sales and lower costs as a result of restructuring initiatives and by not reflecting depreciation or amortization expense in as required by generally accepted accounting principles as applied to discontinued operations 
cash provided by discontinued operations in was million less than in  primarily from reduced earnings resulting from lower sales levels combined with higher material costs that were not fully recaptured in selling price increases 
capital resources and liquidity as of december   we had existing facilities to access available capital resources receivables sale facility  secured revolving credit facility  uncommitted short term credit lines and senior unsecured notes and debentures totaling approximately million 
as of december   we had utilized million of these facilities  and approximately million was available to be drawn while remaining in compliance with all facilities 
the following table summarizes available and outstanding facilities at december  in millions outstanding available long term debt revolving credit facility receivables sale facility short term bank debt on may   we completed a debt refinancing 
the refinancing provided liquidity and the funds to repay senior debt that matured in september and to support normal operations and fund restructuring initiatives intended to improve earnings 
as part of this comprehensive refinancing  we issued million of unsecured senior notes  entered into a new three year million receivables sale facility and amended and restated the revolving credit facility 
the unsecured senior notes rank equally with all other senior unsecured indebtedness 
proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used to repay the senior notes that matured in september  to pay off the borrowings on the revolving credit facility and to pay down the amounts borrowed under the receivables sale facility 
the new receivables sale facility replaced the former receivables sale facility 
the security that had polyone corporation been extended in february to senior notes and debentures and our guarantee of the sunbelt notes ended as part of the debt refinancing 
security was granted under the terms of the amended and restated revolving credit agreement 
as of december   our secured borrowings were not at levels that would trigger the security on the indentures governing our notes and debentures or our guarantee of the sunbelt notes 
we had guaranteed million of oxyvinyls borrowings from occidental petroleum corporation when oxyvinyls was formed  and this guarantee ended on june  long term debt at december   we had long term debt of million  with maturities ranging from to see note h to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our debt 
current maturities of long term debt at december  were million 
revolving credit facility during the third quarter of  we amended our revolving credit facility to reduce the facility borrowing capacity from million to million to better align facility capacity with our needs for credit following the sale of the elastomers and performance additives business 
also  we would have had limited access to amounts above million without triggering the security provisions of the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes and debentures and our guarantee of the sunbelt notes  as discussed below 
no amendments were made to any financial covenants 
the revolving credit facility has a three year term with an inception date of may  the maximum amount that may be borrowed under the revolving credit facility is limited to of the amount that may be borrowed and secured without triggering the security provisions of the indentures governing the existing senior unsecured notes and debentures and our guarantee of the sunbelt notes 
the revolving credit facility was further amended on september  to limit any additional borrowings under the facility unless  after giving effect to the borrowing  the interest coverage ratio as defined and calculated under the agreement would not be less than and the borrowed debt to adjusted ebitda ratio as defined and calculated under the agreement would not be more than 
the revolving credit facility makes available up to million for the issuance of standby letters of credit 
obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by substantially all of our company s domestic intellectual property and inventory and some of our domestic real property 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility  although the facility served as a back up facility for million of outstanding letters of credit  and for million of loan guarantees related to our colombian equity joint venture 
our revolving credit facility requires us to  among other things  maintain certain interest coverage and borrowed debt to adjusted ebitda earnings ratios 
further  the financing arrangements limit payments for purposes such as capital expenditures  acquisitions and dividends 
on september   the required financial ratios in the financing arrangements were amended 
the following table summarizes the current defined financial covenant ratios for the fourth quarter of and each quarter in under the revolving credit facility borrowed interest coverage debt to adjusted ratio ebitda ratio minimum maximum agreement compliance fourth quarter of first quarter of second quarter of third quarter of fourth quarter of receivables sale facility as a result of the sale of our elastomers and performance additives business in august  we amended our receivables sale facility during the third quarter of to reduce the amount of eligible receivables available to be sold from million to million  as discussed in note j to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  under the terms of our amended receivables sale facility we are allowed to sell accounts receivable and realize proceeds of up to million 
however  the maximum amount of proceeds that may be received is limited to of the amount of eligible domestic accounts receivable sold 
the receivables sale facility also makes available up to million for the issuance of standby letters of credit  of which million was used at december  the receivables sale facility does not contain any credit ratings provision that would allow the purchasers of the accounts receivable to terminate the facility if our senior debt ratings fell below specified levels 
the amount of eligible receivables available to be sold under the receivables sale facility will be impacted by the divestment of any or all of the businesses currently held for sale because each of these businesses has accounts receivable that were sold under the receivables sale facility 
on september   we amended the receivables sale facility to adjust interest coverage ratio requirements 
the interest coverage ratio requirements is to for the first quarter  to for the second quarter  and to thereafter 
of the capital resource facilities available to us as of december   the portion of the receivables sale facility that was actually sold provided security in connection with the transfer of ownership of these receivables 
each indenture governing our senior unsecured notes and debentures and our guarantee of the sunbelt notes allows for a specific level of secured debt  above which security must be provided on each indenture and the guarantee of the sunbelt notes 
the receivables sale facility does not polyone corporation constitute debt under the covenants associated with the senior unsecured notes and debentures 
as of december   no accounts receivable were sold  and we had guaranteed unconsolidated equity affiliate debt of million of sunbelt 
as of december   we sold accounts receivable of million and had guaranteed million of sunbelt debt 
the following table summarizes our obligations under long term debt  operating leases  standby letters of credit  interest obligations  pension and post retirement obligations  guarantees and purchase obligations as of december  payment due by period less than more than in millions total year years years years long term debt operating leases standby letters of credit interest obligations pension and post retirement obligations guarantees purchase obligations total interest obligations are stated at the rate of interest as defined by the debt instrument and take into effect any impact of rate swap agreements  also assuming the debt is paid at maturity 
pension and post retirement obligations relate to our us and international pension and other post retirement plans 
there are no minimum funding requirements for or for the us qualified defined benefit pension plans 
obligations are based on the plans current funded status and actuarial assumptions and include projected benefit payments to participants only through profitable operations in will be important to maintain the existing levels of available capital resources 
expected sources of cash in include net income  borrowings under existing loan agreements and the expected sale of the remaining discontinued operations 
expected uses of cash in include approximately million of long term debt that matures during the year  interest expense and discount on sale of accounts receivable totaling approximately million  cash taxes  spending for previously announced restructuring initiatives in progress as of december  totaling approximately million  and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures are currently estimated between million and million  primarily in support of manufacturing operations 
we may also repurchase or retire additional long term debt in as part of our overall strategy to reduce debt 
percentage changes in the levels of accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable are expected to approximate the corresponding expected percentage increase in sales 
a timing difference between cash contributions to qualified defined benefit pension plans and the expense for these plans is reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
in  cash contributions to qualified defined benefit pension plans totaled approximately million  while the expense for these plans reflected in the consolidated statement of operations totaled approximately million 
our contribution of approximately million to our qualified defined benefit pension plans exceeded the required minimum funding of approximately million 
based on the voluntary payment of million we made during for qualified defined benefit plans  no additional required minimum funding is anticipated in or for the us qualified defined benefit pension plans 
pension contributions are reflected on the line accrued expenses and other in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
based on current projections  we believe that we should be able to continue to manage and control working capital  discretionary spending and capital expenditures  and that cash flow generated from operations  along with the borrowing capacity under the revised revolving credit facility and new receivables sale facility  should be adequate to fund operations and to meet debt service requirements

polyone corporation item a 
quantitative and qualitative information about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
we intend to use such derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
interest rate exposure we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements that convert fixed rate obligations to floating rates 
during july  we terminated all outstanding interest rate swap agreements at a cash cost of million 
we then immediately entered into new interest rate swap agreements on seven fixed rate obligations in the aggregate amount of million 
these exchange agreements are perfectly effective as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
on september   we terminated one of the seven outstanding interest rate swap agreements at a cash cost of million 
at december   the six outstanding agreements had a net fair market value obligation of negative million and the weighted average interest rate for these six agreements was 
at december   these seven agreements had a net fair value obligation of negative million and the weighted average interest rate for these seven agreements was 
at december   there were no interest rate swap agreements in place 
foreign currency exposure we enter into intercompany lending transactions denominated in various foreign currencies and are subject to financial exposure from foreign exchange rate movement between the date a loan is recorded and the date it is settled or revalued 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into foreign exchange contracts 
gains and losses on these contracts generally offset gains or losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged  and are recorded as other income or expense 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes
