item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis  including the critical accounting policies contained herein  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
unless stated otherwise  references to total revenues  revenues and gross profit are before deducting promotional allowances 
overview since acquiring mountaineer park in  mountaineer park has been the focus of our business operations and we expect mountaineer park to continue to account for the majority of our revenues  profits and cash flows for the foreseeable future until binion s  presque isle and north metro are fully operational 
for fiscal  total revenues increased to million from million in  while ebitda grew by to million from million in increased patronage at mountaineer park  a full year of operations of scioto downs acquired july  and payments relating to the joint operating agreement for binion s positively influenced revenues 
increased revenues and operational efficiencies contributed to the increase in ebitda despite the loss of approximately million in marketing grant reimbursements from the west virginia lottery commission and increased costs associated with pursuing the company s development opportunities 
investments in infrastructure and amenities at mountaineer park  which allow us to provide our patrons a higher quality  diversified gaming and entertainment experience  have and will continue to drive growth in our revenues and ebitda 
recently proposed legislation  if enacted and approved by a local voter referendum  would permit mountaineer park to operate table games 
table games would further contribute to mountaineer park s growth and development as a destination resort 
total revenues at mountaineer park increased to million from million in  while ebitda increased to million from million in this growth in revenues is reflective principally of an increase in gaming revenues  while the increase in ebitda is attributable to the revenue growth and operating efficiencies 
revenues from gaming operations at mountaineer park increased to million  generating a net win per day per machine of based on an average of  machines  compared to with an average of  machines in the increase in the net win per day per machine is attributable at least in part to changes in the machine product offerings to meet customer demand and interest 
mountaineer park has received the approval to install up to a total of  machines and will increase the machine count as patron demand dictates 
parimutuel commissions at mountaineer park decreased million to million for this decrease reflects a decline in live and import simulcast revenue of million offset in part by an increase in export simulcast revenue 
the decrease is attributable in part to three fewer race days in and the ability of patrons to place parimutuel wagers via the telephone and the internet where permitted by law 
management believes that the transition to ticket in ticket out machines  ongoing emphasis on machine product offerings to enhance customer interest  continuing efforts to increase the sites receiving mountaineer park s export signal  and enhanced targeted and awareness marketing campaigns to promote mountaineer park as a destination hotel  convention and resort facility will allow this upward trend in revenue growth to continue  but not at levels experienced in recent years 
this growth can be impacted by the passage of legislation allowing table games 
however  this growth can also be impacted by  among other things  the introduction of new competition as a result of gaming legislation in neighboring states and changes in west virginia video lottery legislation 
our business strategy is to leverage our expertise in the gaming and racino markets and capitalize on new development opportunities 
in this regard we have expanded our racing operations to ohio and will be expanding into pennsylvania where we have a license to build a new thoroughbred track  minnesota where we have acquired a interest in an entity that has been granted a license subject to judicial review to build a new harness racetrack in the minneapolis metropolitan area  and other states as opportunities arise 
in the event these states enact new gaming laws  like those in west virginia and now pennsylvania that permit slot machines at racetracks  we would expect our racing facilities in these states to benefit greatly from the addition of slot machines 
on july   we completed the acquisition of scioto downs  inc  which owns and operates a harness horse racing facility with parimutuel wagering in columbus  ohio 
scioto downs contributed revenues of million and million and  incurred an ebitda loss of million and  during and the five months of subsequent to the acquisition date  respectively 
scioto downs has been incorporated into certain mountaineer park simulcasting arrangements 
additionally  we continue to investigate other ways to increase revenues for scioto downs  including telephone and internet wagering  however  nothing definitive has been established at this time 
we have obtained a license to build a new thoroughbred horse racetrack with parimutuel wagering in erie  pennsylvania 
although several alternative sites were identified for the construction of the racetrack and the necessary land acquired  the company has made a determination to utilize the acre site on route in summit township the licensed site 
we anticipate spending over two years between million and million for land acquisition  construction  ff e including slot machines  and license fees  net of anticipated proceeds for sales of the alternate sites and certain tax benefits for presque isle downs 
upon commencement of parimutuel operations at presque isle  we have agreed to purchase an off track wagering facility from penn national gaming for million 
we expect to finance the majority of these development costs with cash flow from operations  cash on hand  availability under our million third amended and restated revolving credit facility and  when slot machines are installed  capital lease obligations 
in light of the cash used for the binion s transaction  depending upon our actual expenditures for presque isle downs and the timing of the license fee payment and any other acquisition activity  we might require additional financing in order to implement all of our development plans 
we plan to build the new horse racetrack and commence operations as soon as practicable  subject to i the ability to obtain clear title to the property to which our license relates and which we currently have under option  and ii other construction related risks 
see item business certain risks related to our business 
in june we acquired a interest in a joint venture north metro that has obtained a license to construct and operate a harness racetrack in minnesota 
the purchase agreement calls for the company to invest up to million 
north metro has been granted a license but such license is subject to judicial review that is pending 
the company has contributed approximately  to north metro through february the speedway property generated revenues of million in or an increase of million from ebitda increased to million in as compared to million in gaming revenues increased approximately million due to new product offerings and increases were also noted in food and beverage and lodging 
an automated player tracking system was implemented at the property in that is expected to enable the speedway property to enhance its competitiveness with other local casinos

ebitda has been presented as a supplemental disclosure because it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry 
uses of cash flows that are not reflected in ebitda include capital expenditures which are significant given the company s expansion  interest payments  income taxes  and debt principal repayments 
moreover  other companies that provide ebitda information may calculate ebitda differently than the company

these guaranteed payments ended on march   effective with the takeover of the operations of the property by the company 
it is anticipated that the operations of binion s will generate revenues in excess of million in promotional allowances during the year decreased by million to million in from million in  a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the costs of the frequent player club program at mountaineer park 
the company s total costs of revenues during the year increased by million to million in from million in  an increase of 
costs of revenues and gross profit before promotional allowances earned from operations for the years ended december were as follows costs of revenues gaming   parimutuel commissions   food  beverage and lodging   other   total costs of revenues   gross profit gaming   parimutuel commissions   food  beverage and lodging   other   gross profit before promotional allowances   less promotional allowances   total gross profit   mountaineer park s total costs of revenues increased by million  or  to million during from million during the the costs of gaming at mountaineer park accounted for million of the increase  having increased to million in from million in the costs of parimutuel commissions increased by million to million in the sources of the remaining costs for were million from food  beverage and lodging and million from other sources

the speedway property incurred million in total costs of revenues during  which was a decrease of million  or  from total costs of revenues of million during the costs of gaming at the speedway property for were million  which was consistent with the remaining costs of revenues of million were primarily incurred by food  beverage and lodging for gaming operations total revenues from gaming operations increased by  or million  to million in from million in mountaineer park had gaming revenues of million for compared to million for  which represents an increase of million  or 
management attributes the increase to the following factors the increase in machine count at mountaineer park from an average of  during to an average of  during  new game themes and changes to product mix to meet changing patron interest and demand  and marketing and promotional campaigns 
gaming revenues for mountaineer park  detailing gross wagers less patron payouts net win  for the years ended december were as follows total gross wagers   less patron payouts   revenues gaming   average number of video lottery terminals   average daily net win per terminal mountaineer park s facility wide average daily net win per terminal increased by to for compared to for during  the average daily net win per terminal was for coin drop machines and for ticket terminals 
the average daily net win per terminal for the lodge based terminals was compared to for track based gaming machines  which includes for non racing days 
track based gaming rooms are closed on non racing days and are only open to patrons during limited hours on racing days 
management will continue its efforts to expand mountaineer park s geographical reach by marketing the facility as a destination resort and convention complex 
however  increased fuel costs  economic conditions and the proliferation of local limited video lottery gaming parlors may impact mountaineer park s revenue growth in additionally  the enactment of gaming legislation in pennsylvania may impact growth in and thereafter depending upon the location of gaming facilities and number of slot machines in pennsylvania 
management also believes  however  that if west virginia were to enact proposed legislation for table games at the state s racetracks  mountaineer park would increase its market penetration and sustain the upward trend in gaming revenues  notwithstanding new competition from pennsylvania 
the speedway property had gaming revenues of million for compared to million for this increase was attributable to new gaming product offerings 
total costs of gaming operations increased by million  or  to million for from million for this increase in costs primarily relates to mountaineer park s gaming operations 
mountaineer park s costs of gaming were million for compared to million for  which represents an increase of million  or 
this change corresponds to the increase in gaming revenues for this property and reflects an increase of million in statutory taxes and assessments  which includes approximately million net of mountaineer park s share of capital reinvestment funds which was the result of generating excess net terminal income  and thus triggering the surcharge and higher tax rate  one month earlier in than in in addition  statutory taxes and assessments also reflects a decrease in such taxes and assessments of million as a result of the effect of an adjustment by the west virginia lottery commission to prior period prizes paid  the majority of which was recorded in prior periods without the benefit of the reductions in statutory taxes 
the overall increase of statutory taxes and assessments was offset in part by decreases in other operating costs  primarily related to salaries  wages and employee benefits 
included in costs of gaming is mountaineer park s obligation to make payments to funds administered by the state of west virginia lottery commission for certain statutory taxes and assessments 
these statutory taxes and assessments are based on percentages of gaming revenues  after the payment of a state administrative fee of  as follows net terminal income state of west virginia hancock county horseman s association racing purses other tourism  employee pension  stakes races  misc 
total statutory payments excludes a administrative fee charged by the state of west virginia lottery commission based on gaming revenues 
the rates above are applied to gaming revenues net of the administrative fee 
the portion of each racetrack s net win  as calculated on the basis of the state s june fiscal year  which exceeded that racetrack s total net win for the twelve months ended june   is referred to as excess net terminal income 
the excess net terminal income is subject to an additional surcharge  after deducting the administrative fee  and a higher tax rate 
for mountaineer park  the baseline or threshold for excess net terminal income is fixed at approximately million 
excess net terminal income is distributed as follows excess net terminal income state of west virginia hancock county horseman s association racing purses other tourism  employee pension  stakes races  misc 
total statutory payments excludes a administrative fee charged by the state of west virginia lottery commission based on gaming revenues  as well as an additional surcharge once certain levels of gaming revenues are achieved 
the rates above are applied to gaming revenues net of the administrative fee and the surcharge 
the reduction in the net win percentage or conversely the increase in the statutory payments applicable to excess net terminal income is reflected by the company as a cost of gaming during the period that the company generates the excess net terminal income 
mountaineer park exceeded the threshold for excess net terminal income in late february versus late march in accordingly  mountaineer park s effective rate of video lottery tax for was higher than in west virginia s video lottery statute also provides for a capital reinvestment fund for each racetrack into which the state contributes of the surcharge attributable to each racetrack 
generally  for each dollar a racetrack expends on qualifying capital improvements for the racetrack  the racetrack receives a dollar from the capital reinvestment fund 
depending upon the cost of a project  any amount expended in excess of the balance in the capital reinvestment fund may be carried forward three subsequent years 
the company recognizes amounts due from the capital reinvestment fund as the qualifying expenditures are incurred 
during and  mountaineer park received million and million from the capital reinvestment fund  respectively 
as of december   there are no amounts due from the fund 
on march   the west virginia legislature passed sb  which  among other things  redeployed to other state purposes a portion of the video lottery proceeds then on deposit that had been reserved for the state s tourism promotion fund  from which mountaineer park had been obtaining reimbursement for of the cost of qualifying advertisements 
the tourism board froze advertising grants during the second quarter of while it made administrative changes to implement the change in law 
effective july   the percentage of video lottery revenue dedicated to the tourism promotion fund was reduced from to  and the remaining was redistributed to miscellaneous state projects 
these changes did not impact gaming revenues retained by the company  but have and may continue to have an impact on operating income through reduced advertising grants 
the statutory taxes and assessments paid to these funds are included in costs of gaming in the consolidated statements of operations 
these costs  including the state administrative fee and mountaineer park s share of capital reinvestment funds  for the years ended december were as follows employees pension fund   horsemen s purse fund   subtotal   state of west virginia   tourism promotion fund   hancock county   stakes races   miscellaneous state projects   parimutuel commissions parimutuel commissions is a predetermined percentage of the total amount wagered wagering handle  with a higher commission earned on a more exotic wager  such as a trifecta  than on a single horse wager  such as a win  place or show 
in parimutuel wagering  patrons bet against each other rather than against the operator of the facility or with pre set odds 
the total wagering handle is composed of the amounts wagered by each individual according to the wagering activity 
the total amounts wagered form a pool of funds  from which winnings are paid based on odds determined solely by the wagering activity 
the racetrack acts as a stakeholder for the wagering patrons and deducts a take out or gross commission from the amounts wagered  from which the racetrack pays state and county taxes and racing purses 
the company s parimutuel commission rates are fixed as a percentage of the total wagering handle or total amounts wagered 
total revenues from parimutuel commissions increased by  or million  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to incremental revenues earned from scioto downs  which was acquired on july  parimutuel commissions from scioto downs were million during  after the deductions for purses and parimutuel taxes 
scioto downs live racing season runs from may to september and simulcasting operates year round 
mountaineer park had parimutuel commissions of million for compared to million for which represents a decrease of million  or 
parimutuel commissions for mountaineer park  detailing gross handles less patron payouts and deductions  for the years ended december were as follows import simulcast racing parimutuel handle   live racing parimutuel handle   less patrons winning tickets   revenues export simulcast   less state and county parimutuel tax   purses and horsemen s association   revenues parimutuel commissions   the decrease in mountaineer park s parimutuel commissions can be attributed to a decline in live and import simulcast revenue  offset in part by an increase in export simulcast revenue 
the decline in live and import simulcast racing handle and related parimutuel commissions reflects three fewer race days in and decreased attendance that is primarily attributable to the ability of patrons to place parimutuel wagers via telephone and the internet where permitted by law 
the increase in the export simulcast revenue is attributable to increased interest in mountaineer park s racing product and an increase in the number of export sites 
as of december   the number of export simulcast sites increased to as compared to as of december  mountaineer park currently exports to simulcast sites 
management remains optimistic that mountaineer park s export simulcast business may continue to grow as the company is able to add new outlets  but not at the levels achieved in prior years  because growth through prior periods exceeded expectations and state laws limit the number of available outlets 
live racing and import simulcast are expected to continue to be impacted by the conversion of some live racing patrons to export simulcast patrons whether through traditional off track wagering facilities or growth in the utilization of telephone and or internet wagering 
total costs of parimutuel commissions include the salaries  wages and benefits of racing personnel and other racing related operating costs 
the costs of parimutuel commissions increased by million  or  to million for from million for this increase was primarily due to incremental costs incurred by scioto downs 
costs of parimutuel commissions from scioto downs were million during food  beverage and lodging operations total revenues from food  beverage and lodging operations increased by  or million  to million in from million in food and beverage revenues increased to million for compared to million for this increase was primarily due to incremental revenues of million earned from scioto downs  which was acquired on july  mountaineer park had food and beverage revenues of million in compared to million in this increase resulted from increased patron traffic and expansion and remodeling of the gatsby restaurant that was completed and reopened in may at the speedway property  food and beverage revenues increased slightly to million during lodging revenues increased to million for compared to million for mountaineer park and the speedway property had lodging revenues of million and million  respectively  during the average daily room rate for the grande hotel at mountaineer park decreased to during from during  but the average occupancy rate increased to during from during the average occupancy and daily room rates reflect mid week promotional programs offered to gaming patrons during total costs of food  beverage and lodging increased by million  or  to million in from million in food and beverage costs increased to million for compared to million for this increase was primarily due to incremental costs of million incurred by scioto downs

the guaranteed payments received under the joint operating agreement with harrah s ended march   effective with the company taking over the operations of binion s 
costs of other revenues increased by million  or  to million for from million for this increase was partially due to incremental costs of million incurred by scioto downs  which was acquired on july  mountaineer park s costs of other revenues were million in compared to million in specifically  costs incurred for entertainment events held at mountaineer park and expenses incurred for commission revenues in increased by million and million  respectively  compared to marketing and promotions expense marketing and promotions expense increased by million  or  to million for from million for marketing and promotions expense as a percentage of total revenues increased to during compared to during mountaineer park incurred marketing and promotions expense of million for compared to million for the increase in expense was primarily due to mountaineer park only recognizing an aggregate of million of advertising grant reimbursements from the state of west virginia during compared to million during the decline in the grant reimbursement is attributable to a freeze on grant reimbursements during the second quarter of  a more restrictive application of the reimbursement provisions and the pending resolution of other matters relating to the grant program 
in addition  increases in salaries  wages and employee benefits of million in contributed to the overall increase in marketing and promotions expense  which was partially offset by decreased advertising and promotion expenditures of million

in july of  we terminated gaming operations at the reno property 
no gaming revenues were generated at the reno property in or the nevada properties remaining revenues for were million from lodging a million decrease from and million from food and beverage 
the declines are principally attributable to the sale of the reno property that was completed in march scioto downs contributed revenues of million during the five months of subsequent to the acquisition date

of the increase in the cost of food  beverage and lodging  million can be attributed to the expanded operations at mountaineer park and million relating to the addition of scioto downs  which was offset by a decline in the cost of food  beverage and lodging at the nevada properties due to the sale of the reno property 
the costs of other revenue decreased by million in to million 
the decrease is due primarily to the reduction of the number of entertainment events and the corresponding reduction in entertainment costs

results for reflect a full year of operating the hotel that opened in the second quarter of  expanded dining facilities and the additional amenities  as well as the integration of the hotel and convention center business 
gaming operations revenues from gaming operations increased from million in to million in management attributes this increase to the following factors the increase in machine count from an average of  during to an average of  during  new game themes and equipment to meet changing patron interest and demand  increases in patronage driven by new amenities and convention business as mountaineer park becomes a destination resort  awareness marketing and promotional campaigns and programs  and increased bus programming 
for  the average net win per day for coin drop machines at mountaineer park was  and for ticket terminals 
for the same period  average daily net win for the track based gaming machines was per machine including for non racing days when those gaming rooms were closed  compared to earned on the hotel based terminals for a facility wide average of per machine per day 
management believes that the apparent decrease in the average net win per machine day from in to in reflected the absorption of a increase in average machine count 
because of the increase in average number of gaming machines that were installed to address peak demand times on weekends and holidays  management does not view the decrease in daily net win per machine as a negative trend in slot revenue 
to the contrary  management is encouraged by the increase in slot revenue 
gaming revenues net win at mountaineer park for the years ended december were as follows total gross wagers   less patron payouts   revenues gaming   average daily net win per terminal the speedway property had gaming revenues of million for  a decrease of  or  over costs of gaming revenue for increased by million  or  from million to million compared to costs of gaming revenue at mountaineer park increased by million  or  to million in  reflecting an increase of million in statutory expenses directly related to the increase in gaming revenues net of the company s share of capital reinvestment funds  including an increase of million in statutory payments  or increased gaming taxes resulting from the company exceeding the rate change threshold earlier in than in the costs of gaming at the speedway property in of million remained at the same level as in  but increased as a percentage of gaming revenues as a result of a decrease in gaming revenues of million 
the statutory taxes and assessments paid to funds administered by the state of west virginia lottery commission  as previously discussed in management s discussion and analysis of the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   are included in costs of gaming in the consolidated statements of operations

the increase in purses and horsemen s association amounts is attributable principally to the horsemen s share of the increase in export simulcasting revenues 
scioto downs contributed total revenues for parimutuel commissions for from the date of the acquisition of million

total costs of parimutuel operations of million for increased by million compared to the expansion of operations to include scioto downs resulted in an increase in operating costs of million from the date of the acquisition

in april and march  the company purchased parcels aggregating approximately acres of the licensed site for a total of approximately million and expects to acquire the remaining parcel in march for approximately  an additional million is payable in connection with previously acquired parcels when the company commences gaming operations at presque isle downs 
apart from land acquisition costs  closing costs  costs for gaming equipment and the million licensing fee  we anticipate spending between million and million to build presque isle downs including the temporary gaming facility  without giving effect to anticipated proceeds from the sale of the alternative sites or any tax incentives 
upon commencement of parimutuel operations at presque isle downs  we have agreed to purchase an off track wagering facility from penn national gaming for million 
we expect to finance the majority of these development costs with cash flow from operations  cash on hand availability under our million third amended and restated revolving credit agreement and  when slot machines are installed  capital lease obligations 
depending upon our actual expenditures for presque isle downs  the timing of the payment of the licensing fee and the timing of any other acquisition activity  we might require additional financing in order to implement all of our development plans 
commencement of racing and parimutuel operations in erie remains subject to risks and uncertainties  which include but are not limited to closing on the real property for the site  which is currently under option  unforeseen title  engineering  environmental  or geological problems  work stoppages  weather interference  including floods  construction delays and other risks associated with building a racing operation  and compliance with the terms of the license concerning timing the company also identified alternative sites for the construction of presque isle downs that were not available when the company applied for the license 
on march   the company entered into an agreement whereby the company advanced million to a third party for the purpose of acquiring certain real property in erie county  pennsylvania known as the green shingle site as one of alternative sites for the proposed racetrack 
the loan agreement matures on the earliest of march   the date on which the company exercises its option to purchase the property for one dollar plus the cancellation of the indebtedness  or the date on which the borrower puts the property to the company in lieu of the debt

the company has recently made the decision to construct presque isle downs on the route site and is currently investigating and evaluating sale and other development opportunities for the alternative sites 
in connection with the acquisition of the international paper site the company entered into a consent order with the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep regarding a proposed clean up plan for the site 
the proposed clean up plan was based upon a baseline environmental report and it was estimated that such clean up would cost approximately million 
environmental insurance was purchased for environmental matters not addressed in the baseline environmental report 
it was contemplated that if the international paper site was determined to to be the site for construction of the racetrack  that such clean up efforts would have been integrated into the cost of construction of the track 
however  since the company has made the decision not to use this site for the racetrack and will ultimately list this property for sale or propose other development  the company has entered into discussions with the pennsylvania dep to modify the consent order 
in this regard the company has retained an environmental consultant to conduct an environmental risk assessment of the property to determine the most effective and efficient way to address the required clean up of this property 
it is anticipated that the risk assessment approach will reduce the estimated cost associated with the clean up 
however  the company has not finalized the discussions with the padep or completed the risk assessment analysis 
accordingly  a revised estimate of the clean up costs cannot be determined at this time

these commitments and contingencies are discussed in greater detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the company believes that its cash balances  cash generated from operations and available lines of credit will be sufficient to meet all of our currently anticipated commitments and contingencies 
however  the timing of presque isle downs related construction and other expenditures and the timing of other acquisition and development projects may impact our cash flow requirements 
management believes that except as set forth above  our cash balances  cash flow from operations  and available lines of credit will be sufficient to cover any capital required to fund maturing debt obligations and any other contemplated capital expenditures and short term funding requirements for the next twelve months 
see the section entitled business risks related to our business for a description of certain circumstances that may affect our sources of liquidity 
we may also repurchase our common stock in amounts and at times determined by our board of directors from time to time 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may also finance our expansion  to the extent permitted under existing debt agreements  through the public or private sale of additional debt or equity securities 
we cannot provide assurance that additional financing needs  if any  will be available to the company  or if available  the terms of such financing will be on terms favorable to the company 
we also cannot assure you that estimates of our liquidity needs are accurate or that new business developments or other unforeseen events will not occur  resulting in the need to raise additional funds 
our level of indebtedness presents other risks to investors  including the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness when due  and that we may not be able to meet tests and covenants of such debt agreements and achieve satisfactory resolution of such non compliance with the lenders 
in such an event  the holders of our indebtedness may be able to declare all indebtedness owing to them to be due and payable immediately  and proceed against any collateral securing such indebtedness 
these actions could limit our ability to borrow additional funds and would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
a debt rating downgrade would not impact the terms of borrowings under our expected third amended and restated credit facility or the senior notes 
however  a debt rating downgrade could impact the terms of and our ability to obtain additional new financing 
additionally  changes in the regulatory environment or restriction on or prohibition of our gaming or racing operations  whether arising out of legislation or litigation  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
see section entitled business risks related to our business and note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
regulation and taxes the company is subject to extensive regulation by the state of west virginia racing and lottery commissions  nevada gaming authorities  pennsylvania racing commission and ohio racing commission 
change in applicable laws or regulations could have a significant impact on our operations 
taxation the gaming industry represents a significant source of tax revenues  particularly to the states of west virginia and nevada and their counties and municipalities 
we pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations 
from time to time  federal  state and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  affecting the gaming and racing industry 
changes in the tax laws or administration of those laws  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
however  it is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws 
the company believes that recorded tax balances are adequate 
outstanding options on may   the company s board of directors  subject to the approval of the company s shareholders  approved the company s stock incentive plan the plan and reserved  shares of the company s common stock for issuance pursuant to the exercise of options issued under the plan 
the company s shareholders subsequently ratified the plan on july  no options have been granted under the plan

on february   pursuant to a november  employment agreement and the employee stock incentive plan  the company granted to the general manager of one of its properties  a non qualified option to purchase  shares of the company s common stock for per share  the market price on the date of grant 
as of march   there were outstanding options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock 
if all such options and warrants were exercised  the company would receive proceeds of approximately million 
we utilize the treasury stock method in determining the dilutive effect of outstanding options and warrants 
our policy is as follows our basic earnings per share eps is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighed average number of common shares outstanding during the year 
diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock options  warrants  and other convertible securities utilizing the treasury stock method 
diluted earnings per share is calculated by using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the potentially dilutive effect of these occurrences 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are included in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
these policies  along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by our management in their application  have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition video lottery and parimutuel revenues are recognized at the time the wagers are made and are net of winning payouts to patrons 
the distributions from these revenues are governed by the west virginia lottery commission and the west virginia racing commission 
after deduction of a administrative fee paid to the west virginia lottery commission  mountaineer park receives of the first million of video lottery net win per year  based upon west virginia s fiscal year of july june net win in excess of the threshold  which is fixed by statute  is subject to a surcharge 
after reduction for the administrative fee and the surcharge  the net win percentage to be received by the company is 
we recognize the reduction in revenue occasioned by the surcharge and the reduction in the percentage of net win allocable to us during the period in which the net win exceeds the predetermined threshold 
accounting for the change in the net win percentage to be retained by the company in this manner ensures that revenue is being recognized when all services have been rendered and the amount is fixed or determinable 
the amended lottery act also creates a separate capital reinvestment fund for each racetrack to which the state will contribute of the surcharge attributable to each racetrack 
generally  for each dollar a racetrack expends on eligible capital improvements for the racetrack and adjacent property  the track will receive a dollar from the capital reinvestment fund 
depending upon the amount of a project  any amount expended in excess of the balance in the capital reinvestment fund may be carried forward three subsequent years 
we recognize amounts due from the capital reinvestment fund as qualifying capital expenditures are identified 
revenues from food and beverage are recognized at the time of sale and revenues from lodging are recognized on the date of stay 
other revenues are recorded at the time the services are rendered or sales are completed 
lodging  food and beverage gratuitously provided to customers are not recognized as revenues 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles we review the carrying value of our long lived assets including goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable annually effective in for goodwill 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
fair value can be estimated utilizing a number of techniques including quoted market prices  prices for comparable assets  or other valuation processes involving estimates of cash flows  multiples of earnings or revenues 
during  the company performed the annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
as a result of these tests  it was determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
self insurance effective october  we began self insuring for employee health coverage 
self insurance reserves are estimated based upon our prior claims experience 
changes in the number of employees  claims expense and health care costs could cause this liability to fluctuate 
we also maintain stop loss insurance coverage for employee health care claims 
frequent players program at mountaineer members of mountaineer s frequent players program can accumulate points for wagering and other purchases that can be redeemed for tokens  lodging  food and beverage and merchandise 
based upon historical redemptions of frequent player program points  we estimate unredeemed points and record a corresponding liability 
changes in the program  increases in membership and changes in the redemption patterns of our participating patrons could cause this liability to fluctuate 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the bases used for financial reporting and income tax reporting of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have not provided for a valuation allowance at december  because we feel that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future operations 
newly issued accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
the company expects to adopt statement r on july  see note to the consolidated financial statements recently issued accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our variable rate long term debt arrangements 
under our current policies  we have utilized interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes for a portion of our debt arrangements 
however  with the issuance of the fixed rate long term senior notes and repayment of the balance outstanding under the second amended and restated credit agreement in march  our exposure to interest rate changes will be limited to amounts which may be outstanding under the expected million third amended and restated credit agreement see liquidity and sources of capital 
the interest rate derivative entered into in october expired on december  depending upon the amounts outstanding under the third amended and restated credit agreement and without consideration of interest rate derivatives designated as hedges if any  a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would result in an annual interest expense change of up to approximately  at december  the fair value of credit facilities approximates the carrying value except for the senior unsecured notes for which the fair value as determined based upon market quotes is  the carrying value of the senior unsecured notes is  at december
