item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we provide best practices research and analysis across the health care industry 
best practices research identifies  analyzes and describes specific management initiatives  processes and strategies that have been determined to produce the best results in solving common business problems or challenges 
members of each program are typically charged a fixed annual fee and have access to an integrated set of services  including best practices research studies  executive education seminars  customized research briefs and web based access to the program s content database and decision support tools 
our membership business model allows us to focus on issues relevant to a broad audience of health care organizations  while promoting frequent use of our programs and services by our members 
this facilitates growth through cross sell opportunities to existing members and the development of new programs 
our revenues grew in fiscal over fiscal  and grew in fiscal over fiscal we also increased our contract value by at march  over march   and by at march  over march  we define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributed to all membership agreements in effect at a given point in time  without regard to the initial term or remaining duration of any such agreement 
our member renewal rate in each of the past four years has equaled or exceeded 
memberships in each of our best practices research programs are renewable at the end of their one year membership contracts 
our seven other best practices programs provide installation support 
these program memberships help participants accelerate the adoption of best practices profiled in our research studies  and are therefore not individually renewable 
renewable programs generated more than of our revenues in fiscal  with the balance of our revenues generated by installation support programs 
costs associated with a new program initially increase more rapidly than revenues following introduction of the program because revenues associated with the new program are recognized ratably over the membership year while costs are expensed as incurred 
because we offer a standardized set of services  however  our program cost structure is relatively fixed and the incremental cost to serve an additional member is low 
in fiscal  our income from operations was million  compared to million in fiscal our operating costs and expenses consist of cost of services  member relations and marketing  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and stock option related expenses 
cost of services represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services 
member relations and marketing expenses include the costs of acquiring new members and renewing existing members 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of human resources and recruiting  finance and accounting  management information systems  facilities management  new program development and other administrative functions 
depreciation expense includes the cost of depreciation of our property and equipment 
stock option related expenses includes additional payroll taxes for compensation expense as a result of the taxable income employees recognized upon the exercise of common stock options 
in addition  in fiscal  we incurred special compensation charges of  with respect to arrangements entered into prior to our initial public offering

total revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased to million in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to the introduction and expansion of new programs and cross selling existing programs to existing members 
to a lesser degree  our revenue growth was also driven by sales to new member organizations and price increases 
we offered membership programs as of march   as of march  and as of march  our contract value increased from million at march  to million at march   and increased to million at march  our average contract value per member increased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal  and increased to  for fiscal we define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributed to all membership agreements in effect at a given point in time  without regard to the initial term or remaining duration of any such agreement 
cost of services 
cost of services increased from million  in fiscal  to million  in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal the increase in cost of services is primarily due to increased staffing and other costs associated with the development and delivery of our program content and tools 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of services has remained relatively constant at  and for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
costs associated with a new program initially increase more rapidly than revenues following introduction of the program because revenues associated with the new program are recognized ratably over the membership year while costs are expensed as incurred 
because we offer a standardized set of services  our program cost structure is relatively fixed and the incremental cost to serve an additional member is low 
consequently  while cost of services increased since fiscal  it has remained constant as a percentage of revenues 
member relations and marketing 
member relations and marketing expense increased from million or of revenues in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  and increased to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in member relations and marketing expense was primarily due to an increase in sales staff and related costs associated with the introduction of new programs  as well as an increase in member relations personnel and related costs to serve the expanding membership base 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased from million  or of revenues  in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  and increased to million  or of revenues  in fiscal with the development of new programs and the expansion of several administrative functions to support overall organizational growth 
the decrease as a percent of revenues in fiscal reflects the leveraging of resources across our larger revenue base and the increased investment in recruiting and hiring efforts in the member relations and new product development areas that took place across fiscal general and administrative expense includes approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  of net charges from atlantic media company for expenses related to management services  shared space and facilities and certain administrative functions 
we believe these charges approximate the expense which would have been incurred had we provided the equivalent services internally 
see note to our financial statements for a detailed description of our arrangements with atlantic media company 
depreciation 
depreciation expense decreased from million  or of revenues in fiscal  to million  or of revenues in fiscal  and increased to million  or of revenues in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to lower capital expenditures in fiscal and fiscal as compared to prior years 
the increase in fiscal is related to additional depreciation on the build out of our new headquarters facility

special compensation and stock option related expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and decreased to million in fiscal in fiscal  and  we recognized approximately  million and million  respectively  in compensation expense reflecting additional federal insurance corporation act fica taxes as a result of the taxable income that employees recognized upon the exercise of common stock options 
in fiscal  we incurred additional charges of  with respect to special compensation arrangements we entered into as a private company

see note to our financial statements for a detailed description of these arrangements 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the growth was principally from income associated with the increased levels of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased as a result of cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from financing activities as further discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate increased from to primarily due to new legislation enacted in october that disallows certain washington  dc tax deductions  as well as adjustments made to certain deferred tax assets to agree to our recently filed income tax returns 
we intend to file our washington  dc income tax return as a qualified high technology company 
if approved  our washington  dc income tax rate would be reduced to and we would incur a noncash charge to earnings of approximately million  representing the impact on our existing deferred tax asset of lowering the washington  dc income tax rate 
for further information please see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities 
program memberships are generally payable by members at the beginning of the contract term 
the combination of revenue growth and advance payment of memberships typically results in operating activities generating net positive cash flows on an annual basis 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at march  we expect that these funds and expected net positive cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital  financing activities and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months

the facilities accommodate research  delivery  marketing and sales  information technology  administration  graphic services and operations personnel

we are also obligated to take additional expansion space in the building pursuant to the lease 
we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and that additional facilities are available for lease to meet any future needs 
we have entered into a million letter of credit agreement with a commercial bank which expires october   to provide a security deposit for our new office lease 
we pledged certain assets as collateral under the letter of credit agreement 
to date  no amounts have been drawn on this agreement 
the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at march  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
these obligations are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period in thousands total yrs non cancelable operating leases facilities services contract total off balance sheet arrangements at march  and  we have no off balance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for purposes of facilitating off balance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes

the authorized amount was increased by our board to million in october repurchases will be made from time to time in open market and privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions 
no minimum number of shares has been fixed 
we will fund our share repurchases with cash on hand and cash generated from operations

we recognized approximately  million and million in compensation expense reflecting additional federal insurance corporation act taxes as a result of the taxable income that employees recognized upon the exercise of non qualified common stock options in fiscal  and  respectively 
we also incurred additional compensation expense for tax reporting purposes  but not for financial reporting purposes  that increased the deferred tax asset to reflect allowable tax deductions that will be realized in the determination of our income tax liability and therefore reduce our future income tax payments 
in connection with these transactions  our deferred tax asset increased by approximately million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
although the provision for income taxes for financial reporting purposes did not change  our actual cash payments will be reduced as the deferred tax asset is utilized 
significant related party transactions lease and sublease agreements in fiscal we assigned our office lease to atlantic media company formerly dgb enterprises  inc  an entity created in by our founder  david g

administrative services in july  we entered into an administrative services agreement whereby atlantic media company provided us with services related to the facilities associated with our shared leased space  and we provided atlantic media company with certain administrative services 
fees for the services were based on direct costs per transaction  square footage  headcount or a fixed cost per month that approximated the cost for each entity to internally provide or externally source these services 
we believe these charges approximated the costs which would have been incurred had we operated on a stand alone basis 
we incurred net charges under the agreement of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
summary of critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and may require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our members and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies include use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition revenues from renewable research memberships and best practices installation support memberships are recognized over the term of the related subscription agreement  which is generally months 
fees are generally billable  and the full amount of program agreement fees receivable and related deferred revenue are recorded  when a letter agreement is signed by the member 
certain fees are billed on an installment basis 
members may request a refund of their fees  which is provided on a pro rata basis relative to the length of the service period 
as of march   and  approximately million  million and million  respectively  of deferred revenues were to be recognized beyond the following months 
allowance for uncollectible revenue our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our members has an effect on our operating performance and cash flows 
this effect is mitigated because memberships  which are predominantly annual contracts  are generally payable by members at the beginning of the contract term 
we record an allowance for uncollectible revenue as a reduction of revenue based on our ongoing monitoring of our members credit and the aging of receivables 
deferred incentives and other charges direct incentive compensation related to the negotiation of new and renewal memberships and other direct and incremental costs are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the related memberships 
deferred tax asset recoverability we have deferred income taxes consisting primarily of net operating loss carry forwards for regular federal and state income tax purposes generated from the exercise of common stock options 
in estimating future tax consequences  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas generally considers all expected future events in the determination and evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we believe that our future taxable income will be sufficient for the full realization of the deferred income taxes 
however  sfas does not consider the effect of future changes in existing tax laws or rates in the determination and evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities until the new tax laws or rates are enacted 
we have established our deferred income tax assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax laws and rates 
we will recognize an adjustment to income for the impact of new tax laws or rates on the existing deferred tax assets and liabilities when and if new tax laws or rates are enacted 
washington  dc income tax legislation the office of tax and revenue of the government of the district of columbia the office of tax and revenue has adopted regulations in accordance with the new e conomy transformation act of the act that modify the income and franchise tax  sales and use tax  and personal property tax regulations  effective april specifically  the regulations provide certain credits  exemptions and other benefits to a qualified high technology company qhtc 
during the year ended march   the fiscal year budget support act of the act was enacted which  among other things  clarified certain provisions of the act 
we have performed an analysis to support our position that we meet the definition of a qhtc under the provisions of the act and we have submitted a claim for refund of certain prior year sales and use taxes paid to the district of columbia 
as a qhtc  our washington  dc income tax rate would be for five years and thereafter  and we would be eligible for certain washington  dc income tax credits 
in addition we would be entitled to relief from certain sales and use taxes 
while we believe we qualify as a qhtc  we have not recognized the impact of this election within the consolidated financial statements because of uncertainties inherent in the regulations and the audit process by which the office of tax and revenue would approve the claim for refund 
for financial reporting purposes  we have valued our deferred income tax assets and liabilities using washington  dc s currently enacted income tax rate of 
additionally  we have continued to provide for income  sales and use taxes as if we were not a qhtc 
however  if we had received a determination that we qualified for qhtc status as of march   we would have recorded a noncash charge to earnings of approximately million  representing the impact on our existing deferred tax asset of lowering the washington  dc income tax rate to  net of any income tax credits discussed above 
upon acceptance by the office of tax and revenue of our election as a qhtc  we will record the applicable charge 
additionally  we would recognize the refund of any previously paid or provided sales and use taxes at that time 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially expose us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and membership fees receivable 
we maintain cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities with financial institutions 
any unrealized losses on marketable securities are determined to be other than temporary  due to the nature of the investments 
the concentration of credit risk with respect to membership fees receivable is generally diversified due to our large number of members 
however  we may be exposed to a declining membership base in periods of unforeseen market downturns  severe competition or regulatory developments 
we perform periodic evaluations of the financial institutions and our membership base and establish allowances for potential credit losses 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued revised statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statement nos 
and 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services or incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments  focusing primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires public entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions and recognize the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  the amount of tax benefit relating to stock option compensation included in operating cash flows for periods prior to the effective date  will be reported in financing cash flows once the statement becomes effective 
sfas no 
r further allows for either a modified prospective method of adoption or a retrospective method of adoption  which may be back to the original issuance of sfas no 
or only to interim periods in the year of adoption 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
r in the quarter beginning april  we are evaluating the transition methods and the impact of sfas no 
r and expect that we will record substantial non cash compensation expenses following adoption 
the adoption of sfas no 
r is not expected to have a significant effect on our financial condition or net cash flows but is expected to have a significant adverse effect on the reporting of our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which is designed for safety of principal and liquidity 
cash and cash equivalents include investments in highly liquid us treasury obligations with maturities of less than three months 
at march   our marketable securities consist of million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by the district of columbia  million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by other states  and million in us government agency securities 
the average maturity on all our marketable securities as of march  was approximately years 
we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit ratings related to the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
this portfolio is subject to inherent interest rate risk as investments mature and are reinvested at current market interest rates 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our portfolio risk or income profile 
due to the nature of our investments we have not prepared quantitative disclosure for interest rate sensitivity in accordance with item of regulation s k as we believe the effect of interest rate fluctuations would not be material
