item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading global producer of branded bath and plumbing products for the residential  commercial and institutional markets 
our results of operations are reported in three business segments  consisting of the bath products segment  the plumbing products segment and the rexair segment 
our bath products segment manufactures whirlpool baths  spas  showers  sanitary ware  including sinks and toilets  and bathtubs for the construction and remodeling markets 
our plumbing products segment manufactures professional grade drainage  water control  commercial brass and pex piping products for the commercial and institutional construction  renovation and facilities maintenance markets 
the rexair segment  which was sold in fiscal  manufactures premium vacuum cleaner systems sold through independent distributors in the direct sales retail channel 
on june   we completed the sale of rexair to rhone capital  llc rhone in a transaction valued at million 
we recorded a gain of million and debt retirement costs of million associated with this transaction 
we also obtained an approximate equity interest in rexair s new parent company in conjunction with this transaction 
this investment is accounted for under the equity method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock apb no 

rexair is not being accounted for as a discontinued operation as a result of this continuing investment 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our share of rexair s earnings has been recorded in other income expense  net 
in all periods prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  rexair s sales and operating income are included in our consolidated sales and operating income results 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources for more information regarding the rexair sale 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of substantially all the assets and liabilities of eljer to sun capital 
eljer s operations are classified as discontinued for all periods presented and are excluded from the following discussion of continuing operations 
eljer was previously accounted for as part of the bath products segment 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources for more information regarding the eljer sale 
demand for our products is primarily driven by new home starts  remodeling and commercial construction activity 
accordingly  many external factors affect our business including weather and the impact of the broader economy on our end markets 
weather is an important variable for us as it significantly impacts construction 
spring and summer months in the us and europe represent the main construction season for new housing starts and remodeling  as well as increased construction in the commercial and institutional markets 
as a result  sales in our bath products and plumbing products segments increase in our third and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to the first two quarters of our fiscal year 
the autumn and winter months generally impede construction and installation activity 
housing starts  residential re sales  consumer spending and remodeling expenditures have a major impact on our consumer focused bath and spa businesses of our bath products segment 
the bath products segment generates the majority of its sales in the residential construction and remodeling markets 
we believe that worldwide macro economic and demographic factors such as population growth and household formation will continue to drive demand in these markets over the long term 
our plumbing products business is dependent upon commercial and institutional construction activity and is therefore affected by macro economic factors such as economic growth and interest rates 
the us commercial and institutional construction market is cyclical in nature 
commercial and institutional construction increased slightly in after a few years of decline  and this market has continued to show signs of improvement during sales of our products have grown at rates in excess of market growth over the past few years as a result of product innovation  targeted marketing programs and an emphasis on customer service 
we believe that macro economic and demographic factors such as population growth and infrastructure demands will ultimately drive growth in these markets over the long term 

table of contents our board of directors approved a formal disposal plan for the sale of five businesses in december the disposal plan and a formal disposal plan for the sale of three businesses in february the disposal plan 
we have completed the sale of all businesses under both disposal plans

see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the sj transaction 
each of these disposal plans  in addition to the sale of eljer discussed earlier  qualified for treatment as discontinued operations  and accordingly  are not included in our discussion of results of operations of this annual report on form k 
summarized results of the discontinued operations through the dates of sale are as follows for the fiscal years ended october  october  september  in millions net sales operating loss loss from discontinued operations the decrease in net sales and operating loss over the periods presented is primarily the result of the lost contribution from the businesses for the periods subsequent to their sale 
in addition  loss from discontinued operations for fiscal included the loss on the disposal of eljer of million  net of tax  and fiscal included the loss on the disposal of the swimming pool and equipment  hearth and water systems businesses of million  net of tax

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal overall overall net sales increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the overall sales increase was driven by a increase in plumbing products segment sales  which offset a slight decline in bath product segment sales and the absence of rexair sales following the june  disposition mentioned in the overview section 
rexair contributed million of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal sales in fiscal also benefited from million of favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
operating income decreased million in fiscal compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the absence of rexair s earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal and a decrease in bath products unit sales 
rexair provided million in operating income in the fourth quarter of fiscal the plumbing products segment reported an increase in operating income  which partially mitigated the decline in the bath products segment 
operating income included restructuring charges of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal in addition  operating income included a million benefit from favorable foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal bath products sales in the bath products segment decreased slightly in fiscal as compared to fiscal foreign currency benefits of million were offset by a decline in unit sales primarily caused by a slow down in the uk market and softness in the italian bath and uk spa markets 
bath sales benefited from higher product pricing initiated to help offset higher energy  freight and raw material costs 
however  these higher prices were not enough to offset the reduced volume  primarily in our uk markets 
sales in the uk  our largest market outside the uk  declined by in local currency as the slow down in the uk market  which began in the second quarter of fiscal  continued through the end of the fiscal year 
as retail sales in the uk declined  customers reacted by reducing their inventory levels 
although we do not anticipate any significant recovery in the uk bath and sink markets or the uk spa market  we expect sales growth in the upcoming year to be driven by increased market share and continued growth in our emerging markets  primarily in europe 
we anticipate energy  freight and raw material costs to continue to escalate in the coming months  but at a slower rate than fiscal we intend to increase prices as necessary to help offset cost increases 
operating income decreased million in fiscal compared to last year 
the decline in unit sales also triggered decreases in production levels  which resulted in lower absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
the uk and italian bath businesses were also affected by a shift in mix to lower margin products 
fiscal operating income also included higher costs associated with our global branding  marketing and product development initiatives  costs associated with the enhancement of our overseas sourcing capabilities and the expansion of the malta stainless steel sink plant 
these costs were partially offset by the settlement of a dispute with the previous owners of the sundance spas business over pre acquisition warranty costs for million  resulting in a reduction in warranty costs of million 
results for fiscal included a million increase in bad debt reserves associated with financial difficulties encountered by several brazilian distributors and million in severance related to the replacement of the management team and staffing reductions in brazil 
our brazilian operations experienced significant increases in sales and operating income in fiscal as a result of the organizational changes and new programs implemented by the new management team 
operating income included net restructuring charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these charges 
plumbing products sales in the plumbing products segment increased to million in fiscal compared to last year 
the higher sales were driven by continued growth in principal markets  successful new product 
table of contents introductions and improved pricing 
we believe we will see continued growth in the plumbing business in the coming year 
operating income for fiscal increased to million as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of strong sales volume 
increased brass  steel and resin costs were offset by favorable pricing and lower purchased parts costs resulting from new sourcing initiatives 
we expect costs to continue to increase  but at a slower pace than last year 
we intend to increase prices as necessary to help offset cost increases 
rexair as discussed above in the overview section  we sold our investment in rexair to rhone on june  therefore  the table above only includes rexair operations through the sale date  whereas fiscal reflects a full year of operations 
corporate expenses corporate expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal expenses included restructuring charges of million primarily related to the elimination of certain executive positions 
in addition to the restructuring charge  the year over year increase was primarily attributable to a reserve for an intangible tax settlement million  reduced pension income due to a lower discount rate and increased amortization of net actuarial losses million  and increased audit and other fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance million partially offset by a reduction in compensation and benefit costs million 
fiscal included a reversal of the restructuring reserve for unused leased space of million associated with the customer service function that was relocated to the shared services operations center 
interest income and expense the decrease in interest expense of million from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to lower debt balances 
interest income in fiscal includes interest of million received from the irs for an audit settlement 
other expense  net other expense  net consists of the following for the fiscal years ended october  october  in millions keller ladder expenses loss gain on sales of other non operating assets gain loss on sale of excess properties and equipment foreign currency transaction gains losses debt retirement costs earnings on equity investment in rexair other  net we retained certain obligations related to our keller ladder subsidiary after the october sale 
we continue to incur expenses related to those obligations 
the debt retirement costs are associated with the pay down of the term loan  which was retired with proceeds from the sale of rexair 

table of contents taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal declined as a result of the following no taxes will be incurred on the rexair gain because it resulted in a capital loss for tax purposes 
a million tax benefit was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal upon the completion of a federal tax audit of a subsidiary 
a million tax benefit was recognized in fiscal as a result of a federal tax audit of our consolidated tax returns for the fiscal years through the benefit resulted from agreed upon computational adjustments 
the irs provided their final report for this audit in august we filed an appeal with the irs in september regarding various issues that we could not reach agreement on 
we have adequate reserves to cover the current proposed adjustments 
excluding the impact of these three items  our effective tax rate for the year has increased as a result of the change in the mix of foreign and domestic earnings after the sales of rexair and eljer 
during fiscal  we received a refund of million relating to the examination of the federal income tax returns for the fiscal years through this refund was already included in our tax rates in prior periods

operating income of million for fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal  due primarily to strong sales and margin growth in the domestic spa and whirlpool bath businesses

these efficiencies were experienced segment wide  but especially in the new chino  ca plant which became operational in fiscal included in operating income was million in restructuring charges  while fiscal included million 
these charges are discussed more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements

in fiscal  we also established a million bad debt reserve against a receivable from one of the same brazilian distributors 
we have since taken over sales responsibility for the brazilian home center channel

favorable currency exchange rates improved earnings in fiscal when compared to fiscal by million 
plumbing products net sales in the plumbing products segment increased million or in fiscal when compared with fiscal sales in fiscal increased as a result of continued market penetration particularly in the pex and commercial brass product lines

operating income decreased million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal excluding the million gain on the sale of the technology license in fiscal  operating income increased in fiscal as a result of improved sales and favorable pricing  which helped to offset higher scrap iron and steel costs 
we implemented initiatives targeting procurement and finished product pricing to offset the increased raw material costs 
we began realizing the benefits of these procurement and pricing initiatives in the latter half of fiscal rexair net sales increased million or in fiscal as compared with the previous fiscal year 
the increase was due to the higher price points of the new e rainbow tm vacuum cleaner system  which was launched earlier that year 
the rollout of the new e model was completed during the second quarter of fiscal operating income in fiscal increased million or when compared with fiscal fiscal operating income was negatively impacted by million in costs associated with the aforementioned launch of the new e model

net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal in fiscal  we received million from the previous owners of the sundance spas business as a result of the resolution of a litigation claim and a million canadian tax refund 
during fiscal  we collected million in long term receivables and a million tax refund 
we typically use cash in the first half of the fiscal year due to the seasonality of most of our businesses 
weather can significantly impact construction and installation  which ultimately impacts sales in our bath products and plumbing products segments 
sales of outdoor jetted spas and other products are also sensitive to weather conditions and tend to decrease during the fall and winter months predominantly the first and second fiscal quarters 
subsequent to year end  we approved offers to buyout certain vested post employment benefit plan liabilities owed to participants who are currently retired or terminated

net cash used in investing activities in fiscal included million in capital expenditures  net proceeds of million associated with the sale of two discontinued businesses and proceeds of million from the sale of an excess property and fixed assets 

table of contents we expect total capital expenditures for fiscal to be approximately to million for new business requirements  system upgrades and implementations  initiatives involving the consolidation of workflows and improvement of manufacturing efficiencies and other capital requirements in the ordinary course of business 
we are also considering broadening our plumbing products segment product portfolio through acquisitions  remaining mindful that any such purchase be strategic in fit and accretive to earnings 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  we reduced our total debt borrowings by million

the net cash proceeds from the senior notes were approximately million after transaction fees 
transaction fees were capitalized and are being amortized over the seven year term of the senior notes 
the net proceeds from the senior notes  together with the initial borrowings under the term loan and asset based loan  were used to repay the debt and redeem senior notes that were outstanding at that time 
the senior notes  which were previously registered with the securities and exchange commission under the securities act  were de registered on march  the senior notes are due on july  and require the payment of interest of million on january and july of each year 
the indentures to the senior notes limit our ability to pay dividends  repurchase stock and make other restricted payments as defined therein 
on and after july   we can redeem the senior notes subject to a redemption premium of for the first months and for the following months 
on and after july   the senior notes can be redeemed at face value

table of contents eligible inventory 
there are several fees associated with the asset based credit facility including an unused commitment fee of  a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable libor margin and a fronting fee of on all outstanding letters of credit 
the weighted average interest rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the asset based credit facility requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  which is only applicable if our availability under the asset based credit facility falls below million 
we were not subject to this debt covenant at fiscal year end because our availability exceeded the required threshold 
we expect to maintain availability in excess of million for the foreseeable future 
this credit facility also includes a restriction on the payment of dividends 
the availability under our asset based credit facility must be reduced by the amount that our cash balance falls below the million excess proceeds we received from the sale of rexair 
we are required to either reinvest the excess proceeds in our business or offer to redeem the senior notes at par within one year of the date of sale 
our cash balance exceeded million at september   thus the availability under the asset based credit facility was not impacted by this bank facility requirement 
certain of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries guarantee the senior notes  jointly and severally  on a senior basis 
the senior notes are secured by an eligible first lien on domestic property  plant and equipment  and a second lien on the assets that secure the bank facilities 
the asset based credit facility is secured by a first lien on accounts receivable  inventory  intangibles  the stock of our domestic subsidiaries and of the stock of our first tier foreign subsidiaries

new accounting pronouncements in june  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf 
eitf requires that a general partner in a limited partnership consolidate the partnership unless the presumption of control can be overcome by showing that the limited partners have the ability to dissolve the partnership or otherwise remove the general partner without cause or possess substantive participating rights 
eitf is effective for a general partners of all newly formed limited partnerships and b existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements are modified 
for general partners in all other limited partnerships  it is effective no later than the beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after december  we are in the process of determining the impact of eitf on our results of operations  however  we do not expect the impact to be material to our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 

this statement requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the basis of the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas no 
also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived non financial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
the new standard is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the impact of sfas no 
cannot be determined unless and until a change in accounting principle or estimate arises 
we do not anticipate any changes in accounting principle at this time 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
this interpretation clarifies that conditional asset retirement obligations meet the definition of a liability and should be recognized when incurred if the fair value can be reasonably estimated 
fin also provides guidance as to when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

the statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow  as prescribed under current accounting rules 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
total cash flow will remain unchanged from what would have been reported under prior accounting rules 
in april  the securities and exchange commission adopted a new rule that amends the effective dates for sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the new rule  the accounting provisions of sfas no 
r will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods modified prospective or modified retrospective 
the modified prospective method requires compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted  modified or settled after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate  based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures  either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will not affect our total cash flows or financial position  but it will reduce reported income 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  in the first quarter of fiscal  upon adoption of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application method  we expect to recognize an immaterial one time pre tax gain  representing the reversal of compensation costs recorded in prior years for restricted stock awards that are not expected to vest due to future forfeitures 
we currently recognize compensation costs over the explicit service period for restricted stock awards subject to acceleration of vesting upon retirement 
however  this policy must change upon adoption of sfas no 
r 
for awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas r  we will continue to recognize compensation cost over the explicit service period and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when an employee actually retires 
for awards granted or modified after the adoption of sfas r and subject to acceleration of vesting upon retirement  we will recognize compensation cost over a period to the date the employee first becomes eligible for retirement 
had we recognized compensation cost at the point an employee is eligible for retirement  recognized compensation cost would have increased by approximately million in fiscal compensation cost in fiscal and fiscal would have remained approximately the same 
we are in the process of determining how the guidance regarding valuing share based compensation as prescribed by sfas no 
r will be applied to valuing share based awards granted after the effective date and the impact that the recognition of compensation expense related to such awards will have on our financial statements

fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp no 

fsp no 
provides that the tax deduction on qualified production activities allowed under the act should be treated as a special deduction rather than a tax rate deduction 
the act allows us to begin taking this deduction beginning in fiscal we have not yet assessed the impact these potential tax deductions will have on our financial position and results of operations 
fsp no 
provides accounting and disclosure guidance for a special one time dividends received deduction allowed on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer  provided certain criteria are met 
this guidance became effective for us in the first quarter of  however  it allows for an exception to the requirement to reflect in the period of enactment the effect of a new tax law 
we have a policy of repatriating foreign earnings 
in addition  various provisions under the internal revenue code have created situations that result in deemed dividends 
we have completed our evaluation of the potential benefits of these deductions under the act 
the law requires that we distribute the deemed dividends before any dividends are eligible for the tax deduction 
the law also requires that we exceed an average historical level of dividends before any dividend we declared would be eligible for the benefit 
we currently have approximately million of deemed dividends that have not been distributed 
as of september   we had approximately million of earnings that would qualify for the new dividend deduction 
given the level of actual and deemed dividends over the past five years  we will not benefit from this deduction

effects of inflation because of the relatively low level of inflation experienced in most of our principal markets  general inflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations during the periods presented 
we have  however  experienced increased energy  freight  oil and metal based raw material costs 
favorable pricing of our products have helped to offset these increases 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
reported amounts and disclosures may have been different had management used different estimates and assumptions or if 
table of contents different conditions had occurred in the periods presented 
our accounting policies can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
below is a discussion of the policies that we believe may involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
trade receivables we record an allowance for doubtful accounts  reducing our receivables balance to an amount we estimate is collectible from our customers 
we use significant judgment in estimating uncollectible amounts  considering numerous factors such as current overall economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical and current customer performance and customer relationships 
although we consider our allowances for uncollectible accounts to be adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions or customer circumstances could have a material effect on the reserve balances required 
historically  actual results have not deviated significantly from those previously estimated by management 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
we review our inventory balances to determine if inventories can be sold at amounts equal to or greater than their recorded values 
the review includes the identification of slow moving inventories  obsolete inventories and discontinued products based on the historical performance of the inventories and current operational plans for inventories  as well as estimated future customer demand for the inventories 
historically  actual results have not deviated significantly from those previously estimated by management 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects  based on current law  of any temporary differences in the timing of when net sales and expenses are recognized for tax purposes and when they are recognized for financial statement purposes 
management reviews the deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability  and valuation allowances are provided as necessary 
we consider expected future income and gains from investments as well as tax planning strategies  including the potential sale of certain assets  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
if future taxable income is different than expected  we may need to change our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluation of our tax provisions 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we estimate tax exposures and establish reserves when in our judgment we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale we record reserves for the difference between the carrying value and the net realizable value of our net assets held for sale 
these reserves require that management make assumptions about estimated proceeds  based on the demand for these assets and current market conditions  and about estimated costs to sell  based on management s professional knowledge and experience 
we monitor these reserves on an on going basis and record adjustments to our estimates based on actual results and management s updated knowledge 
assets held for sale have been evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

goodwill we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
changes in strategy  reporting unit operating results and or market conditions could significantly impact our judgment and could require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets sfas no 
 we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
table of contents annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or earlier in the year if indications of impairment arise 
the results of any of these tests could require adjustments to recorded asset balances in future periods 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities in establishing accruals for restructuring costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we measure our liability at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
in estimating the fair value of expected exit and disposal costs  we make certain assumptions to determine the remaining lease obligations  sublease income  severance costs  relocation costs and other exit costs 
while we feel our assumptions are appropriate  there can be no assurance that actual costs will not differ from estimates used to establish the restructuring reserves 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we may need to adjust  upward or downward  our restructuring reserves in the future 
additionally  long lived assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 which involves the use of estimates to calculate fair value  future cash flows and costs to sell 
these estimates may differ from actual amounts realized in future periods 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  labor  product and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
we determine the amount of reserves needed  if any  for each individual issue based on our professional knowledge and experience and discussions with legal counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter  the ultimate resolution of each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy  in dealing with these matters 
we have sold a number of assets and businesses over the last several years and have  on occasion  provided indemnification for liabilities relating to product liability  environmental and other claims 
we have recorded reserves for claims related to these obligations when appropriate and  on certain occasions  have obtained the assistance of an independent actuary in the determination of those reserves 
if actual experience deviates from our estimates  we may need to record adjustments to these liabilities in future periods 
our insurance programs for workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured 
we record self insurance accruals based on our estimates of the fully developed cost of claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported are developed by us with the help of an independent actuary 
if actual experience of claims development is significantly different than our estimates  an adjustment to our self insurance accruals may need to be recorded in future periods 
warranty reserves reserves are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets to reflect our contractual liabilities relating to warranty commitments to our customers 
we provide warranty coverage of various lengths and terms to our customers depending on standard offerings and negotiated contractual agreements 
we record an estimate for warranty expense at the time of sale based on historical warranty return rates and repair costs 
should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which these additional reserves are required 
pension and other post employment benefits we have significant pension and post retirement benefit income and expense and assets liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
these valuations include key assumptions regarding discount rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  merit and promotion increases and the current health care 
table of contents cost trend rate 
we consider current market conditions in selecting these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit income costs or assets liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions and changes in asset values 
when valuing the pension plans at the end of fiscal  we reduced our discount rate by basis points for our domestic plan and basis points for our uk plan 
future changes in the assumptions underlying our pension valuations  including those that arise as a result of declines in equity markets and interest rates  could result in further reductions in pension income  which could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations in future periods 
we recognized million of pension expense in fiscal and million and million of pension income in fiscal and  respectively 
these amounts affected our operating income by an equal amount for each of the respective periods 
excluding service costs  we recognize pension income related to our domestic master pension plan 
this income is included as a reduction of our corporate expenses 
our domestic master pension plan covers certain employees in our operating segments and our corporate office  as well as certain employees of companies that we previously owned 
service costs associated with our domestic master pension plan are allocated to the operating segments and corporate based on employee data 
pension expense associated with our foreign pension plans and our other post employment benefit plans are recorded by the business whose employees benefit from such plans and are not shared between operating segments 
environmental liabilities we accrue an estimated liability for each environmental matter when the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss associated with such unfavorable outcome is reasonably estimable 
we presume that a matter is probable of an unfavorable outcome if a litigation has commenced or a claim has been asserted or if commencement of litigation or assertion of a claim is probable and b if we are somehow associated with the site 
in addition  if the reporting entity has been named as a potentially responsible party prp  an unfavorable outcome is presumed 
estimating environmental remediation liabilities involves an array of issues at any point in time 
in the early stages of the process  cost estimates can be difficult to derive because of uncertainties about a variety of factors 
for this reason  estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly  and  in many cases  early estimates later require significant revision 
the following are some of the factors that are integral to developing cost estimates the extent and types of hazardous substances at a site  the range of technologies that can be used for remediation  evolving standards of what constitutes acceptable remediation  and the number and financial condition of other prps and the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 
an estimate of the range of an environmental remediation liability typically is derived by combining estimates of various components of the liability  which themselves are likely to be ranges 
at the early stages of the remediation process  particular components of the overall liability may not be reasonably estimable 
this fact does not preclude our recognition of a liability 
rather  the components of the liability that can be reasonably estimated are viewed as a surrogate for the minimum in the range of our overall liability 
estimated legal and consulting fees are included as a component of our overall liability 
certain environmental contamination treatment costs are capitalized in accordance with eitf issue no 
 capitalization of costs to treat environmental contamination  while most of them are charged 
table of contents to expense when they are incurred 
if the costs are recoverable  they are capitalized only if one of following criteria is met the costs extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of property owned 
the condition of that property after the costs are incurred must be improved as compared with the condition of that property when originally constructed or acquired 
the costs mitigate or prevent environmental contamination that has yet to occur and that otherwise may result from future operations or activities 
in addition  the costs improve the property compared with its condition when constructed or acquired 
the costs are incurred in preparing for sale that property which is currently held for sale 
asbestos claims and insurance for asbestos claims as noted in item legal proceedings of this annual report on form k  zurn records a liability for pending and potential future asbestos claims  as well as a receivable for insurance coverage of such liability 
the valuation of zurn s potential asbestos liability  which was performed this year by an independent economic consulting firm with substantial experience in asbestos liability valuations  was based on the number and severity of future asbestos claims  future settlement costs  and the effectiveness of zurn s defense strategies and settlement initiatives 
zurn s present estimate of its asbestos liability assumes i its continuous vigorous defense strategy will remain effective  ii new asbestos claims filed annually against it will decline modestly through  iii the values by disease will remain consistent with past experience and iv its insurers will continue to pay defense costs without eroding the coverage amounts of its insurance policies 
zurn s potential asbestos liability could be adversely affected by changes in law and other factors beyond its control 
further  while zurn s current asbestos liability is based on an estimate of claims through  such liability may continue beyond  and such liability could be substantial 
zurn estimates that its available insurance to cover its potential asbestos liability as of the end of fiscal is greater than its potential asbestos liability 
this conclusion was reached after considering zurn s experience in asbestos litigation  the insurance payments made to date by zurn s insurance carriers  existing insurance policies  the industry ratings of the insurers and the advice of insurance coverage counsel with respect to applicable insurance coverage law relating to the terms and conditions of those policies 
zurn used these same considerations when evaluating the recoverability of its receivable for insurance coverage of potential asbestos claims 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and we have no remaining obligations  prices are fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we make shipments to approved customers based on orders placed 
prices are fixed when the customer places the order 
an approved customer is one that has been subjected to our credit evaluation 
we record revenue when title passes  which is either at the time of shipment or upon delivery to the customer 
the passage of title is dependent on the arrangements made with each customer 
provisions are made for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale 
we use significant judgment in estimating sales return costs  considering numerous factors such as current overall and industry specific economic conditions and historical sales return rates 
although we consider our sales return reserves to be adequate and proper  changes in historical customer patterns could require adjustments to the reserves 
historically  however  actual results have not deviated significantly from those previously estimated by management 
we also record reductions to our revenues for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered

the following are some of the factors we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results the seasonality of our sales and economic events may adversely affect our financial results and our ability to service our debt 
weather could adversely affect the demand for our products and decrease our net sales 
demand for building and home improvement products may depend on availability of financing 
we may be adversely affected by downturns in the markets we serve 
the markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive 
the loss of any significant customer could adversely affect our business 
an increase in the price of raw materials  components  finished goods and other commodities could adversely affect our operations 
we are exposed to political  economic and other risks that arise from operating a multi national business 
we are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks 
adverse investment returns and other factors may increase our pension liability and pension expense 
our financial statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 
we are subject to numerous asbestos claims that could adversely affect us 
we are subject to environmental regulation and incur costs relating to environmental matters 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights 
our failure to attract and retain qualified resources could have an adverse effect on us 
work stoppages and other labor problems could affect us 
we have substantial indebtedness and servicing our indebtedness reduces funds available to operate our business 
our debt instruments contain covenants which will limit our ability to operate our business 
to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to the risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates 
to limit the risks from such fluctuations  we may enter into various hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to our policies  but we do not engage in such transactions for trading purposes 
we did not have any variable interest rate debt at october   and we do not anticipate incurring substantial amounts of such debt during fiscal therefore  market risks associated with interest rate changes are expected to be minimal for fiscal we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our international operations as well as our us businesses  which import or export goods 
we have made limited use of financial instruments to manage this risk and have no such instruments outstanding as of october  hypothetical unfavorable movements of across each of the foreign exchange rates from which we have exposure would have decreased our estimated earnings from continuing operations by approximately million  before taxes  in fiscal and million  before taxes  in fiscal this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices
