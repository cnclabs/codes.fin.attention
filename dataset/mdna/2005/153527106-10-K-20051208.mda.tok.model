in fiscal  our income from operations was million of which garden products accounted for million and pet products accounted for million  before corporate expenses and eliminations of million 
background we have transitioned our company to a leading marketer and producer of branded products from a traditional pet and lawn and garden supplies distributor 
we made this transition because we recognized the opportunity to build a portfolio of leading brands and improve profitability by capitalizing on our knowledge of the pet and lawn and garden supplies sectors  our strong relationships with retailers  and our nationwide sales and logistics network 
our goal was to diversify our business and improve operating margins by establishing a portfolio of leading brands 
since  we have acquired numerous branded product companies and product lines  including wellmark and four paws in fiscal  kaytee products  tfh and pennington seed in fiscal  norcal pottery in fiscal  amdro and all glass aquarium in fiscal  lilly miller in fiscal  alaska fish fertilizer in fiscal  kent marine  new england pottery  interpet  krb seed company  dba budd s seed  and energy savers unlimited in fiscal  and pets international and gulfstream home garden in fiscal while expanding our branded products business  we experienced adverse events in our distribution business 
from to  we were the master distributor of round up and ortho 
in january  the scotts 
table of contents company  one of our largest distribution suppliers at the time  acquired ortho and became the marketing agent for round up 
in july  scotts terminated its relationship with us 
subsequently  we downsized our distribution operations and integrated these sales and logistics networks into our pet and lawn and garden products businesses to allow us to focus resources and provide strategic sales support for our brands 
virtually all of our sales before fiscal were derived from distributing other manufacturers products 
since then  our branded product sales have grown to approximately billion  or approximately of total sales  in fiscal during this same period  our sales of other manufacturers products have declined to approximately of total sales  and our gross profit margins have improved from in fiscal to in fiscal recent developments tfh verdict on september   the jury returned its verdict in the tfh publications  inc litigation following a five month trial 
the jury awarded central  for its claims against herbert and evelyn axelrod 
in a post verdict ruling  the court eliminated  of the jury s award 
the remaining jury award in favor of central also entitles central to interest  costs  expenses and attorneys fees 
the jury rejected most of the axelrods claims against central 
the jury did  however  award the axelrods million in damages for their claim that central had breached certain consulting agreements with them

pet products reorganization we are streamlining our operating structure into four strategic operating units within our pet products segment aquatics  dog cat  bird small animal and animal health 
the creation of these strategic operating units  we believe  will create scalable efficient operating platforms  more effective research and development and brand building initiatives  facilitate interaction with our retail customers and enable us to more seamlessly integrate potential future acquisitions 
we expect to incur million in net restructuring related costs in fiscal related to these infrastructure consolidation activities 
investments in information technology we are implementing a scalable enterprise wide information technology platform to improve existing operations  to support future growth and to enable us to take advantage of new applications and technologies 
we have selected sap as our software provider and anticipate investing approximately million over the next four years in phases to implement our new information technology strategy 
this initiative will combine our numerous information systems into one enterprise system that employs best practices from across our operating units and creates a common business model and common data  which should create greater efficiency and effectiveness 
share repurchase program on december   the board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program  in part  to minimize the dilutive impact of our equity compensation programs over time 
recent acquisitions we completed three acquisitions during the fiscal year ended september   for a total of million 
pro forma results of operations have not been presented for any of the acquisitions because the effects of these acquisitions were not material to central s operating results either individually  or in the aggregate 
the consolidated financial statements include the effects of these acquired businesses from the dates of acquisition 

table of contents these acquisitions are summarized as follows in thousands net tangible assets acquired other intangible assets acquired goodwill total consideration paid including transaction costs in the aggregate  in fiscal these acquisitions contributed million in revenue and million in operating income 
each acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relative percentages that certain income and expense items bear to net sales fiscal year ended september  september  september  net sales cost of goods sold and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative income from operations interest expense  net other income income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal increased million  or  to  million from  million in fiscal this was due to a million  or  increase in our branded product sales partially offset by a million decrease in the sales of other manufacturers products 
incremental net sales in related to acquisitions made in fiscal and were million and million related to organic sales growth 
sales of our own branded products represented of our total sales in fiscal garden products sales for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal in fiscal  our garden branded product sales increased million  partially offset by a million decrease in the sales of other manufacturers products 
the largest factors contributing to the sales increase of our garden branded products were incremental net sales from acquisitions made in fiscal and of million and increased sales of our wild bird feed of approximately million and ant control products of approximately million 
pet products sales for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal pet branded product sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and sales of other manufacturers products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increased sales of our pet branded products were due to incremental net sales in from acquisitions made in fiscal and of million and approximately million related to increased organic brand sales  including million of insect control products 

table of contents gross profit gross profit increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross profit increased million  or  in pet products and million  or  in garden products 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  as both pet products and garden products margins improved 
pet products margins improved from to and garden products from to in fiscal the margin improvements were due primarily to the incremental contributions from our acquisitions in fiscal and of approximately million  increased grass seed margins of approximately million resulting from focusing on higher profit product  increased insect control products of approximately million and million in improved gross margins and plant efficiencies in our bird feed operations 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased administrative costs and selling and delivery expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from during fiscal to during fiscal selling and delivery expenses increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the increase in sales and approximately million increase in common carrier and fuel charges 
selling and delivery expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal facilities expenses decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to facility shutdown costs within pet products recognized in fiscal warehouse and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal garden products increased million and pet products increased million due primarily to approximately million of such costs from recent acquisitions 
corporate expenses increased million due primarily to increased professional fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance of million and legal and litigation expenses of million  partially offset by million collected on a note previously considered uncollectible 
in order to achieve sarbanes oxley section compliance at fiscal year end  we incurred approximately million in fiscal other income other income increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal while our equity method investments performed better in the current year  million was related to one of our equity method investments being positively impacted by sales in fiscal  originally expected in fiscal  due to a change in the buying pattern of a customer 
as such  it is possible there will be no earnings in fiscal from this investment 
additionally  million of the increase was due to an equity method investment made in the current fiscal year acquired in connection with one of our acquisitions 
interest expense net interest expense increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased average borrowings during fiscal compared to fiscal and slightly higher interest rates on our floating rate debt partially offset by interest accrued on a third party note 
average borrowings for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal the average interest rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 

table of contents income taxes our effective tax rate in fiscal was compared with in fiscal the combined federal and state tax rate was approximately before a one time benefit of million related to an adjustment of prior year tax accruals recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the difference between the combined statutory rate of and the effective tax rate was due primarily to the impact of non us tax rates at our uk based subsidiary and the utilization of state income tax credits 
in fiscal  the difference was due primarily to the impact of non us tax rates and the utilization of state income tax credits 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal increased million  or  to  million from  million in fiscal this was due primarily to a million  or  increase in our branded product sales of which million related to our fiscal acquisitions and million related to organic sales growth 
sales of our own branded products represented of our total sales in fiscal garden products sales for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal in fiscal  our garden branded product sales increased to million from million in fiscal  and sales of other manufacturers products increased to million from million in fiscal the increased sales of our garden branded products were due primarily to million of sales from our fiscal acquisitions of new england pottery and budd seed  partially offset by a decline in grass seed sales of approximately million due to unseasonable weather conditions impacting demand at the retail level and a strong comparable in fiscal pet products sales for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal pet branded product sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and sales of other manufacturers products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increased sales of our pet branded products were due primarily to million of sales from our fiscal acquisitions of kent marine  interpet and esu and increased organic sales of million related to aquarium and insect control products 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal pet products gross profit increased million  or and garden products gross profit increased million  or 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting increases from to in pet products and from to in garden products 
these gross profit increases were due primarily to the million contribution from fiscal acquisitions and the restoration of wild bird feed product margins  which increased million  to more normal levels and a shift in product mix to higher margin products 
our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other entities since some entities include all of their distribution costs in cost of goods sold and others exclude a portion of them from gross margin and include them in an operating expense line item below the gross profit line 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased selling and administrative cost elements 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from during fiscal to during fiscal 
table of contents selling and delivery expenses increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to million from fiscal acquisitions and the fiscal organic sales increase  which led to increased selling and delivery expenses 
selling and delivery expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily driven by increased fuel and freight costs 
facilities expenses increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to million from our fiscal acquisitions and million in shutdown costs of a pet manufacturing facility 
warehouse and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal garden products increased million  pet products increased million and corporate increased million 
the increase was due primarily to million from our fiscal acquisitions  a million increase in salaries and wages and million in professional fees incurred for unsuccessful acquisitions 
other income other income decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal earnings from equity method investments decreased due primarily to an underperforming investment in a distribution company  partially offset by earnings from an investment made in the fourth quarter of fiscal interest expense net interest expense decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to million of fees and expenses incurred in fiscal associated with the early retirement of our convertible subordinated notes in january and the refinancing of our senior credit facility in may the impact of the increase in total long term debt during fiscal was offset by a slightly lower effective interest rate due to converting million of our fixed rate senior subordinated notes to a floating rate 
average borrowings for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of increased borrowings to finance acquisitions during fiscal the average interest rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 
income taxes our effective income tax rate in fiscal was compared with in fiscal our fiscal combined federal and state statutory tax rate was approximately as compared to in fiscal the difference between the combined statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate in fiscal was due to utilization of state income tax credits and the impact of non us tax rates at our uk based subsidiary 
in fiscal the difference was due primarily to utilization of state income tax credits 
inflation the results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation  we believe that the effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial 
weather and seasonality historically  our sales of lawn and garden products have been influenced by weather and climate conditions in the different markets we serve 
additionally  garden products business has historically been highly seasonal 
in fiscal  approximately of garden products net sales and of our total net sales occurred in the 
table of contents second and third fiscal quarters 
substantially all of garden products operating income is typically generated in this period  which has historically offset the operating loss incurred during the first fiscal quarter of the year 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our growth through a combination of bank borrowings  supplier credit  internally generated funds and sales of equity and debt securities to the public 
historically  our business has been seasonal and our working capital requirements and capital resources tracked closely to this seasonal pattern 
during the first fiscal quarter  accounts receivable reach their lowest level while inventory  accounts payable and short term borrowings begin to increase 
during the second fiscal quarter  receivables  accounts payable and short term borrowings begin to increase  reflecting the build up of inventory and related payables in anticipation of the peak lawn and garden selling season 
during the third fiscal quarter  inventory levels remain relatively constant while accounts receivable peak and short term borrowings start to decline as cash collections are received during the peak selling season 
during the fourth fiscal quarter  inventory levels are at their lowest  and accounts receivable and payables are substantially reduced through conversion of receivables to cash 
as a result of the reduction in sales of garden products manufactured by other parties as a percentage of overall sales  this seasonal pattern has become somewhat less significant 
we service two broad markets pet supplies and lawn and garden supplies 
our pet supplies businesses involve products that have a year round selling cycle with very little change quarter to quarter 
as a result  it is not necessary to maintain large quantities of inventory to meet peak demands 
additionally  this level sales cycle eliminates the need for manufacturers to give extended credit terms to either distributors or retailers 
on the other hand  our lawn and garden businesses are highly seasonal with approximately of garden products net sales occurring during the second and third fiscal quarters 
for many manufacturers of garden products  this seasonality requires them to ship large quantities of their product well ahead of the peak consumer buying periods 
to encourage distributors to stock large quantities of inventory  industry practice has been for manufacturers to give extended credit terms and or promotional discounts 
cash provided by operating activities decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to increased inventory and decreased payable levels  partially offset by increased earnings 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million from fiscal due primarily to a million decrease in cash used for acquisitions  partially offset by the proceeds from the escrow account  deposited in fiscal  which funds were used to settle the scott s litigation 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased million 
in fiscal  we borrowed an additional million under our six year term loan and repaid the million outstanding on our million revolving line of credit  borrowed in the prior fiscal year 
we currently maintain a million senior secured credit facility consisting of a million revolving credit facility maturing in may and a million term loan maturing in may interest on the term loan is based on a rate equal to libor or the prime rate plus  at our option 
interest on the revolving credit facility is based on a rate equal to prime plus a margin  which fluctuates from to or libor plus a margin which fluctuates from to  determined quarterly based on consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda for the most recent trailing month period 
in february  we exercised an option contained in our credit agreement to borrow an additional million under our six year term loan 
the total outstanding borrowings after the draw down under the term loan was approximately million and at september  was million 
the term loan is payable in quarterly installments of  with the balance payable in may this facility is secured by essentially all of our assets  contains certain financial covenants requiring maintenance of minimum levels of interest coverage and maximum levels of senior debt to ebitda and total debt to ebitda  and restricts our ability to make treasury stock purchases  investments in or 
table of contents acquisitions of a business and pay dividends above certain levels over the life of the facility 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of september  there was no balance outstanding at september  under the million revolving credit facility  and the remaining available borrowing capacity was million  with million outstanding under certain letters of credit 
in october  we entered into a million pay floating interest rate swap effectively converting half of our million fixed rate senior subordinated notes to a floating rate of libor 
in november  we deposited approximately million into an escrow account in connection with an appeal in the scotts litigation 
the use of this cash was restricted from general corporate purposes and is reflected as a restricted investment on our balance sheet as of september  in july  the previously escrowed amount was paid to scotts resolving all litigation  with no impact on current operating results 
at september   our total debt was million versus million at september  net debt  or total debt less cash and cash equivalents  increased slightly to million at september  versus million at september   summarized as follows fiscal year ended september  september  in thousands current portion of long term debt long term debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt the table below presents significant commercial credit facilities available to us and their associated expiration dates in millions maximum commercial commitments less than year years years total amount committed revolving line of credit with canadian imperial bank of commerce the table below presents our significant contractual cash obligations by fiscal year in millions contractual obligations fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total revolving line of credit facilities long term debt operating leases purchase commitments performance based payments total possible performance based payments associated with prior acquisitions of businesses are not included in the above table because they are based on future performance of the businesses acquired  which is not yet known 
performance based payments made in were not material 

table of contents we believe that cash flows from operating activities  funds available under our credit facility  and arrangements with suppliers will be adequate to fund our presently anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures will not exceed million for the next months 
the increased expected capital expenditures  compared to our historical rate  is due to our implementation of a scalable enterprise wide information technology platform to improve existing operations  to support future growth and to enable us to take advantage of new applications and technologies 
we have selected sap as our software provider and anticipate investing approximately million over the next four years to implement our new information technology strategy 
this initiative  when complete  will combine our numerous information systems into one enterprise system and create a common business model and common data  which should create greater efficiency and effectiveness 
as part of our growth strategy  we have engaged in acquisition discussions with a number of companies in the past  and we anticipate that we will continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates 
if one or more potential acquisition opportunities  including those that would be material  become available in the near future  we may require additional external capital 
in addition  such acquisitions would subject us to the general risks associated with acquiring companies  particularly if the acquisitions are relatively large 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting for stock based compensation we currently measure compensation expense for our employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and provide pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
we have followed apb opinion no 
because the alternative fair value accounting provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
under apb opinion no 
 when the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r requires all entities to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments 
upon adoption  all employee stock option awards will be recognized as an expense in our statement of operations  typically  over the related vesting period of the options 
sfas no 
r requires use of fair value to measure share based awards issued to employees  computed at the date of grant 
additionally  sfas no 
r requires companies to record compensation expense for the unvested portion of previously granted awards as they continue to vest  as calculated previously and included in the company s prior period pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
we will adopt sfas no 
r at the beginning of fiscal  as required  and will adopt the standard using the modified prospective method requiring us to recognize compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding as of the date of adoption 

table of contents we will recognize substantially more compensation expense in future periods as a result of adopting sfas no 
r and expensing the calculated fair value of employee stock options 
based on employee stock options outstanding at september   we will recognize additional compensation expense of approximately million  impacting fully diluted earnings per share by approximately per share for the fiscal year 
future grants in fiscal and in subsequent years will have further impact on earnings and earnings per share 
inventory pricing in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory pricing sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or consolidated balance sheets 
accounting changes and error corrections in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principles  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
this statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are required for  but are not limited to  accounts receivable and inventory realizable values  fixed asset lives  long lived asset valuation and impairments  deferred and current income taxes  self insurance accruals and the impact of contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
although not all inclusive  we believe that the following represent the more critical accounting policies  which are subject to estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for credit losses and disputed balances resulting from customers inability to make required payments 
we estimate our allowance based on both specific identification and historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  or we were not able to demonstrate the validity of amounts due  additional allowances may be required 
for more information  see note of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents inventory inventory  which primarily consists of lawn and garden products and pet supplies finished goods  is stated at the lower of first in first out fifo cost or market 
cost includes certain indirect purchasing  merchandise handling and storage costs including certain salary and data processing costs incurred to acquire or manufacture inventory  costs to unload  process and put away shipments received to prepare them to be picked for orders  and certain overhead costs 
we compute the amount of such costs capitalized to inventory based on an estimate of costs related to the procurement and processing of inventory to prepare it for sale compared to total product purchases 
when necessary  we have reduced the carrying value of our inventory if market conditions indicate that we will not recover the carrying cost upon sale 
future adverse changes in market conditions related to our products would result in an additional charge to income in the period in which such conditions occur 
goodwill in fiscal  at the time we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we recorded a pre tax million non cash impairment of our goodwill 
we test the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of our fourth quarter 
we use projected future operating results and cash flows of our reporting units to establish the fair value used in evaluating the carrying value of the associated goodwill 
if estimated future results of operations differ from those projections used by management  or if alternative valuation methodologies had been used in determining the reporting units fair value  additional impairment charges may have to be recognized as charges to income in the year in which such conditions occur 
as of june  and june   we performed our annual goodwill impairment analyses 
based on the results of those analyses  no additional reduction of goodwill was required during fiscal years or long lived assets we review our long lived assets for potential impairment based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets 
long lived assets are included in impairment evaluations when events and circumstances exist that indicate the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable 
measurement of impairment losses for long lived assets that we expect to hold and use is based on the estimated fair value of the assets 
we have recorded asset impairment charges when the carrying value of an asset was in excess of its fair value 
should market conditions or the assumptions used by us in determining the fair value of assets change  or management change plans for usage of certain assets  additional charges to operations may be required in the period in which such conditions occur 
stock based compensation we measure compensation expense for our employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and have provided pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method provided for under sfas no 
had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
as required under sfas no 
 the pro forma effects of stock based compensation on net income and earnings per common share for employee stock options granted and employee stock purchase plan purchases have been estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
for purposes of our pro forma disclosures which are included in note of our consolidated financial statements  the estimated fair value of the options and shares is amortized over the options vesting period 
although different valuation methodologies are available  we have chosen the intrinsic value method to account for common stock incentive awards 
this accounting policy has been applied consistently for all years presented 
operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
information about the impact on operating results of using apb opinion is included in note of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in fiscal  we will adopt sfas r and recognize compensation expense related to stock based awards 
in the future  we will expense the value of employee stock options based on amounts determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
had we used alternative valuation methodologies  the amount we expense for stock based payments could be significantly different 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes result primarily from bad debt allowances  inventory write downs  depreciation and nondeductible reserves 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment would be recognized in the period such determination was made 
we have determined that certain deferred tax assets associated with the potential tax benefit of state income tax net operating losses are not likely to be realized in the future and have provided a valuation allowance on those assets 
for more information  see note of our consolidated financial statements 
accruals for self insurance we maintain insurance for certain risks  including workers compensation  general liability and vehicle liability  and are self insured for employee related health care benefits 
our workers compensation  general liability and vehicle liability insurance policies include deductibles of  to  per occurrence 
we maintain excess loss insurance that covers any health care costs in excess of  per person per year 
we establish reserves for losses based on our claims experience and industry actuarial estimates of the ultimate loss amount inherent in the claims  including losses for claims incurred but not reported 
any differences in estimates and assumptions could result in accrual requirements materially different from the calculated accruals 
acquisitions in connection with businesses we acquire  management must determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
considerable judgment and estimates are required to determine such amounts  particularly as they relate to identifiable intangible assets  and the applicable useful lives related thereto 
under different assumptions  the resulting valuations could be materially different 
commitments and contingencies as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in several significant legal matters as well as other matters incidental to our business  the disposition of which are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we use our best estimates to determine the probable outcome and costs associated with the resolution of such matters 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and are based upon a combination of potential litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by adverse developments or changes in management s strategy related to these proceedings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and commodity prices and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
the interest payable on our credit facility and million of our senior subordinated notes is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates 
table of contents on our variable rate debt had changed by compared to actual rates  interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal in addition  we have investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments in marketable debt securities  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
commodity prices
