our merchandise strategy and our stores architectural style create a unique and attractive selling environment designed to appeal to an affluent  well educated to year old customer 
over the next decade  we believe the fastest growing segment of the us population will be to year olds 
we believe that as these customers evolve  so will their purchasing needs and desires 
we believe that our products can fulfill their aspirations to have homes designed with a high quality  classic and timeless style 
our plan is to fill the void in the marketplace above the current home lifestyle retailers  and below the interior design trade  by providing products targeted to to year olds and centered around our core businesses that reflect a predictable  high quality promise to our customers 
we operate on a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to january our current fiscal year ended on january  fiscal  and the prior fiscal year ended on january  fiscal and fiscal ended on february  fiscal 
fiscal  and each consisted of weeks 
as of january   we operated stores and one outlet store in states  the district of columbia and canada 
in addition to our retail stores  we operate a direct to customer direct sales channel that includes both catalog and internet  and a wholly owned furniture manufacturer 
in fiscal  we determined that we needed to implement a repositioning strategy to expand and clarify our core businesses  adjust down our proportion of lower margin furniture sales while increasing our higher margin textiles category  increase our direct imports  grow our direct to customer business and close underperforming stores 
we launched a new merchandising strategy in april  which included new merchandise offerings  adjustments of overall product mix  and the remodeling of our stores in order to best present the new merchandise 
in addition  to drive sales in our direct channels  we expanded our product assortment of catalog and internet only items 
in  we built on the prior year s successful launch by refining and expanding our core merchandise offerings  which include premium textiles  bath fixtures and hardware  lighting  and furniture and in  we re merchandised our furniture assortment and revamped our accessories offering 
we also redesigned our catalog in to improve the presentation of our core businesses and more clearly communicate the quality positioning of our offerings 
our customers have continued to respond positively to the new merchandise introductions in all channels 
we intend to further build on our core merchandise offerings in this shift will require some additional fixturing in our retail stores to accomplish the presentation of the expanded assortment 
our catalog and internet presentations will also reflect this expanded assortment 
in fiscal  we opened one traditional retail store  remodeled another store and opened our first outlet store 
the outlet store strategy enables us to more effectively liquidate overstocked  discontinued  damaged merchandise and over time  we believe will eliminate the need for the less productive warehouse sales events that we have historically held 
during fiscal  we continued programs initiated in prior years to improve our operating results  which included increases in our selling margins through sourcing changes  in particular  the expansion of our international sourcing 
we also effected significant changes in management in fiscal  particularly in the area of operations including the hiring of a new chief operating officer and the hiring into the new role of senior vice president of supply chain 
we believe these initiatives and added operational leadership will provide a strong foundation for margin expansion  operational efficiencies and cost reductions as well as provide a springboard for future growth 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate stores for closure based on underperformance 
during fiscal  we closed two underperforming stores  and cumulatively since fiscal  we have closed stores 
a material decline in sales and other adverse conditions resulting from our failure to accurately anticipate changes in merchandise trends and consumer demands may cause us to close additional underperforming stores 
as of january   we anticipated opening one new store in fiscal  and had no current plans to close any stores 
restatement of consolidated financial statements on february   the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease related accounting issues and their treatment under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
in response to this letter  management reviewed its lease accounting and determined that the company s method of accounting for rent holidays was not in accordance with gaap 
as a result  we restated our consolidated financial statements for fiscal years and prior 
historically  and consistent with industry practice  we have recognized the straight line rent expense for leases generally beginning on the store opening date which had the effect of excluding the construction period of our stores rent holiday from the calculation of the period over which we expensed rent 
we determined that the appropriate accounting treatment is to include the construction period in our calculation of straight line rent in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases 
we corrected our straight line rent accrual and deferred rent credits accordingly 
the cumulative effect of this restatement was an increase in accumulated deficit of million as of february  and increases in pre tax results of million million  after tax and million million  after tax for fiscal years ended january  and february   respectively 
additionally  we corrected an error recorded in fiscal related to tax accounting  the correction had the effect of increasing accumulated deficit and decreasing prepaid tax assets by million as of february  the corrections are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements of this report 
the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to these corrections 
summary consolidated statements of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the amount and percentage of net revenue represented by certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations fiscal of net fiscal of net fiscal of net revenue revenue revenue dollars in thousands  except per share data retail net revenue direct to customer net revenue net revenue cost of revenue and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative expense income loss from operations interest expense  net and other income loss before income taxes income tax benefit net income loss preferred stockholder return dividends income loss attributable to common stockholders income loss per share of common stock basic income loss per share of common stock diluted income from operations improved to million in fiscal as compared to a loss from operations of million in fiscal we recorded a net benefit for income taxes for the year of thousand 
this reflects the reduction of the income tax provision of million from the reversal of the valuation allowance established in prior years  offset by million of tax contingency and other adjustments 
net income was per share  or million for fiscal  compared to a net loss of per share  or million  for fiscal the improvement in operating results of million  to million of income from operations in fiscal from a loss from operations of million in fiscal  is the result of cost leverage achieved on higher revenue from all channels and the expansion of product margins  which were somewhat offset by higher costs of distribution 
net revenue increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  or  which largely resulted from a million  or  increase in our direct to customer sales  and a million  or  increase in comparable store sales  over fiscal the increase in comparable store sales over fiscal was driven by our ongoing focus on building brand authority in our core merchandise offerings and through annual  product focused sales events such as our famous fall lighting sale and our annual bath event 
the increase in net revenue in both our retail and direct channels can also be attributed to our focus on growing our catalog circulation  as the catalog is our primary advertising vehicle 
additionally  revenue from an outlet store and warehouse sales events totaled million for fiscal  compared to million of revenue from a warehouse sales event in fiscal the cost of revenue and occupancy increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  or  primarily in support of our revenue growth 
these costs rose at a lower rate than revenue as the expansion of product margins and the leverage of our store occupancy costs more than offset the higher costs that we continued to experience throughout most of fiscal in our distribution and supply chain activities 
this includes increases in freight costs as well as costs associated with investment in process improvement efforts including related labor costs and consultants that had been retained to temporarily manage those operations 
we have eliminated the need for temporary labor and consultants in our distribution centers as of the end of fiscal those costs are reflected in cost of revenue and occupancy on our consolidated statements of operations and are reflected in unallocated costs in note to the consolidated financial statements  segment reporting 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense of million in fiscal over fiscal  or  was primarily driven by variable costs incurred in support of the revenue increase such as store payroll and advertising  and such expenses were also impacted by increases in professional fees and brand advertising 
the increase in professional fees was primarily related to the implementation of the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  in particular  with respect to section requiring management to report on  and our registered independent public accountants to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
as a percent of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense remained at of net revenue in fiscal and cost of revenue and occupancy improved basis points to of net revenue in fiscal loss from operations improved to million in fiscal as compared to a loss from operations of million in fiscal net loss was per share  or million for fiscal  compared to a net loss of per share  or million in fiscal fiscal year included a one time tax benefit of million  or per share  related to the economic stimulus bill enacted on march  the improvement in the loss from operations in fiscal of million  to a loss of million as compared to a loss from operations of million in fiscal  is the result of cost leverage achieved on higher sales  expansion of product margins and leverage of store occupancy which was somewhat offset by increased costs of distribution 
the increase in net revenue of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  or  resulted from a increase in comparable store sales  and growth of our direct to customer business  which increased million  or  over fiscal the increase in comparable store sales over fiscal was driven by our brand building initiatives for our core merchandise offerings and the growth of our catalog circulation  which is our primary advertising vehicle 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and such increase was primarily attributable to higher payroll expenses and advertising costs which were incurred in support of our revenue growth 
selling  general and administrative expenses  expressed as a percentage of revenue  improved basis points in fiscal to of net revenue versus fiscal from leverage on higher sales  and the cost of revenue and occupancy improved basis points to of net revenue in fiscal our business is highly seasonal  which reflects a general pattern in the retail industry wherein the highest sales and earnings occur during the holiday season 
historically  a significant percentage of our sales have occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter 
in our peak holiday selling season  we incur significant additional expenses in connection with  among other things  the hiring of additional seasonal employees in our retail stores and the production and mailing of a higher volume of our catalogs 
revenue and segment results retail net revenue and segment results fiscal year dollars in thousands retail net revenue retail net revenue growth percentage comparable store sales growth income from operations income from operations percent of net revenue number of retail stores at beginning of year number of retail stores opened number of retail stores closed number of retail stores at year end store selling square feet at year end retail net revenue for fiscal increased by million  or  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million  or  increase in comparable store sales 
additionally  several previously opened stores  although not open long enough to be included in the calculation of comparable store sales  contributed positively to fiscal results 
fiscal retail net revenue also reflects million in revenue from outlet revenue and warehouse sales events  as compared to million in fiscal for a warehouse sale event held in that year 
we periodically hold warehouse sale events to liquidate our overstocked  discontinued and damaged inventory 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we opened our first outlet store  and over time we believe will eliminate the need for separate warehouse sales events as we open further outlet stores 
warehouse and outlet sales revenue is included in retail revenue  but is excluded from our comparable store sales 
for fiscal  income from operations for the retail segment increased to million from million in fiscal as a percent of segment net revenue  income from operations for the retail segment grew basis points  to of retail net revenue  as compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this improvement resulted from occupancy cost leverage achieved on higher sales  expansion of product margins as well as improvements in payroll and other store expenses expressed as a percentage of net revenue  offset by higher costs of freight and distribution and the costs of brand advertising 
income from operations for the retail segment reflects the results associated with store operations less retail field management costs 
retail net revenue for fiscal increased by million or   from fiscal primarily due to an million or increase in comparable store sales 
the increase in comparable store sales in fiscal was driven primarily by strong performance in our core merchandise offerings 
this increase was partially offset by decreased sales related to the closure of four underperforming stores during fiscal and the temporary closure of one store for expansion 
income from operations for the retail segment for fiscal was million  as compared to million in fiscal income from operations for the retail segment as a percent of segment revenue increased basis points  to of retail net revenue from of retail net revenue for fiscal  primarily due to occupancy cost leverage from increases in comparable stores sales assisted by improved margins offset by higher costs of distribution 
comparable store sales are defined as sales from stores whose gross square footage did not change by more than in the previous months and which have been open at least full months 
we believe that comparable store sales are a more useful indicator of store performance than the change in total net revenue  since comparable store sales exclude the effects of changes in the number of stores open 
revenue from outlet stores and warehouse sales events are not included in comperable store sales 
direct to customer net revenue and segment results fiscal year dollars in thousands catalog revenue internet revenue total direct to customer net revenue income from operations income from operations percent of net revenue growth percentages direct to customer net revenue number of catalogs mailed pages circulated direct to customer net revenue consists of both catalog and internet sales 
direct to customer net revenue for fiscal increased million  or  as compared to fiscal this increase was attributable to an expansion of the merchandise offerings in both the catalog and on the internet  coupled with an increase in the catalogs mailed during fiscal for fiscal  income from operations for the direct to customer segment increased to million  or of segment net revenue  as compared to million  or of segment net revenue  for fiscal segment results were favorably impacted by higher sales for the segment and product margin expansion  which was more than offset by higher distribution and advertising costs expressed as a percentage of revenue 
income from operations for the direct segment reflects the results associated with catalog and internet sales  less direct management costs 
direct to customer net revenue during fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal a portion of this increase was the result of a increase in the number of catalogs mailed in fiscal  as well as a change in our product mix in the catalog and an increase in catalog only furniture offerings 
additionally  we believe our website marketing efforts coupled with growing consumer familiarity with the internet and growth in high speed internet consumers also helped drive customers to our website 
income from operations for fiscal increased to million  or of related segment net revenue  from million  or  of related segment net revenue for fiscal  primarily due to the increase in our direct to customer revenue and improvements in our product margins  slightly offset by increases in selling general and administrative expense primarily due to advertising costs related to catalog production and mailing costs 
expenses cost of revenue and occupancy expense for fiscal  cost of revenue and occupancy expense expressed as a percentage of net revenue improved approximately basis points to  from in fiscal significant improvements were achieved due to the leveraging of relatively fixed store occupancy costs and improved product margins  which improvements were significantly offset by increased costs related to customer shipping  distribution and supply chain operations 
in fiscal  cost of revenue and occupancy expense expressed as a percentage of net revenue improved approximately basis points to  from in fiscal the majority of the improvement was achieved due to the leveraging of relatively fixed store occupancy costs and was partially offset by increases in distribution costs 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense expressed in absolute dollars increased million  to million for fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars is primarily related to an increase in advertising  including catalog production and mailing costs  and to a lesser degree  an increase in payroll expense and professional fees as well as other selling related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense expressed as a percentage of net revenue was consistent at for fiscal and fiscal we generated cost savings in retail payroll costs  which declined as a percentage of net revenue  reflecting continued management focus and the implementation of tools to manage retail payroll expense  as well as reductions in other store expenses 
higher levels of advertising costs and professional fees for fiscal largely offset these improvements 
advertising costs include expenses associated with catalog production and mailing as well as the costs of a brand advertising campaign 
in general  we expect that as the direct to customer channel revenue grows at a faster rate than retail revenue  the growth in the cost of advertising primarily catalog circulation costs will lead to increases in overall selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue  and this general dynamic inherent in our business model impacted our results for fiscal in contrast  the cost of retail occupancy has declined as a percentage of net revenue  the benefit of which is reflected in improved gross margins 
additionally  higher professional fees were incurred with the implementation of the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  in particular  with respect to section requiring management to report on  and our registered independent public accountants to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
selling  general and administrative expense expressed as a percentage of net revenue improved approximately basis points to in fiscal  from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense expressed in absolute dollars increased million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars primarily related to an increase in payroll expense and to a lesser degree  an increase in catalog production costs and credit card fees 
the improvement in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to the leveraging of store payroll costs  which declined as a percentage of net revenue  cost saving initiatives for supplies  partially offset by increases in advertising costs as well as increased credit card fees related to the conclusion in fiscal of our incentive program in connection with our private label credit card 
advertising expense for fiscal primarily represents costs associated with catalog production and mailing 
the increases in selling  general and administrative expense in absolute dollars were incurred largely to support our increase in net revenue 
interest expense  net and other interest expense  net and other includes interest on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and amortization of debt issuance costs 
for fiscal  interest expense  net and other was million compared to million in fiscal the million increase was due to higher average debt levels that were offset by lower average interest rates year over year and lower amortization of debt issuance costs 
in fiscal  interest expense  net and other was million  a decrease of million as compared to million in fiscal the decrease was due to lower average borrowing rates and lower average borrowings outstanding 
income tax benefit we recorded an income tax benefit for fiscal of thousand on pre tax income of million 
the fiscal income tax benefit reflects a benefit of million from the reversal of the valuation allowance established in prior years  offset by million of tax contingency and other adjustments 
excluding these items  our effective tax rate would have been for fiscal our effective tax rate was in fiscal  compared to an effective tax rate of in fiscal the fiscal rate reflects a million benefit realized due to the economic stimulus bill enacted in that year  which resulted in a reduction of the valuation allowance recorded in fiscal this reduction in the valuation allowance had the effect of increasing our fiscal tax benefit rate by percentage points 
as of january  and january   we recorded net deferred tax assets totaling million and million  respectively  which primarily represent the income tax benefit associated with losses reported in prior years and differences in fixed asset bases 
these losses are subject to federal and state carry forward provisions of up to years 
as of january  and january   we concluded that the net deferred tax asset balances of million and million  respectively  were more likely than not to be recovered 
if we are not able to maintain positive operating results in the future  a valuation allowance may need to be recorded 
preferred stockholder dividends dividend charges of million were recognized during fiscal associated with our outstanding series a preferred stock 
subsequently  pursuant to an august  letter agreement  holders of our series a preferred stock agreed to waive their dividend participation right in the event we were to declare a dividend on our common stock 
in the same agreement  we agreed that we would not declare any dividends payable to our common stock holders until we first obtain the approval of at least seventy percent of the then outstanding shares of series a preferred stock 
we have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and we have no obligation to do so 
as a result of the letter agreement  beginning with the second quarter of fiscal  we no longer record dividend charges related to our outstanding series a preferred stock 
liquidity and capital resources operating cash flows for fiscal  net cash used by operating activities was million compared to million of net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal the change in net cash used provided by operating activities resulted primarily from higher inventory purchases in support of higher sales and the acceleration of inventory receipts at year end including million of shipments in transit due to outdoor furniture and other spring selling programs 
we also experienced acceleration of the timing of payment for goods due to increases in the levels of foreign sourced merchandise that tend to have faster payment terms than domestic vendors 
additionally  net cash used by operating activities increased due to higher prepaid expenses associated with catalog costs 
these increases in net cash used were partially offset by higher accounts payable and accrued expenses balances 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million of net cash used by operating activities in fiscal the change in net cash provided used by operating activities resulted primarily from significantly lower merchandise inventory purchases from that required in the initial year of re merchandising efforts  our improved operating results  and an increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the impact of these items was partially offset by a decrease in deferred lease incentives and other long term obligations 
investing cash flows net cash used by investing activities was million for fiscal  an increase of million compared to million for fiscal the cash used for investing activities for fiscal primarily related to the opening and remodeling of two retail stores  the opening of our first outlet store and capital associated with distribution facility improvements and relocations 
net cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal  a decrease of million compared to million of cash used by investing activities in fiscal the million of cash used for investing activities in fiscal primarily related to capital expenditures associated with the opening of two retail stores  as well as the remodeling of one store 
financing cash flows net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal  compared to net cash used by financing activities of million for fiscal substantially all of the change in net cash provided used by financing activities resulted from an increase in net borrowings of million for fiscal  as compared to a repayment of borrowings of million for fiscal  under our revolving credit facility 
cash financing requirements were higher in fiscal as compared to the same period of fiscal primarily due to the effect of higher inventory levels overall  and higher inventory of predominately foreign sourced merchandise  which have resulted in an acceleration of the timing of payment for our goods 
net cash used by financing activities was million in fiscal  and net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal substantially all of the change in net cash provided used by financing activities resulted from net repayments of million in fiscal  as compared to net borrowings of million in fiscal  under our revolving credit facility 
we reduced the borrowings outstanding under our line of credit in fiscal due to expense leverage gained on increased sales 
in addition  we received million during fiscal in connection with the settlement of a claim  and million from the exercise of stock options 
as of january   our revolving credit facility provided for an overall commitment of million 
the revolving credit facility was amended in june to provide for additional borrowing capacity  reduced borrowing rates and elimination of limitations on capital expenditures and store openings 
in support of our expected continued growth  the amendment increased the initial available commitment to million  and further allowed us to request and receive incremental increases beyond the initial available commitment of million up to a maximum commitment of million  provided no default or event of default exists and certain other conditions are met 
the amendment also increased the amount available for letters of credit from million to million and modified certain other terms in the revolving credit facility  which had the effect of expanding the borrowing base 
as of january   million was outstanding under the line of credit  net of unamortized debt issuance costs of million  and there was million in outstanding letters of credit 
borrowings made under the revolving credit facility are subject to interest at either the bank s reference rate or libor plus a margin 
as of january   the bank s reference rate was and the libor plus margin rate was 
the availability of credit at any given time under the revolving credit facility is limited by reference to a borrowing base formula based upon numerous factors  including the value of eligible inventory and eligible accounts receivable  and reserves established by the agent of the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is structured to increase availability to meet seasonal needs 
as a result of the borrowing base formula  the actual borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility could be less than the stated amount of the revolving credit facility reduced by the actual borrowings and outstanding letters of credit 
the company had actual remaining availability under the revolving credit facility of million as of january  the revolving credit facility contains various restrictive covenants  including limitations on the ability to incur additional debt  acquisition of other businesses and payment of dividends and other distributions 
the revolving credit facility does not contain any other significant financial or coverage ratio covenants  nor does the revolving credit facility require us to repay all borrowings for a proscribed clean up period each year 
our revolving credit facility requires a lock box arrangement  which provides for all receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
this arrangement  combined with the existence of a subjective acceleration clause in the revolving credit facility  necessitates that the revolving credit facility be classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet  pursuant to guidance in the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force issue no 
 balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement 
however  we do not expect to repay  or be required to repay  within one year  the balance of the revolving credit facility classified as a current liability 
we currently believe that our cash flows from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility will satisfy our expected working capital and capital requirements  for at least the next months 
however  the weakening of  or other adverse developments concerning our sales performance or adverse developments concerning the availability of credit under our revolving credit facility due to covenant limitations or other factors could limit the overall availability of funds to us 
we may not have successfully anticipated our future capital needs or the timing of such needs and we may need to raise additional funds in order to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
we also may need to raise additional funds to respond to changing business conditions or unanticipated competitive pressures 
however  should the need arise  additional sources of financing may not be available or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
if we fail to raise sufficient funds  we may be required to delay or abandon some of our planned future expenditures or aspects of our current operations 
for more information  please see the section factors that may affect our future operating results  in particular the sections we are dependent on external funding sources which may not make available to us sufficient funds when we need them  and because our business requires a substantial level of liquidity  we are dependent upon a revolving credit facility with certain restrictive covenants that limit our flexibility 
contractual commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of january  payments due by period total fiscal fiscal through fiscal through thereafter dollars in thousands operating leases capital leases line of credit standby letters of credit trade letters of credit purchase obligations for inventory total gross of debt issuance costs of million 
we do not expect to be required to repay  within one year  the revolving credit facility that is classified as a current liability 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns  inventories  goodwill  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other facts and assumptions  including current and expected economic conditions and product mix  that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management believes the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue revenue is recognized at the time of customer receipt 
this can occur when an item is purchased in the store  or when the item is delivered to the customer 
we record the sale as revenue in the channel where the transaction originated 
shipping and handling we record shipping and handling fees as revenue in the revenue channel that originated the sales transaction 
costs of shipping and handling are included in cost of revenue and occupancy 
returns we provide an allowance for sales returns based on historical return rates 
merchandise inventories our retail inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost method 
manufacturing inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market with cost determined at standard costs  approximating average costs 
costs include certain buying and distribution costs  including payroll and other costs related to the purchase of inventory 
we write down inventories whenever markdowns reduce the selling price below cost 
additionally  we provide for reserves on inventory based upon our estimate of shrinkage losses 
we also write down our slow moving and discontinued inventory to its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if liquidation of the inventory is more difficult than anticipated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
prepaid catalog expenses prepaid catalog expenses consist of the cost to prepare  print and distribute catalogs 
such costs are amortized over the expected revenue generated from each catalog based on historical experience 
typically the cost of a catalog is amortized over approximately five months 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset  typically ranging from three to ten years for all property and equipment except for leasehold improvements and lease acquisition costs 
the cost of leasehold improvements and lease acquisitions is amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or applicable lease term 
operating leases we lease retail stores  distribution facilities and office space under operating leases 
most lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances  rent holidays  lease premiums  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
for purposes of recognizing incentives  premiums and minimum rental expenses on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases  we use the date of initial possession to begin amortization  which is generally when we enter the space and begin to make improvements in preparation of intended use 
for tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays  we record a deferred rent liability and report it as a long term liability on the consolidated balance sheets and amortize the deferred rent over the terms of the leases as adjustments to rent expense 
for scheduled rent changes during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy rent holidays  we record minimum rental expenses on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases 
certain leases provide for contingent rents  which are determined as a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels 
we record a contingent rent liability in other current liabilities and the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when management determines that achieving the specified levels during the fiscal year is probable 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
using our best estimates based on reasonable assumptions and projections  we record an impairment loss to write the assets down to their estimated fair values if the carrying values of such assets exceed their related discounted expected future cash flows 
we review goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances warrant 
if the carrying values of such assets exceed their estimated fair values  we record an impairment loss to write the assets down to their estimated fair values 
we generally evaluate long lived tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives at an individual store level  which is the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified 
we evaluate corporate assets or other long lived assets that are not store specific at a consolidated entity or reporting unit level  as appropriate 
since there is typically no active market for our long lived tangible and intangible assets  we estimate fair values based on the expected future cash flows 
we estimate future cash flows based on store level historical results  current trends and operating and cash flow projections 
our estimates are subject to substantial uncertainty and may be affected by a number of factors outside our control  including general economic conditions  the competitive environment and regulatory changes 
if actual results differ from our estimates of future cash flows  we may record significant additional impairment charges in the future 
store closure reserves the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  requires that for exit or disposal activities  initiated after december   we recognize a liability for costs associated with closing a store when the liability is incurred 
we record the present value of expected future lease costs and other closure costs when the store is closed 
we record severance and other employee related costs in the period in which we communicate the closure and related severance packages to the affected employees 
while we do not currently have any reserves established for store closures  we periodically make judgments about which stores we should close and which stores we should continue to operate 
all stores are subject to regular monitoring of their financial performance and cash flows  and many stores are subject to kick out clauses which allow us to terminate the store lease if certain contractually specified sales levels are not achieved 
if we decide to close a number of these stores  we may incur significant store closure costs for which we have not currently reserved 
self insurance we obtain insurance coverage for significant exposures as well as those risks that  by law  must be insured 
it is generally our policy to retain a significant portion of certain losses related to workers compensation  general liability  property losses  business interruption and employee health care 
we record provisions for these items based on an actuary report  claims experience  regulatory changes  an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported and other relevant factors 
the projections involved in this process are subject to substantial uncertainty because of several unpredictable factors  including actual future claims experience  regulatory changes  litigation trends and changes in inflation 
at january  and january   we had recorded accruals for these liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively 
income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires income taxes to be accounted for under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  we generally take into account all expected future events then known to us  other than changes in the tax law or rates  which are not permitted to be considered 
accordingly  if needed we may record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the amount of valuation allowance would be based upon management s best estimate of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
while future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning are considered in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  the necessity for an allowance is subject to adjustment in the future 
specifically  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
contingencies and litigation we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings  including litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business 
due to the uncertainties inherent in any legal proceeding  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any proceeding and may incur substantial costs to defend the proceeding  irrespective of the merits 
unfavorable outcome of any legal proceeding could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as appropriate  we assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
the amount of loss accrual  if any  is subject to adjustment if and when warranted by new developments or revised strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to these proceedings 
we accrue our best estimates of the probable settlement for the resolution of legal claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our best estimates of our probable liability in these matters may change 
other considerations the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in this annual report on form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
recently issued accounting standards in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
this statement is effective for our fiscal year end 
we believe the adoption of sfas will not have a significant impact on the overall results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued the revised sfas no 
r share based payment 
sfas r requires the recognition of stock based compensation expense relating to share based payment transactions in consolidated financial statements 
that expense will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued as of the grant date  based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest 
sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
sfas r is effective for interim periods that begin after june  the company is allowed to select from three alternative transition methods  each having different reporting implications 
we have not completed our evaluation or determined the impact of adopting sfas r

related party transactions during fiscal  stephen gordon was chairman of our board of directors 
our store in eureka  california involves two leases  one involving mr 
gordon directly and the other involving a partnership in which mr 
gordon is a partner 
the aggregate lease payments paid to mr 
gordon and the partnership were  for fiscal  and we believe that the lease arrangements involving mr 
gordon and the partnership in which mr 
gordon is a partner were made on terms no less favorable to us than could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties 
in january  mr 
gordon resigned from his role within the company and as chairman of the board 
jason camp  a senior vice president of our company and the son of one of our directors  robert e

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt rose more than from the bank s reference rate  our results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
we do enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the united states of america which  to date  have been settled mostly in us dollars and  therefore  we have only minimal exposure at present to foreign currency exchange risks 
historically  we have not hedged our currency risk and do not currently anticipate doing so in the future 
however  it is possible that in the future a growing number of our purchases outside of the united states of america will be made in currencies other than the us dollar 
consequently  fluctuations in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and other currencies may subject us to foreign currency exchange risks in the future
