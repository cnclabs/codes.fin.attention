item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth in this report  including those set forth under item  business risk factors 
overview we design  develop  and market interactive electronic player terminals and bingo systems 
we currently market portable systems that can be played anywhere within a bingo hall and fixed base systems with light pen or touchscreen activated monitors 
for our three most recent fiscal years ended october   and  our portable terminals generated approximately  and of our revenue  respectively  while  during those same years  our fixed base terminals generated the balance of our revenue 
as of october   we had systems in service in states and in six foreign countries 
we generate revenue by placing electronic bingo systems in bingo halls under contracts based on a fixed fee per use per session  a fixed weekly fee per terminal  or a percentage of the revenue generated by each terminal 
revenue growth is affected by player acceptance of electronic bingo as an addition or an alternative to paper bingo  and our ability to expand operations into new markets and our ability to increase our market share 
fixed base bingo terminals generate greater revenue per terminal than portable bingo terminals  but also require a greater initial capital investment 
we typically install our electronic bingo systems at no charge to our customers  and we capitalize the costs 
we record depreciation of bingo equipment over a three and five year estimated useful life using the straight line method of depreciation 
our expenses consist primarily of a cost of revenue  consisting of expenses associated with technical and operational support of the bingo systems within bingo halls  depreciation of bingo units  repair  refurbishment  and disposals of bingo units and related support equipment  and excess or obsolescence reserve  b general and administrative  consisting of activities associated with management of our company and related support  which includes finance and accounting  legal  compliance  information systems  human resources  and accounts receivable reserve  c sales and marketing  consisting primarily of commissions paid to distributors for promoting and supporting our products and an internal sales force with a focus upon generating new customers and upgrades for existing customers  and d research and development  consisting of company sponsored research and development activities to provide players with new or enhanced products on which to play electronic bingo 
during fiscal  a number of events occurred that affected  or may in the future affect  our results of operations or liquidity and capital resources 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  under the new rules  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if an impairment indicator arises 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we performed our annual impairment test at july  and concluded there was no goodwill impairment 
during our fourth quarter  we reviewed our current and expected future results of operations and determined that our future results of operations are expected to be less than previously anticipated  as a result of slower than anticipated development and introduction of new products and technology 
additionally  in november  we received an unfavorable judgment against us in an outstanding legal matter and recorded a litigation loss contingency in the fourth quarter of million 
as a result  we performed an interim impairment test at october  based upon this analysis  which included an independent valuation  we recorded an impairment of goodwill of  the impairment charge is attributable to the indicators described above 

table of contents the impairment of goodwill is based on an independent valuation using a combination of the market multiple  discounted cash flows  and comparable transaction approaches 
the multiples used in the market approach at october  were consistent with our historical market trends and a control premium of was applied to the estimated fair value as the market values were determined on a minority basis 
the discounted cash flows were based on a discount of and an effective tax rate of 
comparable transactions occurring during through were used as there were no significant comparable transactions during during october  we learned that the nigc was in the process of changing its regulations such that the pull tab game developed for our class ii gaming device would not be in compliance with proposed gaming regulations 
the proposed regulation would classify this game as a class iii game and with this classification we feel the market is limited for the game 
as a result  we believe that future cash projections for this game are not material and the game s entire value capitalized of  was charged to research and development expense 
we also analyzed our current assets  other assets  bingo terminals  and other identifiable intangible assets and concluded there were no impairment charges 
we have incurred significant expenses in aggressively defending or pursuing certain legal issues  including the litigation with a former distributor in texas  defense of a patent infringement lawsuit in nevada  and litigation with a former distributor for igs in mississippi 
on november   a jury awarded the former texas distributor  in compensatory damages while awarding our company  in compensatory damages 
the former texas distributor is seeking an additional  in legal fees and  in expenses and costs 
final entry of judgment has yet to occur in the case 
should entry of judgment occur  we will move for a new trial 
should the court not grant a new trial  we intend to post a supersedeas bond to stay collection while we appeal to the ninth circuit court of appeals 
at and for the year ended october   we have recorded an estimated loss contingency in the trend gaming systems litigation of  the estimated loss contingency is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
regarding the patent infringement matter  an unfavorable outcome at trial could result in substantial damages and payment of the plaintiff s fees and costs 
the mississippi distributor lawsuit could result in a punitive damages award which could be materially injurious to us 
we have not accrued any amounts related to the patent infringement matter or the mississippi litigation 
on march   the jury rendered a unanimous verdict in our favor awarding compensatory and punitive damages against trend gaming involving a prior distribution agreement in virginia in the total amount of approximately million 
the jury also returned a verdict against steven w 
and rhonda hieronymus awarding compensatory and punitive damages of  the court reduced compensatory damages against trend gaming to  the court affirmed  in punitive damages against trend gaming and awarded gametech costs of suit in the amount of  compensatory damages against mr 
and mrs 
hieronymus have been reduced to  but the punitive damage award against them in the amount of  remains unchanged 
of the total compensatory damages of million awarded to us   represents compensation for lost profits 
we can only collect such damages from one of the defendants to avoid a double recovery 
we have not recorded an estimated gain contingency as we can make no assurances whether we will be able to collect any award from the defendants 
we expended approximately million as an investment in bingo systems and related support equipment 
this investment included an increase in the number of installed traveler and ted c  color portable terminals 
we also upgraded our fixed base systems in many markets 
as a result of management changes and staff reductions during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we incurred approximately  of severance related expenses 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets 
table of contents and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  bingo unit depreciation  goodwill impairment  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for bingo terminals placed in bingo halls under contracts based on a fixed fee per use per session  a fixed weekly fee per terminal  or a percentage of the revenue generated by each terminal 
our revenue recognition is a key component of our results of operations  and determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states when all of the following factors exist a evidence of an arrangement with the customer  b play or availability of the bingo terminals  c a fixed or determinable fee  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
we exercise judgment in assessing the credit worthiness of our customers and therefore in our determination of whether collectibility is reasonably assured 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine these criteria are not met for future transactions  revenue recognized for future reporting periods could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the possible losses resulting from non payment of outstanding accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and distributors for credit worthiness  economic trends  changes in our customer payment terms  and historical collection experience when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also reserve a percentage of our accounts receivable based on aging category 
in determining these percentages  we review historical write offs of our receivables  payment trends  and other available information 
while such estimates have been within our expectations and the provisions established  a change in financial condition of specific customers or in overall trends experienced may result in future adjustments of our estimates of recoverability of our receivables 
reserve for bingo terminal obsolescence we provide reserves for excess or obsolete bingo terminals on hand that we do not expect to be used 
our reserves are based upon several factors  including our estimated forecast of bingo terminal demand for placement into halls 
our estimates of future bingo terminal demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete bingo terminals 
although we attempt to assure the accuracy of our estimated forecasts  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our bingo terminals and our reported operating results 
software development capitalization we capitalize costs related to the development of certain software products that meet the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas no 
provides for the capitalization of computer software that is to be used as an integral part of a product or process to be sold or leased  after technological feasibility has been established for the software and all research and development activities for the other components of the product or process have been completed 
we are capitalizing qualified costs of software developed for new products or for significant enhancements to existing products 
we cease capitalizing costs when the product is available for general release to our customers 
we amortize the costs on a straight line 
table of contents method over the estimated economic life of the product beginning when the product is available for general release 
the achievement of technological feasibility and the estimate of a products economic life require management s judgment 
any changes in key assumptions  market conditions or other circumstances could result in an impairment of the capitalized asset and a charge to our operating results 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we are required to perform an annual goodwill impairment review  and depending upon the results of that measurement  the recorded goodwill may be written down and charged to income from operations when its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value 
in addition  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  such as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  or a loss of key personnel 
as a result of the review for fiscal we determined there is a goodwill impairment 
any subsequent impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  a significant decrease in the market price of an asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates reduced profitability associated with the use of an asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
all of these assessments require management judgment 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various legal claims and legal proceedings 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain consolidated statement of operations data for our company expressed as a percentage of revenue years ended october  statement of operations data revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses general and administrative sales and marketing research and development loss contingency impairment of goodwill total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net income loss before provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss year ended october  compared with year ended october  revenue 
we generated revenue of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease of approximately  or  was a result of several factors  including fewer installed terminals and price erosion as a result of increased competition in the southern and western markets 
we believe the introduction of feature enhancements to existing products and the availability of new products will provide for future revenue growth 
however  it is difficult for us to predict the time required to move newly developed features and products through beta testing and regulatory approvals  where required 
our newest portable color terminal  the traveler  began with limited nationwide rollout in the third fiscal quarter of fiscal with favorable results 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue for fiscal was compared to for fiscal key components of our cost of revenue include  among other items  depreciation of bingo equipment and service and operations expenses 
bingo equipment depreciation and amortization of related intangibles increased by approximately million over fiscal  primarily due to our investment in traveler portable color terminals  ted c portable color terminals  and our fixed base terminals  and operations expense increased  principally due to employee severance costs and increased shipping costs 
additionally  costs associated with the obsolete bingo terminals  repair  refurbishment and disposal of bingo terminals and related support equipment increased  a increase  from the prior year  relating primarily to monitor disposals and the disposal of the first generation traveler terminals which were technologically obsolete 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a  decrease 
general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue for the current year were compared to for fiscal fiscal and fiscal included elevated levels of legal expenses  including those related to defense of litigation with a 
table of contents former distributor in texas  patent infringement lawsuit in nevada  litigation with a former distributor of igs in mississippi  and other legal proceedings including our litigation against a former distributor in virginia and kentucky and a virginia sub distributor in late the improvement in general and administrative costs came as a result of a decrease of  in consulting fees and a decrease in non litigation outside legal fees of  partially offset with increases of  in severance expense and outside accounting fees of  sales and marketing 
sales and marketing increased approximately  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue increased from during fiscal to during fiscal sales and marketing includes distributor commissions and personnel  travel  promotional  and support costs for our internal sales force 
distributor commissions increased  to million due to an increased percentage of revenues generated by distributors 
costs associated with our internal sales force grew by  as a result of an increase in severance costs of  and increases in non payroll costs such as travel  marketing  and facilities 
research and development 
research and development costs increased  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal research and development costs as a percentage of revenue increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the engineering staff 
employee severance costs in october were  the traveler terminal  that began beta testing in december and commenced limited nationwide rollout in the third fiscal quarter of fiscal  are the positive results of our efforts 
the emphasis on new product development and feature enhancements for existing products continues as a major focus 
during fiscal we capitalized internally developed software 
we capitalized approximately  of payroll related costs  from our research and development and software quality assurance functions  connected with the internal development of software that meets technological feasibility and recoverability tests in accordance with fasb statement no 
we had no such capitalized costs in fiscal provision for benefit from income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was approximately and for the fiscal years ended october  and  respectively 
the change in effective tax rate reflects certain permanent differences between financial accounting and tax accounting and the effect of state and federal income taxes and nondeductible expenses including goodwill impairment on the pre tax loss in fiscal versus pre tax income in the prior year 
year ended october  compared with year ended october  revenue 
we generated revenue of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase of approximately million  or  was a result of the acquisition of the assets of igs  the increase in the installed base of ted c color portable units  partially offset by decline in the installed base of black and white portable units 
the continued roll out of pay n play  our fast action  credit based pari mutuel bingo feature  also contributed to the growth in revenue 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year was compared to for fiscal key components of our cost of revenue include  among other items  depreciation of bingo equipment and service and operations expenses 
bingo equipment depreciation and amortization of related intangibles increased by approximately million over fiscal due to the acquisition of certain assets from igs  investment in ted c terminals and fixed base terminal upgrades 
service and operations expenses increased approximately million due to planned growth principally as a result of increased personnel costs 
other items in cost of revenue include charges for refurbishment  repair  and disposal of bingo terminals as well as recognition of excess or obsolete bingo terminals 
these charges in fiscal improved by million from the prior year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a million increase 
general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue for the current year were compared to for fiscal 
table of contents the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in legal and consulting expenses primarily due to defense of a patent infringement lawsuit in nevada  litigation with our former distributor in texas  litigation with a former distributor of igs in mississippi and other legal proceedings 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased from during fiscal to during fiscal sales and marketing includes distributor commissions and personnel  travel  promotional  and support costs for our internal sales force 
distributor commissions decreased  to million due to the changes in mix of revenue generated by distributors and those customers served directly by us 
additionally  fiscal included distributor termination and settlement costs 
the balance of the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to reductions in personnel related costs and travel expenses 
research and development 
research and development costs increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal research and development costs as a percentage of revenue increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the engineering staff and external project costs for new or enhanced products such as the traveler terminal  which was introduced at an industry show in september and began beta testing in december provision for benefit from income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was approximately and for the fiscal years ended october  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates reflect certain permanent differences between financial accounting and tax accounting and the effect of state and federal income taxes on the pre tax income 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities provided million of cash during fiscal compared to million during fiscal the million consisted primarily of net loss of million  adjusted positively by million for depreciation  amortization  and obsolescence provisions  provision for the trend loss contingency of million  impairment of goodwill of million  and a net change of  in deferred taxes and other operating assets and liabilities 
during fiscal  the million provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income of million adjusted by million for depreciation  amortization  and obsolescence provisions  taxes refunded of million  and a net change of million in other operating assets and liabilities 
we used approximately million of cash in investing activities during fiscal compared to million of cash during fiscal the million consisted of million of capital expenditures million of which was expended on bingo terminals and associated support equipment  the purchase and development of software and other intangible assets for a total of million  and an increase in short term investments of  during fiscal  the million consisted of million of capital expenditures million of which was expended on bingo equipment  the purchase of certain assets of igs and other intangible assets for a total of million  the buyout of two distributorship agreements for an aggregate of million  offset by a decrease in short term investments of million 
financing activities used million during fiscal compared to the cash provided of  during fiscal the million used during fiscal was primarily for cash dividends of million and payments of  on long term debt  offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of  the  provided during fiscal was primarily from proceeds of  from stock option exercises offset by payments of  on a note payable 
as of october   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
in addition to our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  we have a million line of credit with wells fargo bank  na  which has an interest rate based on the prime rate or london interbank offered rate libor plus  at our option  on which there was no outstanding balance at october  the credit line was reduced from million due to our results of operations and resulting 
table of contents failure to maintain certain financial covenants  and our litigation loss contingency 
the revolving credit facility expires on april  no assurance can be made for renewal 
at february   we were not in compliance with certain of the financial covenants and expect that we will not be in compliance with such covenants through april  the bank has agreed to continue the lending relationship  however  the bank reserves the right to terminate the agreement at their discretion 
we believe that cash flows from operations and cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments on hand and our available line of credit will be sufficient to support our operations  provide for budgeted capital expenditures  make our declared dividend payment for the first quarter of fiscal  provide cash collateral for the posting of a bond to appeal the jury decision relating to our former distributor in texas  and meet liquidity requirements through the remainder of fiscal our long term liquidity requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate at which we expand our business  and whether we do so internally or through acquisitions 
in addition  strategic opportunities we may pursue could require us to fund our portion of operating expenses of such ventures and may require us to advance additional amounts should any partners in such ventures be unable to meet unanticipated capital calls or similar funding events 
to the extent that the funds generated from the sources described above are insufficient to fund our activities in the long term  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if it is available  it will be on terms acceptable to us 
contractual obligations the following table presents information on contractual obligations held as of october  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations purchase commitments from time to time  we enter into commitments with our vendors to purchase bingo terminals and support equipment at fixed prices and or guaranteed quantities 
during the second quarter of this fiscal year  we entered into such an agreement with one of our vendors to provide approximately million in traveler terminals 
at october   million of the commitment was outstanding and all purchases are expected to occur by the end of the third quarter of fiscal inflation and general economic condition although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had  or is likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we maintain an investment portfolio  of approximately million  in available for sale debt securities of the us government and its agencies  and in investment grade corporate issues 
the values of these investments are subject to changes in interest rates 
however  because these investments are short term and are generally allowed to mature  we do not believe that any risk inherent in our portfolio is likely to have a material effect on expected cash flows 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when necessary 
our revolving credit facility with wells fargo is a million line of credit with an interest rate based on the prime rate or libor plus  at our option 
the credit line was reduced from million due to our 
table of contents results of operations and resulting failure to maintain certain financial covenants  and our litigation loss contingency 
the agreement contains certain restrictive covenants  which among other things require that specified financial balances and ratios be maintained  annual profitability be maintained  restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and payment of dividends 
the line of credit expires on april  no assurance can be made for renewal 
we currently maintain a zero balance on the revolving credit facility 
because the interest rate on the revolving credit facility is variable  our cash flow may be affected by increases in interest rates  in that we would be required to pay more interest in the event that both the prime and libor interest rates increase 
we do not believe  however  that any risk inherent in the variable rate nature of the loan is likely to have a material effect on our interest expense or available cash 
sensitivity analysis 
assuming we had a million balance outstanding as of october   the rate of interest calculated using the prime rate option would be 
our monthly interest payment  if the rate stayed constant  would be  if the prime rate rose to  which assumes an unusually large increase  our monthly payment would be  a more likely increase of or  given the recent trend of decreasing or relatively low interest rates  would result in a monthly payment of  or  respectively 
we do not believe the risk resulting from such fluctuations is material or that the payment required would have a material effect on cash flow
