 the company will present the operations of first bank of delaware as discontinued operations starting with the first quarter on january  the first bank of delaware was spun off 
all assets  liabilities and equity of first bank of delaware were spun off as an independent company  trading on the otc market under fbod 
shareholders received one share of stock in first bank of delaware  for every share owned of the company 
the short term loan and tax refund lines of business were accordingly transferred after that date 
however  the pa bank may continue to purchase tax refund anticipation loans from the de bank 
loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at the amount of unpaid principal  reduced by unearned income and an allowance for loan losses 
interest on loans is calculated based upon the principal amounts outstanding 
the company defers and amortizes certain origination and commitment fees  and certain direct loan origination costs over the contractual life of the related loan 
this results in an adjustment of the related loans yield 
loans are generally classified as non accrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest for a period of more than days  unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than days may also be classified as non accrual if repayment in full of principal and or interest is in doubt 
loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time  and there is a sustained period of repayment performance of interest and principal by the borrower  in accordance with the contractual terms 
generally  in the case of non accrual loans  cash received is applied to reduce the principal outstanding 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to operations 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectibles of the loan principal is unlikely 
recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
the allowance is an amount that represents management s best estimate of known and inherent loan losses 
management s evaluations of the allowance for loan losses consider such factors as an examination of the portfolio  past loss experience  the results of the most recent regulatory examination  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method of accounting 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities at the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are realized or settled 
in addition  a deferred tax asset is recorded to reflect the future benefit of net operating loss carry forwards 
the deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized republic first bancorp fees earned on short term loans which are not sold  are recorded as interest income 
at december   there were approximately million of these loans outstanding 
the majority of short term loans are now sold to third parties effective in the third quarter of the de bank records fees on sold loans as non interest income 
the de bank had total short term loan participations sold of million at december  the company evaluated these sales and determined that they qualified as such under fasb results of operations for the years ended december  and overview the company s net income increased million  or  to million or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share for the prior year 
while net interest income decreased million in primarily because fewer short term loans were retained but were instead sold  related loan loss provisions were reduced by million  more than offsetting that decrease 
increased volumes of such sales were the primary factor in a million increase in short term loan fee income from million in to million in in addition to the million reduction in the provision for loan losses due to fewer short term loan charge offs  a million third quarter recovery on a charged off loan resulted in an excess in the allowance for loan losses 
that excess  in conjunction with our customary credit analysis  also served to reduce the provision for loan losses in a favorable judgment on a lawsuit related to that charged off loan resulted in million of other income in increases in service fees on deposit accounts  tax refund products and other income amounted to million 
the increased net income resulted in a return on average assets and average equity of and  respectively  in compared to 
and  respectively  for the same period in republic first bancorp analysis of net interest income historically  the company s earnings have depended primarily upon the banks net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by changes in the mix of the volume and rates of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table provides an analysis of net interest income on an annualized basis  setting forth for the periods i average assets  liabilities  and shareholders equity  ii interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  iii average yields earned on interest earning assets and average rates on interest bearing liabilities  and iv the banks net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets 
averages are computed based on daily balances 
non accrual loans are included in average loans receivable 
yields are not adjusted for tax equivalency  as the banks had no tax exempt income

the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average total interest earning assets 
republic first bancorp rate volume analysis of changes in net interest income net interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense 
the following table sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in net interest income for the periods indicated 
for purposes of this table  changes in interest income and expense are allocated to volume and rate categories based upon the respective changes in average balances and average rates 
year ended december  year ended december  vs

change due to change due to average average average average dollars in thousands volume rate total volume rate total interest earned on federal funds sold and other interest earning assets securities    loans      total interest earning assets      interest expense of deposits interest bearing demand deposits money market and savings time deposits     total deposit interest expense    other borrowings  total interest expense     net interest income      net interest income the company s net interest margin decreased basis points to for the year ended december  versus the prior year 
the decline reflected the decision to sell a majority of the short term loan outstandings to third parties beginning in the third quarter of  thereby reducing interest income and increasing non interest income 
interest on short term consumer loans contributed approximately million to net interest income in and basis points to the margin  versus million and in excluding the impact of those loans  margins increased to in from in the prior year 
that basis point increase reflected a reduction in the yield paid on interest bearing deposits and other borrowings  which decreased basis points from to growth in non interest bearing demand balances and reductions in rates paid on time deposits certificates of deposits were significant factors in that reduction 
excluding short term loan income  yields on interest earning assets were comparable in and  amounting to and  respectively  in those years 
additionally  maturities of higher rate fhlb advances  which represent the highest cost liabilities on the balance sheet  were also reflected in a lower cost of funds 
a total of million of fhlb advances which carry an average interest rate of began maturing in the third quarter of of the million  all but million had matured by december  that remaining million advance matured in february these advances are repriceable to a significantly lower rate in the current interest rate environment 
excluding short term loan income  loan yields decreased to from 
while the prime rate increased in  most of the impact was experienced in the fourth quarter  minimizing its impact on the full year 
thus  lower commercial loan rates were experienced for most of the year  contributing to the decrease 
notwithstanding that increase in the prime rate  yields on certificates of deposit continued to decrease as renewal rates were lower than previous rates 
the impact of such re pricings and a increase in average non interest bearing deposits were the primary factors in the lower rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
increases in non interest bearing deposits allow the company to lower rates on other accounts 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to for  from in the prior year 
the company s net interest income decreased million  or  to million for year ended december   from million for the prior year 
as shown in the rate volume table above  the decrease in net interest income reflected the impact of participating the majority of short term consumer loans to third parties  beginning in the third quarter of republic first bancorp reductions in these relatively higher rate loans were reflected in the million decrease in interest due to average rate 
interest income on short term loans decreased million  accounting for the majority of that million reduction 
the company s total interest income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
interest and fees on loans decreased million  or  to million for  from million for both of these decreases reflect the million decrease in consumer short term loan interest  which was partially offset by the impact of net average loan growth of million 
the vast majority of such growth was in commercial loans 
the decrease in interest income for short term loans is the principal factor in the decrease in yield on loans of to 
interest and dividend income on securities decreased  or  to million for  from million for the prior year 
this decline was due principally to a lower average rate earned on investment securities  which declined to as higher coupon investments prepaid more rapidly than lower coupon investments and the rates earned on variable rate securities declined due to the lower interest rate environment 
interest income on federal funds sold and other interest earning assets decreased  primarily because average federal funds sold outstanding decreased million to million 
federal funds sold balances were decreased to fund commercial loan growth and the impact of the resulting decreased average balances more than offset the slightly higher market rates available for such investments 
the company s total interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year  as the company reduced the interest rates on certificates of deposit 
the decrease also reflected the growth in of non interest bearing demand deposits 
additionally  average other borrowings decreased million in compared to that reduction was the primary factor resulting in a million decrease in interest expense for other borrowings 
interest bearing liabilities averaged million for the year ended december   versus million for the prior year  reflecting higher amounts of lower cost non interest bearing demand and money market and savings accounts 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to for  due to the decrease in average rates paid on certificates of deposit  and the reduction in higher cost other borrowings primarily fhlb advances which were replaced by lower cost non interest bearing demand and money market and savings accounts 
interest expense on time deposits certificates of deposit decreased million  or  to million for  from million for the prior year 
this decline reflected the repricing of such certificates to lower rates as the average rate declined basis points to 
in addition  average certificates of deposit outstanding decreased million  or  to million  for  from million in the prior year  as higher cost time deposits matured and were not replaced due to the growth in core deposits 
interest expense on other borrowings  primarily fhlb advances  decreased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease resulted from a million decline in average other borrowings to million at december   versus million for the decline in average other borrowings reflected increased non interest bearing demand and savings and money market balances  which replaced higher cost borrowings 
the company issued million of trust preferred securities in november  the expense for which is included in other borrowings expense 
that expense was  for versus  for provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that reflects the known and estimated inherent losses in the portfolio 
the provision for loan losses decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
this decrease reflected a million decrease in provisions primarily related to lower short term loan charge offs which resulted from the sale of such loans to third parties beginning in the third quarter of the reduction in the provision also reflected a million charge off recovery in  which resulted in an excess in the allowance for loan losses 
that excess was recognized as a negative provision for loan losses in the third quarter 
the reduction also reflected a  decrease relating to tax refund loan net charge offs 
non interest income total non interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   versus million for the prior year due primarily to fees earned when short term loans are sold to third parties 
in the third quarter of  the de bank began selling an increased volume of such loans volume generated in texas  michigan  arizona  california  ohio and other states  and via the internet 
such fees increased million  or  to million in primarily due to the increased volume of such sales 
additionally  non interest income reflects a million favorable judgment and related lawsuit damage award  received for damages previously incurred in connection with a loan charge off and subsequent recovery 
fees on tax refund products increased  or in  primarily due to increases in volume 
service fees on deposit accounts increased  or  primarily reflecting increases in the customer base on which republic first bancorp charges are assessed 
other income increased  or  to  in that increase reflected a  increase in bank owned life insurance income  as related balances were outstanding for the full year of  but for only a portion of the prior year 
the balance of the increase resulted primarily from one time charges for special services to a bank customer 
the company also sold one other real estate owned oreo property at a gain of  in the fourth quarter of non interest expenses total non interest expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
salaries and employee benefits increased  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year comparable period 
the increase reflected normal merit and promotional increases which averaged approximately 
occupancy expense increased  or  to million for the year ended december   due primarily to increased rent expense which reflected increased space leased at the main office 
depreciation expense was comparable in both years and amounted to million in legal fees increased  or to million for the year ended december   from  for the prior year 
the increase primarily reflected legal expense related to the spin off of first bank of delaware 
advertising expense was comparable in both years and amounted to  in other real estate owned expense amounted to  in  reflecting the write down of the sole property owned at december  other expense increased million to million in  from million in the prior year 
of that increase   reflected higher correspondent bank fees  primarily due to price increases 
state taxes increased by  as a result of a sales tax audit 
directors fees increased  as a result of the increased number of meetings and rate increases reflecting changes in regulations 
audit fees increased  reflecting both increases in price and audit services  including those related to the spin off 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased million to million for  from million for the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of the increase in pre tax income 
the effective tax rate of for the year ended december  was comparable to the prior year 
results of operations for the years ended december  and overview the company s net income increased million  or  to million or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share for the prior year 
the prior year reflected an after tax write down of one other real estate owned property of  or per diluted share 
the improvement in earnings reflected increases in net interest income and non interest income  a lower commercial loan loss provision and the absence of the oreo write down 
in  net interest income increased million  or  compared to the prior year period 
interest margins in that year continued to be significantly impacted by continued prepayments of the residential real estate and mortgage backed securities portfolios which lowered net interest income 
however  continued reductions in deposit rates and increased short term loan and tax refund product fees more than offset the impact of those prepayments 
the increase in net interest income also reflected the impact of a increase in lower cost average core deposits in compared to the prior year 
the provision for loan losses increased million between those periods primarily reflecting higher charge offs of short term and tax refund loans 
increased net interest income and non interest income from the short term loan and tax refund products more than offset that increase 
in non interest income increased million primarily reflecting increased revenue from the short term loan product resulting from the sale of short term loans to third parties 
non interest expenses net of oreo expense increased reflecting increased depreciation and incentive expenses 
the increased net income resulted in a return on average assets and average equity of

financial condition december  compared to december  total assets increased million to million at december   versus million at december  this net increase reflected higher commercial loans outstanding  partially offset by reduced residential mortgage and mortgage backed securities balances 
loans the loan portfolio  which represents the company s largest asset  is its most significant source of interest income 
the company s lending strategy is to focus on small and medium sized businesses and professionals that seek highly personalized banking services 
total loans increased million  or  to million at december   versus million at december  the increase reflected million  or  of growth in commercial and construction loans versus a million  or  decline in residential mortgage loans resulting primarily from historically high prepayments reflecting the decline in long term mortgage rates 
the loan portfolio consists of secured and unsecured commercial loans including commercial real estate  construction loans  residential mortgages  automobile loans  home improvement loans  short term consumer loans  home equity loans and lines of credit  overdraft lines of credit and others 
the banks commercial loans typically range between  and  but customers may borrow significantly larger amounts up to the banks combined legal lending limit of approximately million at december  individual customers may have several loans that are secured by different collateral 
the aggregate amount of those relationships that exceeded million at december   was million 
the million threshold approximates of total capital and reserves and reflects an additional internal monitoring guideline 
at december   the company through the de bank had million in short term consumer loans outstanding versus million at december  investment securities investment securities available for sale are investments which may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions and for liquidity and other purposes 
the company s investment securities available for sale consist primarily of u 
s government debt securities  us government agency issued mortgage backed securities  and debt securities  which include corporate bonds and trust preferred securities 
available for sale securities totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or   from year end this decrease resulted primarily from historically high principal repayments on mortgage backed securities 
at december  and december   the portfolio had net unrealized gains of  and million  respectively 
investment securities held to maturity are investments for which there is the intent and ability to hold the investment to maturity 
these investments are carried at amortized cost 
the held to maturity portfolio consists primarily of fhlb securities 
at december   securities held to maturity totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from million at year end the decline reflected a reduction in the amount of fhlb stock held 
at both dates  respective carrying values approximated market values 
cash and due from banks cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold comprise this category which consists of the company s most liquid assets 
the aggregate amount in these three categories decreased by million  to million at december   from million at december  federal funds sold decreased by million to million from million  respectively  reflecting the net increase in commercial loan growth 
other interest earning restricted cash republic first bancorp other interest earning restricted cash represents funds provided to fund an offsite atm network for which the company is compensated 
at december   the balance was million versus million at december  fixed assets bank premises and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  increased  or  to million at december   from million at december  the increase reflected investments in telephone and computer equipment  as well as expenditures for new locations 
other real estate owned the oreo property represents retail stores in a strip mall 
the original loan balance was  of which  was charged to the allowance for loan losses in the fourth quarter of resulting in a  balance in other real estate owned 
in the property was additionally written down  for a balance at december  of  business owned life insurance in the second quarter of  the company purchased million of business owned life insurance 
the income earned on these policies is reflected in non interest income 
at december   the value of the insurance was million 
deposits deposits  which include non interest and interest bearing demand deposits  money market  savings and time deposits including some brokered deposits  are the banks major source of funding 
deposits are generally solicited from the company s market area through the offering of a variety of products to attract and retain customers  with a primary focus on multi product relationships 
total deposits increased by million to million at december   from million at december  average core deposits increased or million more than the prior year end to million in time deposits increased million  or  to million at december   versus million at the prior year end 
core deposit growth benefited from the company s business development efforts and bank consolidations in the philadelphia market that continue to leave some customers underserved 
fhlb borrowings and overnight advances fhlb borrowings and overnight advances are used to supplement deposit generation 
fhlb term borrowing by the pa bank totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the company s remaining term borrowing matures in the first quarter of the pa bank also had short term borrowings overnight of million at december  versus million at the prior year end 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased million to million at december   versus million at december  this increase was primarily the result of net income of million 
risks and uncertainties and certain significant estimates the earnings of the company depend on the earnings of the banks 
the banks are dependent primarily upon the level of net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on its interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the interest paid on its interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
accordingly  the operations of the banks are subject to risks and uncertainties surrounding their exposure to change in the interest rate environment 
prepayments on residential real estate mortgages and other fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities vary significantly and may cause significant fluctuations in interest margins 
short term consumer loans were first offered through the de bank in at december   there was approximately million of short term consumer loans outstanding  which were originated in texas 
the de bank also originates loans in michigan  california  arizona  ohio  and via the internet  which are sold to third parties 
the participations sold at december  were million 
legislation eliminating  or limiting interest rates upon short term consumer loans has from time to time been proposed  primarily as a result of fee levels which approximate per borrowed  for two week terms 
if such proposals cease  a larger number of competitors may begin offering the product  and increased competition could result in lower republic first bancorp fees 
further  the de bank uses a small number of marketers under contracts  which can be terminated upon short notice  under various circumstances 
the impact of negative conditions influencing the above factors  if any  is not possible to predict 
the de bank began offering two tax refund products in with liberty tax service 
liberty tax service is a nationwide professional tax service provider which prepares and electronically files federal and state income tax returns tax refund products 
tax refund products consist of accelerated check refunds acrs  and refund anticipation loans rals 
there can be no assurance that revenue levels will increase significantly in future periods 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates are made by management in determining the allowance for loan losses  carrying values of other real estate owned  and income taxes 
consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing these estimates 
in estimating the allowance for loan losses  management considers current economic conditions  diversification of the loan portfolio  delinquency statistics  results of internal loan reviews  borrowers perceived financial and managerial strengths  the adequacy of underlying collateral  if collateral dependent  or present value of future cash flows and other relevant factors 
since the allowance for loan losses and carrying value of real estate owned are dependent  to a great extent  on the general economy and other conditions that may be beyond the banks control  it is at least reasonably possible that the estimates of the allowance for loan losses and the carrying values of the real estate owned could differ materially in the near term 
the company and its subsidiaries are subject to federal and state regulations governing virtually all aspects of their activities  including but not limited to  lines of business  liquidity  investments  the payment of dividends  and others 
such regulations and the cost of adherence to such regulations can have a significant impact on earnings and financial condition 
commitments  contingencies and concentrations the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements 
credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss due to the failure of the other parties to a financial instrument to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract 
the maximum exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
the company uses the same underwriting standards and policies in making credit commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk are commitments to extend credit of approximately million and million and standby letters of credit of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in commitments reflects an increase in commercial lending 
however  commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
the million of commitments to extend credit at december   were substantially all variable rate commitments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and many require the payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include real estate  marketable securities  pledged deposits  equipment and accounts receivable 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued that guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk and collateral policy involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments 
the amount of collateral obtained is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include real estate  marketable securities  pledged deposits  equipment and accounts receivable 
republic first bancorp contractual obligations and other commitments the following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of december  one to three to after less than three five five dollars in thousands total one year years years years minimum annual rentals or noncancellable    operating leases remaining contractual maturities of time      deposits contingent liabilities on equipment benefit plans  loan commitments    long term borrowed funds   standby letters of credit    total      as of december   the company had entered into non cancelable lease agreements for its main office and operations center  nine pa bank retail branch facilities and two de bank retail branches  expiring through september  the leases are accounted for as operating leases 
the minimum annual rental payments required under these leases are million through the year prior to  the company participated in a joint venture with the mbm atm group ltd 
although the company s participation in the venture was terminated  the company remains contingently liable on repayments totaling  through the company has entered into employment agreements with the president of the company and the president of the pa bank 
the aggregate commitment for future salaries and benefits under these employment agreements at december  is approximately million 
the company and the banks are from time to time a party plaintiff or defendant to lawsuits that are in the normal course of business 
while any litigation involves an element of uncertainty  management  after reviewing pending actions with its legal counsel  is of the opinion that the liability of the company and the banks  if any  resulting from such actions will not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company and the banks 
at december   the company had no foreign loans and no loan concentrations exceeding of total loans except for credits extended to real estate operators and lessors in the aggregate amount of million  which represented of gross loans receivable at december  various types of real estate are included in this category  including industrial  retail shopping centers  office space  residential multi family and others 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there is amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities that management believes would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk management involves managing the extent to which interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities are matched 
the company attempts to optimize net interest income while managing period to period fluctuations therein 
the company typically defines interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities as those that reprice within one year or less 
the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities is known as the interest sensitivity gap gap 
a positive gap occurs when interest sensitive assets exceed interest sensitive liabilities repricing in the same time periods  and a negative gap occurs when interest sensitive liabilities exceed interest sensitive assets repricing in the same time periods 
a negative gap ratio suggests that a financial institution may be better positioned to take advantage of declining interest rates rather than increasing interest rates  and a positive gap ratio suggests the converse 
republic first bancorp static gap analysis describes interest rate sensitivity at a point in time 
however  it alone does not accurately measure the magnitude of changes in net interest income since changes in interest rates do not impact all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
interest rate sensitivity analysis also requires assumptions about repricing certain categories of assets and liabilities 
for purposes of interest rate sensitivity analysis  assets and liabilities are stated at either their contractual maturity  estimated likely call date  or earliest repricing opportunity 
mortgage backed securities and amortizing loans are scheduled based on their anticipated cash flow  including prepayments based on historical data and current market trends 
savings  money market and interest bearing demand accounts do not have a stated maturity or repricing term and can be withdrawn or repriced at any time 
management estimates the repricing characteristics of these accounts based on historical performance and other deposit behavior assumptions 
these deposits are not considered to reprice simultaneously and  accordingly  a portion of the deposits are moved into time brackets exceeding one year 
however  management may choose not to reprice liabilities proportionally to changes in market interest rates  for competitive or other reasons 
shortcomings  inherent in a simplified and static gap analysis  may result in an institution with a negative gap having interest rate behavior associated with an asset sensitive balance sheet 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
furthermore  repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given time period 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and other cash flows could also deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating gap in the manner presented in the table below 
the company attempts to manage its assets and liabilities in a manner that optimizes net interest income in a range of interest rate environments 
management uses gap analysis and simulation models to monitor behavior of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
adjustments to the mix of assets and liabilities are made periodically in an effort to provide steady growth in net interest income 
management presently believes that the effect on the banks of any future fall in interest rates  reflected in lower yielding assets  would be detrimental since the banks do not have the immediate ability to commensurately decrease rates on its interest bearing liabilities  primarily time deposits  other borrowings and certain transaction accounts 
an increase in interest rates could have a positive effect on the banks  due to repricing of certain assets  primarily adjustable rate loans and federal funds sold  and a possible lag in the repricing of core deposits not assumed in the model 
the following tables present a summary of the company s interest rate sensitivity gap at december  for purposes of these tables  the company has used assumptions based on industry data and historical experience to calculate the expected maturity of loans because  statistically  certain categories of loans are prepaid before their maturity date  even without regard to interest rate fluctuations

in addition to the gap analysis  the company utilizes income simulation modeling in measuring its interest rate risk and managing its interest rate sensitivity 
income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net interest income  but also other factors such a yield curve relationships  the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and general market conditions 
republic first bancorp through the use of income simulation modeling the company has estimated net interest income for the year ending december   based upon the assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments at december  the company has also estimated changes to that estimated net interest income based upon immediate and sustained changes in interest rates rate shocks 
rate shocks assume that all of the interest rate increases or decreases occur on the first day of the period modeled and remain at that level for the entire period 
the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in estimated net interest income for the years ending december  excluding the impact of short term and tax refund loans 
note the spin off of first bank of delaware is not expected to have a significant impact on the following table 
percent change rate shocks to interest rates the company s management believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating the company s estimated net interest income are reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based 
periodically  the company may and does make significant changes to underlying assumptions  which are wholly judgmental 
prepayments on residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities have increased over historical levels due to the lower interest rate environment  and may result in reductions in margins 
capital resources the company is required to comply with certain risk based capital adequacy guidelines issued by the frb and the fdic 
the risk based capital guidelines assign varying risk weights to the individual assets held by a bank 
the guidelines also assign weights to the credit equivalent amounts of certain off balance sheet items  such as letters of credit and interest rate and currency swap contracts 
under these guidelines  banks are expected to meet a minimum target ratio for qualifying total capital to weighted risk assets of  at least one half of which is to be in the form of tier capital 
qualifying total capital is divided into two separate categories or tiers 
tier capital includes common stockholders equity  certain qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill  tier capital components limited in the aggregate to one half of total qualifying capital includes allowances for credit losses within limits  certain excess levels of perpetual preferred stock and certain types of hybrid capital instruments  subordinated debt and other preferred stock 
applying the federal guidelines  the ratio of qualifying total capital to weighted risk assets  was and at december  and  respectively  and as required by the guidelines  at least one half of the qualifying total capital consisted of tier l capital elements 
tier l risk based capital ratios on december  and were and  respectively 
at december  and  the company exceeded the requirements for risk based capital adequacy under both federal and pennsylvania state guidelines 
under frb and fdic regulations  a bank and a holding company are deemed to be well capitalized when it has a leverage ratio tier l capital to total assets of at least  a tier l capital to weighted risk assets ratio of at least  and a total capital to weighted risk assets ratio of at least

on november   republic first bancorp  inc  through a pooled offering with sandler o neill partners  issued million of corporation obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities of the subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures of the corporation more commonly known as trust preferred securities 
the purpose of the issuance was to increase capital as a result of the company s continued loan and core deposit growth 
the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital for regulatory purposes in amounts up to of total tier capital 
the company may call the securities on any interest payment date after five years  without a prepayment penalty  notwithstanding their final year maturity 
the interest rate is variable and adjustable semi annually at over the month london interbank offered rate libor 
the shareholders equity of the company as of december   totaled approximately million compared to approximately million as of december  this increase of million reflected net income of million 
republic first bancorp that net income increased the book value per share of the company s common stock from as of december   based upon  shares outstanding  to as of december   based upon  shares outstanding at december  regulatory capital requirements federal banking agencies impose three minimum capital requirements on the company s risk based capital ratios based on total capital  tier capital  and a leverage capital ratio 
the risk based capital ratios measure the adequacy of a bank s capital against the riskiness of its assets and off balance sheet activities 
failure to maintain adequate capital is a basis for prompt corrective action or other regulatory enforcement action 
in assessing a bank s capital adequacy  regulators also consider other factors such as interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  funding and market risks  quality and level or earnings  concentrations of credit  quality of loans and investments  risks of any nontraditional activities  effectiveness of bank policies  and management s overall ability to monitor and control risks

  management believes that the company and banks met  as of december  and  all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
as of december   the fdic categorized the banks as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action provisions of the federal deposit insurance act 
there are no calculations or events since that notification  which management believes would have changed the banks category 
after the spin off of first bank of delaware  the company s capital levels will approximate those of the pa bank 
republic first bancorp the company and the banks ability to maintain the required levels of capital is substantially dependent upon the success of their capital and business plans  the impact of future economic events on the banks loan customers and the banks ability to manage their interest rate risk  growth and other operating expenses 
in addition to the above minimum capital requirements  the federal reserve bank approved a rule that became effective on december   implementing a statutory requirement that federal banking regulators take specified prompt corrective action when an insured institution s capital level falls below certain levels 
the rule defines five capital categories based on several of the above capital ratios 
the banks currently exceed the levels required for a bank to be classified as well capitalized 
however  the federal reserve bank may consider other criteria when determining such classifications  which criteria could result in a downgrading in such classifications

liquidity financial institutions must maintain liquidity to meet day to day requirements of depositors and borrowers  time investment purchases to market conditions and provide a cushion against unforeseen needs 
liquidity needs can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities 
the most liquid assets consist of cash  amounts due from banks and federal funds sold 
regulatory authorities require the company to maintain certain liquidity ratios such that the banks maintain available funds  or can obtain available funds at reasonable rates  in order to satisfy commitments to borrowers and the demands of depositors 
in response to these requirements  the company has formed an asset liability committee alco  comprised of certain members of the banks board of directors and senior management  which monitors such ratios 
the purpose of the committee is  in part  to monitor the banks liquidity and adherence to the ratios in addition to managing relative interest rate risk 
the alco meets at least quarterly 
the company s most liquid assets  comprised of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  loan maturities and repayments are another source of asset liquidity 
at december   the pa bank estimated that in excess of million of loans would mature or repay in the six month period ended june  additionally  the majority of its securities are available to satisfy liquidity requirements through pledges to the fhlb to access the pa banks line of credit 
funding requirements have historically been satisfied by generating core deposits and certificates of deposit with competitive rates  buying federal funds or utilizing the facilities of the federal home loan bank system fhlb 
at december   the pa bank had million in unused lines of credit available under arrangements with the fhlb and with correspondent banks  compared to million at december  the reduction in available lines resulted from prepayments of the pa bank s mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage loan portfolio pledged as collateral against those lines 
notwithstanding these reductions  management believes it satisfactorily exceeds regulatory liquidity guidelines 
these lines of credit enable the pa bank to purchase funds for short to long term needs at rates often lower than other sources and require pledging of securities or loan collateral 
at december   the company had outstanding commitments including unused lines of credit and letters of credit of million 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year totaled million at december  the pa bank has million in term fhlb borrowings at december  this amount will mature in these term borrowings are expected to be replaced by overnight borrowings 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current commitments 
in addition  the company can use term borrowings to replace these borrowed funds 
the banks target and actual liquidity levels are determined by comparisons of the estimated repayment and marketability of the banks interest earning assets with projected future outflows of deposits and other liabilities 
the pa bank has established a line of credit with a correspondent bank to assist in managing the pa banks liquidity position 
that line of credit totaled million at december  the pa bank had drawn down on this line at december  additionally  the pa bank has established a line of credit with the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh with a maximum borrowing capacity of approximately million 
that million capacity is reduced by advances outstanding to arrive at the unused line of credit available 
as of december  and  the pa bank had borrowed million and million  respectively republic first bancorp from the fhlb 
investment securities represent a primary source of liquidity for the pa bank 
accordingly  investment decisions generally reflect liquidity over other considerations 
operating cash flows are primarily derived from cash provided from net income during the year and are another source of liquidity 
in  significant cash flows were provided from the maturities and principal paydowns of securities 
the company s primary short term funding sources are certificates of deposit and its securities portfolio 
the circumstances that are reasonably likely to affect those sources are as follows 
the pa bank has historically been able to generate certificates of deposit by matching philadelphia market rates or paying a premium rate of to basis points over those market rates 
it is anticipated that this source of liquidity will continue to be available  however  the incremental cost may vary depending on market conditions 
the company s securities portfolio is also available for liquidity  most likely as collateral for fhlb advances 
because of the fhlb s aaa rating  it is unlikely those advances would not be available 
but even if they are not  numerous investment companies would likely provide repurchase agreements up to the amount of the market value of the securities 
the alco committee is responsible for managing the liquidity position and interest sensitivity of the banks 
that committee s primary objective is to maximize net interest income while configuring the banks interest sensitive assets and liabilities to manage interest rate risk and provide adequate liquidity for projected needs 
investment securities portfolio the banks investment securities portfolio is intended to provide liquidity and contribute to earnings while diversifying credit risk 
the company attempts to maximize earnings while minimizing its exposure to interest rate risk 
the securities portfolio consists primarily of us government agency securities  mortgage backed securities  corporate bonds  trust preferred securities and fhlb stock 
the company s alco monitors and approves all security purchases 
the decline in securities in and was a result of the company s strategy to reduce the amount of the investment securities by not replacing mortgage backed securities prepayments in the lower interest rate environment

loans  including impaired loans  are generally classified as non accrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of interest or principal for a period of more than days  unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than days may also be classified as non accrual if repayment in full of principal and or interest is in doubt 
loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time  and there is a sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower  in accordance with the contractual terms 
while a loan is classified as non accrual or as an impaired loan and the future collectibility of the recorded loan balance is doubtful  collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to principal outstanding 
when the future collectibility of the recorded loan balance is expected  interest income may be recognized on a cash basis 
for non accrual loans which have been partially charged off  recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate 
cash interest receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge offs have been fully recovered

the second loan amounted to million  of which  was charged off and million was transferred to oreo and sold for that amount 
problem loans consist of loans that are included in performing loans  but for which potential credit problems of the borrowers have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to continue to comply with present repayment terms 
at december   all identified problem loans are included in the preceding table  or are classified as substandard or doubtful  with a reserve allocation in the allowance for loan losses see allowance for loan losses 
management believes that the appraisals and other estimates of the value of the collateral pledged against the non accrual loans generally exceed the amount of related balances

excluding short term and tax refund loan charge offs  ratios were  
and in  and  respectively 
the company experienced a million loan loss recovery on a single commercial loan in in  approximately  was collected on that loan  the majority of which was charged off in the company also recovered  in related to another borrower  the majority of whose loan was charged off in in  commercial loan charge offs increased approximately million over the single largest charge off reflected in the increase totaled  as previously discussed under credit quality 
additionally  a total of  of community reinvestment act loans were charged off in the significant increase in short term loan charge offs in reflected greater amounts of loans generated in that year 
however  since the vast majority of such loans are now sold  lower levels of charge offs occurred in charge offs on tax refund loans decreased to  in  from million in  as a result of increased underwriting and other controls 
management makes at least a quarterly determination as to an appropriate provision from earnings to maintain an allowance for loan losses that is management s best estimate of known and inherent losses 
the company s board of directors periodically reviews the status of all non accrual and impaired loans and loans classified by the banks regulators or internal loan review officer  who reviews both the loan portfolio and overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the board of directors also considers specific loans  pools of similar loans  historical charge off activity  economic conditions and other relevant factors in reviewing the adequacy of the loan loss reserve 
any additions deemed necessary to the allowance for loan losses are charged to operating expenses 
republic first bancorp the company has an existing loan review program  which monitors the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis 
loan review is conducted by a loan review officer who reports quarterly  directly to the board of directors 
estimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses at any given date is difficult  particularly in a continually changing economy 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at december  however  there can be no assurance that  if asset quality deteriorates in future periods  additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be required 
the banks management is unable to determine in which loan category future charge offs and recoveries may occur 
the following schedule sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories 
the allocation is accordingly based upon historical experience 
the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb loan losses in any loan category at december  dollars in thousands allocation of the of of of of of allowance for loan amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans losses  commercial      construction  residential real estate consumer and other short term loans unallocated total      gross loans net of unearned income 
includes loans held for sale 
the methodology utilized to estimate the amount of the allowance for loan losses is as follows the company first applies an estimated loss percentage against all loan categories outstanding 
in  excluding short term and tax refund loans  the company experienced net charge offs to average loans of approximately 
net recoveries and net charge offs  respectively  excluding short term and tax refund loans  to average loans were 
and 
in and while in that ratio was  substantially all of the charge offs in and  related to two borrowers 
however  of total charge offs resulting in the 
and 
ratios in and  subsequent collections amounted to of such charge offs 
in the previous three years  the charge off ratio did not exceed 
in the absence of sustained charge off history  management estimates loss percentages based upon the purpose and or collateral of various commercial loan categories 
while such loss percentages exceed the percentages suggested by historical experience  the company maintained those percentages in the company applied historical loss percentages for short term consumer loans and added additional reserves based on industry experience  which in some cases is greater than the company s experience 
the company will continue to evaluate these percentages and may adjust these estimates on the basis of charge off history  economic conditions or other relevant factors 
the company also provides specific reserves for impaired loans to the extent the estimated realizable value of the underlying collateral is less than the loan balance  when the collateral is the only source of repayment 
further  the company attempts to classify any applicable loans according to regulatory definitions  for loans that may have characteristics that may decrease the probability of full compliance with original loan terms 
consistent with regulatory reserve allocations the classifications and percentage of principal which are allocated to the allowance for loan losses are as follows special mention  substandard  and doubtful 
also  the company may estimate and recognize reserve allocations above these regulatory reserve percentages based upon any factor that might impact the loss estimates 
those factors include but are not limited to the impact of economic conditions on the borrower and management s potential alternative strategies for loan or collateral disposition 
in  the unallocated component increased  to  primarily for economic reasons 
at december   based upon some sustained stabilization and improvement in certain economic trends  the unallocated component decreased to  from  at the prior year end 
that decrease resulted notwithstanding that total loans at december   increased to million from million at the prior year end 
the unallocated allowance is established for losses that have not been identified through the formulaic and other specific components of the allowance as described above 
the unallocated portion is more subjective and requires a high degree of management judgment and experience 
management has identified several factors that impact credit losses that are not considered in either the formula or the specific allowance segments 
these factors consist of macro and micro economic conditions  industry and geographic loan concentrations  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  changes in republic first bancorp underwriting processes and trends in problem loan and loss recovery rates 
the impact of the above is considered in light of management s conclusions as to the overall adequacy of underlying collateral and other factors 
the majority of the company s loan portfolio represents loans made for commercial purposes  while significant amounts of residential property may serve as collateral for such loans 
the company attempts to evaluate larger loans individually  on the basis of its loan review process  which scrutinizes loans on a selective basis  and other available information 
even if all commercial purpose loans could be reviewed  there is no assurance that information on potential problems would be available

       variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which voting rights are not effective in identifying the investor with the controlling financial interest 
an entity is subject to consolidation under fin if the investors either do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  are unable to direct the entity s activities  or are not exposed to the entity s losses or entitled to its residual returns variable interest entities 
variable interest entities within the scope of fin will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected returns  or both 
management has determined that republic first capital trust i  utilized for the company s  of pooled trust preferred securities issuance  qualifies as a variable interest entity under fin republic first capital trust i issued mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to investors and loaned the proceeds to the company 
republic first capital trust i holds  as its sole asset  subordinated debentures issued by the company in republic first capital trust i is currently included in the company s consolidated balance sheet and statements of income 
the company has evaluated the impact of fin and concluded it should continue to consolidate republic first capital trust i as of december   in part due to its ability to call the preferred stock prior to the mandatory redemption date and thereby benefit from a decline in required dividend yields 
the company adopted the provisions under the revised interpretation in the first quarter of accordingly  the company no longer consolidates rfct as of march  fin r precludes consideration of the call option embedded in the preferred stock when determining if the company has the right to a majority of rfct s expected residual returns 
the deconsolidation resulted in the investment in the common stock of rfct to be included in other assets as of september  republic first bancorp and the corresponding increase in outstanding debt of  in addition  the income received on the company s common stock investment is included in other income 
the adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations 
the federal reserve has issued final guidance on the regulatory capital treatment for the trust preferred securities issued by rfct as a result of the adoption of fin r 
the final rule would retain the current maximum percentage of total capital permitted for trust preferred securities at  but would enact other changes to the rules governing trust preferred securities that affect their use as part of the collection of entities known as restricted core capital elements 
the rule would take effect march   however  a five year transition period starting march  and leading up to that date would allow bank holding companies to continue to count trust preferred securities as tier capital after applying fin r 
management has evaluated the effects of the final rule and does not anticipate a material impact on its capital ratios

sop applies to a loan with the evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination acquired by completion of a transfer for which it is probable at acquisition  that the company will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable 
sop required that the company recognize the excess of all cash flows expected at acquisition over the investor s initial investment in the loan as interest income on a level yield basis over the life of the loan as the accretable yield 
the loan s contractual required payments receivable in excess of the amount of its cash flows excepted at acquisition nonaccretable difference should not be recognized as an adjustment to yield  a loss accrual or a valuation allowance for credit risk
