item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview harmonic designs  manufactures and sells digital video systems and fiber optic systems that enable network operators to provide a range of interactive and advanced digital services that include digital video  vod  hdtv  high speed internet access and telephony 
our digital video systems enable our customers to process video for distribution over cable  satellite  telephone and wireless networks 
we also provide fiber optic transmission systems to cable television operators and to certain telephone companies that offer video services to their customers 
in order to further expand our digital systems capability  harmonic acquired c cube microsystems inc s divicom business in may  which provided encoding products and systems for digital television 
since the merger  harmonic has been organized into two operating divisions  broadband access networks  or ban  for fiber optic systems and convergent systems  or cs  for digital headend systems 
harmonic s net sales increased in  and decreased in and in although industry capital spending has been generally weak as compared to the pre merger levels achieved by harmonic and divicom in and early  we believe that the sequential quarterly sales increases in and the increase in compared to reflected an improved industry capital spending environment worldwide which favorably impacted harmonic 
we believe that this improvement in the industry capital spending environment is  in part  a result of the intensifying competition between cable and satellite operators to offer more channels of digital video and new services  such as vod and hdtv  and in part  the result of the entry of telephone companies into the business of delivering video services to their subscribers 
we also believe that the improvement is due to more favorable conditions in industry capital markets and the completion or resolution of certain major business combinations  financial restructurings and regulatory issues 
our quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly due to revenue recognition policies and the timing of the receipt of orders 
revenue from two significant customer orders in the third quarter of was delayed due to these factors until the fourth quarter of as a result  we expect revenue in the first quarter of will be sequentially lower than the revenue in the fourth quarter of historically  a majority of our net sales have been to relatively few customers  and due in part to the consolidation of ownership of cable television and direct broadcast satellite systems  we expect this customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future 
in  sales to comcast accounted for of net sales 
in  sales to comcast accounted for of net sales 
in  sales to charter communications and comcast accounted for and of net sales  respectively 
if comcast  which acquired at t broadband in november  and at t broadband had been combined for all of  total sales to the combined entity would have been of net sales 
in   and  sales of ban products accounted for approximately   and of net sales  respectively  while cs products accounted for approximately   and of net sales  respectively 
sales to customers outside of the us in   and represented   and of net sales  respectively 
a significant portion of international sales are made to distributors and system integrators  which are generally responsible for importing the products and providing installation and technical support and service to customers within their territory 
sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately of net sales in and we expect international sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
in  annual growth in net sales of  improved gross margins  and operating expense growth of enabled harmonic to return to profitability 
we reported net income of million in  compared to net losses of million and million in and  respectively 
our operating results in included credits of million for products sold during the year which had been written down in prior years 

table of contents our operating results for included a charge to general and administrative expense of approximately million related to the settlement of litigation with power and telephone supply p t in release of all outstanding claims 
these claims arose from the cancellation of purchase orders on p t by one of its end customers in our operating results for also included credits to operating expenses totaling approximately million from the sale of our bankruptcy claims against adelphia communications resulting in the reversal of previously recorded bad debt provisions  and credits of million for products sold during the year which had been written down in prior years 
in  certain of our domestic and international customers that had accumulated significant levels of debt announced reorganizations and financial restructurings  including bankruptcy filings 
in particular  adelphia communications declared bankruptcy in june  and as a result  we recorded only nominal revenue from adelphia between the first quarter of and the second quarter of and established a million provision in the second quarter of for probable losses on receivables and deferred costs of sales determined to no longer be recoverable 
adelphia has accounted for less than of net sales in each of  and we believe that capital market concerns about the cable industry and the associated pressures on capital spending contributed to the decrease in sales during the second half of compared to the first half of in addition  spending by our domestic satellite customers and european customers was weak in  particularly in the second half of we believe that this was principally because of pending business consolidations  financial restructurings and regulatory issues 
for example  we believe that the regulatory review of the proposed acquisition of directv by echostar depressed spending in  particularly in the second half of although this proposed combination was not completed  the news corporation ltd  subsequently acquired an indirect controlling interest in hughes electronics  the parent of directv  in december as a result of uncertain market conditions and lower sales during the second half of  we implemented a series of cost control measures that included workforce reductions totaling approximately employees during the second half of harmonic recorded severance charges of million during the second half of related to the work force reductions 
this followed a workforce reduction of approximately during for which we recorded severance and other costs of million at the time 
these actions reduced headcount from over  at the end of to at the end of we further reduced headcount to in  mainly by attrition  but the improved business environment in led us to increase headcount to at the end of if business conditions remain favorable  we expect to continue to add to our headcount during in light of our reduced headcount  difficult business conditions  and a weak local commercial real estate market  we reassessed our accrual for the costs of excess facilities and recorded a charge of million during the third quarter of we changed our estimates with regard to the expected timing and amount of sublease income due to the substantial and growing surplus of vacant space in the san francisco bay area 
the excess facilities charge recorded during the third quarter of was for facilities that we no longer occupy  do not intend to occupy  and have subleased  or plan to sublease  and followed charges of million recorded for excess facilities in when the initial accruals were established 
a review performed in the third quarter of resulted in the excess facilities liability being decreased by million due to a revision in the assumptions as to the unoccupied portion of a building 
we removed approximately  square feet of space from the excess facilities portfolio in order to eliminate a third party offsite storage arrangement 
based on the remaining lease term of months  this removal resulted in a reduction of million in the required excess facilities reserve 
this revision was offset by a correction of straight line rent expense of million as a result of a lease extension on another building 
this lease extension was a condition of leasing three additional buildings at corporate headquarters and resulted in all leases terminating in september the deferred rent liability was not adjusted for the change in the lease term resulting in an understatement of rent expense and the deferred rent liability at december   and because the effect of the correction on any quarter or year was not material to these results of operations and financial position  the non cash adjustment was recorded in although we have entered into new subleases for approximately  square feet of space in  in the event we are unable to achieve expected levels of sublease rental income  we will need to revise our estimate of the liability  which could materially impact our financial position  liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 

table of contents harmonic often recognizes a significant portion  or the majority  of its revenues in the last month of the quarter 
harmonic establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of harmonic s business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  the timing of such orders can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
harmonic s expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations  our operating results may be adversely impacted by our inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
in the fourth quarter of  harmonic sold and issued  shares of common stock in a public offering at a price of per share 
the net proceeds to harmonic were approximately million  which was net of underwriters discounts and commissions of approximately million and related legal  accounting  printing and other expenses totaling approximately million 
the net proceeds from the offering are being used for general corporate purposes  including payment of existing liabilities  research and development  the development or acquisition of new products or technologies  equipment acquisitions  strategic acquisitions of businesses  general working capital and operating expenses 
the offering was made pursuant to our registration statement on form s file no 
filed with the sec on march   as amended on april  and as declared effective on april   and the related prospectus supplement filed with the sec on october  the form s registration statement used in this public offering remains effective and harmonic continues to have the ability to issue various types of securities  up to an aggregate of million 
on february   harmonic purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of broadcast technology ltd  a private uk company  for a purchase consideration of million  or approximately million 
the purchase consideration consists of a payment of million in cash and the issuance of  shares of harmonic common stock 
broadcast technology ltd 
develops  manufactures and distributes professional video audio receivers and decoders and has approximately employees 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures requires harmonic to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and expenses if different judgments or different estimates were made 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of harmonic s accounting policies 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates which we believe have the most significant impact on harmonic s financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts  valuation of inventories  impairment of long lived assets  restructuring costs and accruals for excess facilities  assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition harmonic s principal sources of revenue are from sales of hardware products  software products  solution sales  services and hardware and software maintenance agreements 
harmonic recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and risk of loss and title have transferred to the customer 

table of contents we generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
we evaluate our products to assess whether software is more than incidental to a product 
when we conclude that software is more than incidental to a product  we account for the product as a software product 
significant judgment may be required in determining whether a product is a software or hardware product 
revenue from hardware product sales is recognized in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
subject to other revenue recognition provisions  revenue on product sales is recognized when risk of loss and title has transferred  which is generally upon shipment or delivery  based on the terms of the arrangement 
revenue on shipments to distributors  resellers and systems integrators is generally recognized on delivery or sell in 
allowances are provided for estimated returns and discounts 
such allowances are adjusted periodically to reflect actual and anticipated experience 
distributors and systems integrators purchase our products for specific capital equipment projects of the end user and do not hold inventory 
they perform functions that include importation  delivery to the end customer  installation or integration  and post sales service and support 
our agreements with these distributors and systems integrators have terms which are generally consistent with the standard terms and conditions for the sale of our equipment to end users and do not provide for product rotation or pricing allowances  as are typically found in agreements with stocking distributors 
we have long term relationships with most of these distributors and systems integrators and substantial experience with similar sales of similar products 
we have had extensive experience monitoring product returns from our international distributors and accordingly  we have concluded that the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
with respect to these sales  we evaluate the terms of sale and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and risk of loss and title have transferred 
when arrangements contain multiple elements  harmonic evaluates all deliverables in the arrangement at the outset of the arrangement based on the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
if the undelivered elements qualify as separate units of accounting based on the criteria in eitf  which include that the delivered elements have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and that objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for undelivered elements  harmonic allocates the arrangement fee based on the relative fair value of the elements of the arrangement 
if a delivered element does not meet the criteria in eitf to be considered a separate unit of accounting  revenue is deferred until the undelivered elements are fulfilled 
accordingly  the determination as to whether appropriate objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists can impact the timing of revenue recognition for an arrangement 
revenue on solution sales  which principally consist of and include the design  manufacture  test  integration and installation of equipment to the specifications of harmonic s customers  including equipment acquired from third parties to be integrated with harmonic s products  is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position sop accounting for performance of construction production contracts 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue recognized reflects the portion of the anticipated contract revenue that has been earned  equal to the ratio of labor costs expended to date to anticipated final labor costs  based on current estimates of labor costs to complete the project 
if the estimated costs to complete a project exceed the total contract amount  indicating a loss  the entire anticipated loss is recognized 
deferred revenue includes billings in excess of revenue recognized  net of deferred costs of sales 
our application of percentage of completion accounting is subject to our estimates of labor costs to complete each project 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results  financial position or cash flows for a particular period could be adversely affected 
revenue from hardware and software maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
first year maintenance typically is included in the original arrangement and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
services revenue is recognized on performance of the services and costs associated with services are 
table of contents recognized as incurred 
fair value of services such as consulting and training is based upon separate sales of these services 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determination of the revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
because of the concentrated nature of our customer base  different judgments or estimates made for any one large contract or customer could result in material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized in any particular period 
allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts we establish allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts based on credit profiles of our customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions and historical payment  return and discount experience  as well as for known or expected events 
if there were to be a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness or if actual defaults  returns or discounts were higher than our historical experience  our operating results  financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected 
at december   our allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts totaled million 
valuation of inventories harmonic states inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we provide inventory allowances based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
inventory management is of critical importance in order to balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
impairment of goodwill or long lived assets we perform an evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis and of intangibles and other long lived assets whenever we become aware of an event or change in circumstances that would indicate potential impairment 
we evaluate the recoverability of other intangible assets and long lived assets on the basis of undiscounted cash flows from each asset group 
if impairment is indicated  provisions for impairment are determined based on fair value  principally using discounted cash flows 
changes in industry and market conditions or the strategic realignment of our resources could result in an impairment of identified intangibles  goodwill or long lived assets 
there can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
at december   our carrying values for goodwill and intangible assets totaled million and million  respectively 
restructuring costs and accruals for excess facilities for restructuring activities initiated prior to december  we recorded restructuring costs when harmonic committed to an exit plan and significant changes to the exit plan were not likely 
to determine our excess facility accruals we estimate expected sublease rental income on each excess facility 
in the event we are unable to achieve expected levels of sublease rental income  we will need to revise our estimate of the liability which could materially impact our operating results  financial position or cash flows 
at december   our accurals for excess facilities totaled million 
assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation harmonic records accruals for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
based on harmonic s review of the complaints filed in the securities class action and other pending litigation  harmonic believes that it either has meritorious defenses with respect to those actions and claims or is unable to predict the impact of an adverse action and  accordingly  no loss contingencies have been accrued 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will prevail 
an unfavorable outcome 
table of contents of these legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  operating results or cash flows 
accounting for income taxes in preparation of our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current tax exposures and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
based on our judgment that the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income is not assured  we established a valuation allowance of million in which was increased to million in and decreased to million in at december  we have fully reserved for our net deferred tax assets related to temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results and financial position could be materially affected

the cs division sold significantly more encoders in compared to  offset by a reduction in sales of its narrowcast service gateway nsg product for vod due to the substantial completion of initial deployments by certain domestic cable customers 
the increased sales of encoders in was due in part to the major upgrade by a japanese customer of their satellite facilities during  and in part to sales of headend equipment to two major international telephone companies for video deployments 
net sales increased in the ban division in compared to as a result of stronger overall spending by us cable operators resulting in increased sales of transmitters and nodes related to continuing network improvements such as node segmentation  and to a lesser degree by an improvement in spending by international cable operators 
net sales increased in the cs division in compared to  principally due to stronger spending by domestic cable operators in the second half of primarily for the roll out of new services  such as vod 
the decrease in the ban division net sales in compared to was due to reduced capital spending by select cable operators  in particular charter communications and adelphia communications  during the first half of we believe this reduced spending was caused by a tightening of the financial markets  and capital markets concerns about the cable industry in the aftermath of the adelphia bankruptcy filing

these factors  which contributed to higher gross margins in compared to  were partially offset by a reduction in the benefit related to the sale of products for which the cost basis had been written down in prior years 
this benefit was million in  as compared to a benefit of million in we do not expect any substantial benefit in future periods from the sale of products for which the cost basis was written down in prior periods 
there was no change in the amortization of intangibles of million in compared to  however  amortization of intangibles in is expected to decrease by approximately million 
the increase in gross profit in compared to was primarily attributable to a change in the product mix and improvements in factory efficiencies 
also contributing to the higher gross profit in were cost control measures  including the full year effect of reductions in headcount in the factory and technical service and support organizations  associated with work force reductions during the second half of these factors  which contributed to higher gross margins in compared to  were partially offset by lower average selling prices and a reduced benefit of million in compared to million in  related to products sold for which the costs basis had been written down in prior years

harmonic currently expects capital expenditures to be approximately million during on november   harmonic completed a public offering of million shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
the net proceeds were approximately million  which is net of underwriters fees of million  and related legal  accounting  printing and other expenses totaling approximately million 
in connection with this offering  the underwriters exercised their option to purchase million additional shares of common stock at per share on november  to cover over allotments which resulted in additional net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds from the offering are being used for general corporate purposes  including payment of existing liabilities  research and development  the development or acquisition of new products or technologies  equipment acquisitions  strategic acquisitions of businesses  general working capital and operating expenses 
under the terms of the merger agreement with c cube  harmonic is generally liable for c cube s pre merger tax liabilities 
as of december   approximately million of pre merger tax liabilities remained outstanding and are included in accrued liabilities 
harmonic expects to negotiate final settlement and make payment of these obligations to a variety of taxing authorities or to lsi logic during  including a million payment harmonic made in february to settle the tax obligation in one country 
to the extent that these obligations are finally settled for less than the amount provided  harmonic is required  under the terms of the merger agreement  to refund the difference to lsi logic 
accordingly  we expect a significant reduction in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during from these payments 
in the event these liabilities are more than million  lsi is obligated to indemnify harmonic for the additional amount 
harmonic has a bank line of credit facility with silicon valley bank  which provides for borrowings of up to approximately million  including million for equipment under a secured term loan 
this facility  which was amended and restated in december  expires in december and contains financial and other covenants including the requirement for harmonic to maintain unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  net of credit extensions  of not less than million 
if harmonic is unable to maintain this cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance or satisfy the additional affirmative covenant requirements  harmonic would be in noncompliance with the facility 
in the event of noncompliance by harmonic with the covenants under the facility  silicon valley bank would be entitled to exercise its remedies under the facility which include declaring all obligations immediately due and payable  and disposing of the collateral if obligations were not repaid 
at december   harmonic was in compliance with the covenants under this line of credit facility 
an amendment to the line of credit facility entered into during december resulted in harmonic paying a fee of approximately  and requires payment of approximately  of additional fees if harmonic does not maintain an unrestricted deposit of million with silicon valley bank 
future borrowings pursuant to the line bear interest at the bank s prime rate as of december  or prime plus for equipment borrowings 
borrowings are payable monthly and are collateralized by all of harmonic s assets 
as of december   million was outstanding under the equipment term loan portion of this facility and million was borrowed during the term loan is payable monthly  including principal and interest at per annum on outstanding borrowings as of december  and matures at various dates through december other than standby letters of credit and guarantees  there were no other outstanding borrowings or commitments under the line of credit facility as of december  
table of contents harmonic s cash and investment balances at december  were million 
we currently believe that our existing liquidity sources  including the proceeds from the stock offering we completed in the fourth quarter of  and our bank line of credit facility will satisfy our requirements for at least the next twelve months  including the final settlement and payment of c cube s pre merger tax liabilities 
however  we may need to raise additional funds if our expectations or estimates change or prove inaccurate  or to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or to strengthen our financial position 
the completed stock offering in the fourth quarter of was part of a registration statement on form s declared effective by the sec in april the form s registration statement remains effective and harmonic continues to have the ability to use the registration statement to issue various types of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  and warrants to purchase common stock from time to time  up to an aggregate of approximately million  subject to market conditions and our capital needs 
future payments under contractual obligations  and other commercial commitments  as of december   were as follows in thousands payments due by period total amounts over contractual obligations committed year or less years years years operating leases inventory purchase commitments c cube pre merger tax liabilities long term debt interest payments on long term debt foreign currency forward exchange contracts capital lease obligations total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts over other commercial commitments committed year or less years years years standby letters of credit indemnifications guarantees total commercial commitments operating lease commitments include million provided for as accrued excess facilities costs 
harmonic indemnifies some of its suppliers and customers for specified intellectual property rights pursuant to certain parameters and restrictions 
the scope of these indemnities varies  but in some instances  includes indemnification for damages and expenses including reasonable attorneys fees 
there have been no claims for indemnification and  accordingly  no amounts have been accrued in respect of the indemnification provisions at december  in addition  from time to time  we review potential acquisitions that would complement our existing product offerings  enhance our technical capabilities or expand our marketing and sales presence 
any future transaction of this nature could require potentially significant amounts of capital or could require us to issue our stock and dilute existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to harmonic  as well as factors beyond our control  including increased market uncertainty surrounding the ongoing us war on terrorism  as well

new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  to amend the guidance in chapter  inventory pricing  of fasb accounting research bulletin no 
 restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins 
sfas clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage and requires these costs be treated as current period charges 
additionally  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas amends the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  which is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged  with certain exceptions 
sfas amends apb opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of sfas are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not currently believe that sfas will have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations

under sfas r  we will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock based on the grant date fair value with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
the fair value will be estimated using an option pricing model 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of sfas r on our financial statements  including different option pricing models and which transition method to select

in december  fasb staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp fas was issued  providing guidance under sfas  accounting for income taxes for recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of  enacted on october  fsp fas allows time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effects of the jobs act before applying the requirements of fsp fas we are currently in the process of evaluating the potential effects of the jobs act and have not adjusted our tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the requirements of fsp fas factors that may affect future results of operations we depend on cable and satellite industry capital spending for a substantial portion of our revenue and any decrease or delay in capital spending in these industries would negatively impact our resources  operating results and financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents a significant portion of harmonic s sales have been derived from sales to cable television and satellite operators  and we expect these sales to constitute a significant portion of net sales for the foreseeable future 
demand for our products will depend on the magnitude and timing of capital spending by cable television operators  satellite operators  telephone companies and broadcasters for constructing and upgrading their systems 
these capital spending patterns are dependent on a variety of factors  including access to financing  annual budget cycles  the impact of industry consolidation  the status of federal  local and foreign government regulation of telecommunications and television broadcasting  overall demand for communication services and the acceptance of new video  voice and data services  evolving industry standards and network architectures  competitive pressures  including pricing pressures  discretionary customer spending patterns  and general economic conditions 
in the past  specific factors contributing to reduced capital spending have included uncertainty related to development of digital video industry standards  delays associated with the evaluation of new services  new standards  and system architectures by many cable and satellite television operators  emphasis on generating revenue from existing customers by operators instead of new construction or network upgrades  a reduction in the amount of capital available to finance projects of our customers and potential customers  proposed business combinations and divestitures by our customers and regulatory review thereof  economic and financial conditions in domestic and international markets  and bankruptcies and financial restructuring of major customers 
the financial difficulties of certain of our customers and changes in our customers deployment plans adversely affected our business throughout and in the first half of two of our major domestic customers  adelphia communications and winfirst  declared bankruptcy during the first half of  while ntl  a major international customer  emerged from bankruptcy in furthermore  we believe that our net sales to satellite customers were adversely affected by the uncertainty related to the prolonged regulatory review of the proposed acquisition of directv by echostar in  which was ultimately rejected by regulators 
these events  coupled with uncertain and volatile capital markets  also pressured the market values of domestic cable operators and restricted their access to capital 
this reduced access to funding for new and existing customers caused delays in the timing and scale of deployments of our equipment and also resulted in the postponement or cancellation of certain projects by our customers 
several customers also canceled new projects or delayed new orders to allow them to reduce inventory levels that were in excess of their deployment requirements 
we believe that these factors contributed to decreased net sales in both our cs division and our ban division during the second half of and the first half of compared to the first half of we believe that the financial condition of many of our customers has stabilized or improved  and our net sales increased in compared to however  another economic downturn or other factors could cause additional financial difficulties among our customers  and customers whose financial condition has stabilized may not purchase new equipment at levels we have seen in the past 
continued financial difficulties among our customers would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  industry consolidation has  in the past and 
table of contents may in the future  constrain capital spending among our customers 
in this regard  we believe that the proposed sale of adelphia communications and the recent privatization of cox communications have led to capital spending delays at these customers 
we cannot currently predict the impact of the proposed sale of adelphia communications or the privatization of cox communications on our future sales 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will maintain or increase our net sales in the future 
major us cable operators have indicated that the substantial completion of major network upgrades  which involved significant labor and construction costs  will lead to lower capital expenditures in the future 
if our product portfolio and product development plans do not position us well to capture an increased portion of the capital spending of us cable operators  our revenue may decline and our operating results would be adversely affected 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our key customers would harm our business 
historically  a majority of our sales have been to relatively few customers  and due in part to the consolidation of ownership of cable television and direct broadcast satellite systems  we expect this customer concentration to continue in the foreseeable future 
sales to our ten largest customers in   and accounted for approximately  and of net sales  respectively 
although we are attempting to broaden our customer base by penetrating new markets such as the telecommunications and broadcast markets and expand internationally  we expect to see continuing industry consolidation and customer concentration due in part to the significant capital costs of constructing broadband networks 
for example  comcast acquired at t broadband in november  thereby creating the largest us cable operator  reaching approximately million subscribers 
in the dbs segment  the news corporation ltd 
acquired an indirect controlling interest in hughes electronics  the parent company of directv in in addition  the sale or financial restructuring of companies such as adelphia communications and several european operators may lead to further industry consolidation 
in and  sales to comcast accounted for and  respectively  of net sales 
in  sales to charter communications and comcast accounted for and of net sales 
if comcast and at t broadband had been combined for all of  total revenues for the combined entity would have been of net sales 
the loss of comcast or any other significant customer or any reduction in orders by comcast or any significant customer  or our failure to qualify our products with a significant customer could adversely affect our business  operating results and liquidity 
in this regard  sales to comcast declined in compared to  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
the loss of  or any reduction in orders from  a significant customer would harm our business 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future  on an annual and a quarterly basis  as a result of several factors  many of which are outside of our control 
some of the factors that may cause these fluctuations include the level and timing of capital spending of our customers  both in the us and in foreign markets  changes in market demand  the timing and amount of orders  especially from significant customers  the timing of revenue recognition from solution contracts which may span several quarters  the timing of revenue recognition on sales arrangements  which may include multiple deliverables  the need to replace revenue from a major project for a japanese customer that was completed in with other domestic or international customers  competitive market conditions  including pricing actions by our competitors  seasonality  with fewer construction and upgrade projects typically occurring in winter months and otherwise being affected by inclement weather  our unpredictable sales cycles  
table of contents the amount and timing of sales to telcos  which are particularly difficult to predict  new product introductions by our competitors or by us  changes in domestic and international regulatory environments  market acceptance of new or existing products  the cost and availability of components  subassemblies and modules  the mix of our customer base and sales channels  the mix of our products sold  changes in our operating expenses and extraordinary expenses  the impact of fas r  a new accounting standard which requires us to expense stock options  our development of custom products and software  the level of international sales  and economic and financial conditions specific to the cable and satellite industries  and general economic conditions 
for example  the timing of deployment of our equipment can be subject to a number of other risks  including the availability of skilled engineering and technical personnel  the availability of other equipment such as compatible set top boxes  and our customers need for local franchise and licensing approvals 
in addition  we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of the quarter 
we establish our expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
as a result of all these factors  our operating results in one or more future periods may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline 
in this regard  due to lower than expected sales during the third quarter of  the first quarter of  and the third quarter of  we failed to meet our internal expectations  as well as the expectations of securities analysts and investors  and the price of our common stock declined  in some cases significantly 
our future growth depends on market acceptance of several emerging broadband services  on the adoption of new broadband technologies and on several other broadband industry trends 
future demand for our products will depend significantly on the growing market acceptance of several emerging broadband services  including digital video  vod  hd television  very high speed data services and voice over ip voip telephony 
the effective delivery of these services will depend  in part  on a variety of new network architectures  such as fttp networks  new video compression standards such as mpeg h 
and microsoft s windows media broadcast profile vc  the greater use of protocols such as ip  and the introduction of new consumer devices  such as advanced set top boxes and personal video recorders pvrs 
if adoption of these emerging services and or technologies is not as widespread or as rapid as we expect  or if we are unable to develop new products based on these technologies on a timely basis  our net sales growth will be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents furthermore  other technological  industry and regulatory trends will affect the growth of our business 
these trends include the following convergence  or the desire of certain network operators to deliver a package of video  voice and data services to consumers  also known as the triple play  the use of digital video by businesses  governments and educators  the privatization of state owned telcos around the world  efforts by regulators and governments in the us and abroad to encourage the adoption of broadband and digital technologies  and the extent and nature of regulatory attitudes towards such issues as competition between operators  access by third parties to networks of other operators  and new services such as voip 
if  for instance  operators do not pursue the triple play as aggressively as we expect  our net sales growth would be materially and adversely affected 
similar  if our expectations regarding these and other trends are not met  our net sales may be materially and adversely affected 
we need to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner to remain competitive 
broadband communications markets are characterized by continuing technological advancement  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
to compete successfully  we must design  develop  manufacture and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability 
however  we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce these products if our products are not cost effective  are not brought to market in a timely manner  are not in accordance with evolving industry standards and architectures  fail to achieve market acceptance  or are ahead of the market 
also  to successfully develop and market certain of our planned products for digital applications  we may be required to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into any necessary technology development or licensing agreement on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the failure to enter into technology development or licensing agreements when necessary could limit our ability to develop and market new products and  accordingly  could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
our cs division is currently developing and marketing products based on new video compression standards 
encoding products based on the current mpeg compression standards have represented a significant portion of the company s sales since the acquisition of divicom in new standards  such as mpeg h 
and microsoft s windows media broadcast profile vc  are being adopted which are expected to provide significantly greater compression efficiency  thereby making more bandwidth available to operators 
harmonic is developing products based on these new standards in order to remain competitive and is devoting considerable resources to this effort 
there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful in the near future  or at all 
our ban division is currently marketing products for fttp networks which telcos have begun to build 
although we believe that a number of our existing products can be deployed successfully in these networks  we will need to devote considerable resources to obtaining orders  qualifying our products and hiring knowledgeable personnel  and we may make significant financial commitments 
there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful in the near future  or at all 

table of contents if sales forecasted for a particular period are not realized in that period due to the unpredictable sales cycles of our products  our operating results for that period will be harmed 
the sales cycles of many of our products  particularly our newer products and products sold internationally  are typically unpredictable and usually involve a significant technical evaluation  a commitment of capital and other resources by cable  satellite  and other network operators  time required to engineer the deployment of new technologies or new broadband services  testing and acceptance of new technologies that affect key operations  and test marketing of new services with subscribers 
for these and other reasons  our sales cycles generally last three to six months  but can last up to months 
if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter do not occur in that quarter  our operating results for that quarter could be substantially lower than anticipated 
in this regard  our sales cycles with our current and potential telco customers are particularly unpredictable 
additionally  orders may include multiple elements  the timing of delivery of which may impact the timing of revenue recognition 
quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly due to revenue recognition policies and the timing of the receipt of orders 
for example  revenue from two significant customer orders in the third quarter of was delayed due to these factors until the fourth quarter of in addition  a significant portion of our revenue is derived from solution sales that principally consist of and include the system design  manufacture  test  installation and integration of equipment to the specifications of harmonic s customers  including equipment acquired from third parties to be integrated with harmonic s products 
revenue forecasts for solution contracts are based on the estimated timing of the system design  installation and integration of projects 
because the solution contracts generally span several quarters and revenue recognition is based on progress under the contract  the timing of revenue is difficult to predict and could result in lower than expected revenue in any particular quarter 
we depend on our international sales and are subject to the risks associated with international operations  which may negatively affect our operating results 
sales to customers outside of the us in  and represented  and of net sales  respectively  and we expect that international sales will continue to represent a meaningful portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
furthermore  a substantial portion of our contract manufacturing occurs overseas 
our international operations  the international operations of our contract manufacturers  and our efforts to increase sales in international markets  are subject to a number of risks  including changes in foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards  import and export license requirements  tariffs  taxes and other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  treaties and technical standards  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  political and economic instability  and changes in economic policies by foreign governments during  a significant percentage of our international revenues were derived from a major upgrade by a japanese customer of its satellite facilities 
that upgrade has now been completed  and we expect sales to this customer to decline in  which could adversely affect our sales to international customers 

table of contents certain of our international customers have accumulated significant levels of debt and have announced during the past three years  reorganizations and financial restructurings  including bankruptcy filings 
even if these restructurings are completed  we cannot assure you that these customers will be in a position to purchase new equipment at levels we have seen in the past 
while our international sales and operating expenses have typically been denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
following implementation of the euro in january  a higher portion of our european business is denominated in euros  which may subject us to increased foreign currency risk 
gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in operating results 
furthermore  payment cycles for international customers are typically longer than those for customers in the us unpredictable sales cycles could cause us to fail to meet or exceed the expectations of security analysts and investors for any given period 
in addition  foreign markets may not develop in the future 
any or all of these factors could adversely impact our business and results of operations 
pending business combinations and other financial and regulatory issues among our customers could adversely affect our business 
the telecommunications industry has been particularly impacted by the recent economic recession  adverse conditions in capital markets and financial difficulties in both the service and equipment sectors  including bankruptcies 
many of our domestic and international customers accumulated significant levels of debt and announced reorganizations and financial restructurings during the past three years  including bankruptcy filings 
in particular  adelphia communications  a major domestic cable operator  declared bankruptcy in june the stock prices of other domestic cable companies came under pressure following the adelphia bankruptcy due to concerns about debt levels and capital expenditure requirements for new and expanded services  thereby making the raising of capital more difficult and expensive 
new operators  such as rcn and winfirst  also had difficulty in accessing capital markets 
both subsequently filed for bankruptcy 
in europe  rapid consolidation of the cable industry through acquisition also led to significant levels of debt at the major msos  and companies such as ntl and upc went through bankruptcy proceedings 
european digital broadcasters  such as itv digital  kirsch and quiero  also filed for protection from creditors 
while the capital market concerns about the domestic cable industry have eased  market conditions remain difficult and capital spending plans are generally constrained 
it is likely that further industry restructuring will take place via mergers or spin offs  such as the comcast at t broadband transaction in and the acquisition by the news corporation ltd 
in december of an indirect controlling interest in hughes electronics  the parent company of directv 
this transaction followed regulatory opposition to the proposed acquisition of directv by echostar 
we believe that uncertainty during regarding the proposed directv and echostar merger adversely affected capital spending by both of these parties as well as other customers 
more recently  restructuring of the industry has continued with the privatization of cox communications  the planned sale of adelphia communications out of bankruptcy  and the proposed sale of cablevision s voom satellite assets to echostar 
in addition  further business combinations may occur in our industry  and these further combinations could adversely affect our business 
regulatory issues  financial concerns and business combinations among our customers are likely to significantly affect the industry  its capital spending plans  and our levels of business for the foreseeable future 
changes in telecommunications regulations could harm our prospects and future sales 
changes in telecommunications regulations in the us and other countries could affect the sales of our products 
in particular  regulations dealing with access by competitors to the networks of incumbent operators could slow or stop additional construction or expansion by these operators 
increased regulation of our customers pricing or service offerings could limit their investments and consequently the sales of our products 
changes in regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 

table of contents competition for qualified personnel  particularly management personnel  can be intense 
in order to manage our growth  we must be successful in addressing management succession issues and attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
our future success will depend  to a significant extent  on the ability of our management to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
we must successfully manage transition and replacement issues that may result from the departure or retirement of members of our senior management 
we are dependent on our ability to retain and motivate high caliber personnel  in addition to attracting new personnel 
competition for qualified management  technical and other personnel can be intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
competitors and others have in the past and may in the future attempt to recruit our employees 
while our employees are required to sign standard agreements concerning confidentiality and ownership of inventions  we generally do not have employment contracts or non competition agreements with any of our personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly senior management and engineers and other technical personnel  could negatively affect our business 
recent and proposed regulations related to equity compensation could adversely affect earnings  affect our ability to raise capital and affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
since our inception  we have used stock options as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages 
we believe that our stock option plans are an essential tool to link the long term interests of stockholders and employees  especially executive management  and serve to motivate management to make decisions that will  in the long run  give the best returns to stockholders 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has announced changes to us gaap  effective for fiscal periods beginning after june   that will require us to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan rights 
this regulation will negatively impact our earnings and may affect our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms 
in addition  new regulations implemented by the nasdaq national market requiring stockholder approval for all stock option plans could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  we may incur increased compensation costs  change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
we are exposed to additional costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards 
we are spending an increased amount of management time and external resources to comply with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq stock market rules 
particularly  section of the sarbanes oxley act requires management s annual review and evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting  and attestation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting by management and the company s independent registered public accounting firm in connection with the filing of this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   and with each subsequently filed annual report on form k 
we have documented and tested our internal control systems and procedures and have made improvements in order for us to comply with the requirements of section this process required us to hire additional personnel and outside advisory services and has resulted in significant additional accounting and legal expenses 
while our assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting resulted in our conclusion that as of december   our internal control over financial reporting was effective  we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods 
if we conclude in future periods that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective or if our independent registered public accountants are unable to provide an unqualified opinion as of future year ends  investors may lose confidence in our financial statements  and the price of our stock may suffer 

table of contents we may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us 
we have generated substantial operating losses since we began operations in june although we generated a small net profit in after several years of losses  future profitability is highly uncertain  and we may never achieve sustained profitable operations 
we have been engaged in the design  manufacture and sale of a variety of broadband products since inception  which has required  and will continue to require  significant research and development expenditures 
as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of billion 
these losses  among other things  have had and may have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital 
we believe that the proceeds of the stock offering we completed in november  together with our existing liquidity sources  will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months  including the final settlement and payment of c cube s pre merger tax liabilities 
however  we may need to raise additional funds if our expectations are incorrect  to fund our operations  to take advantage of unanticipated strategic opportunities or to strengthen our financial position 
the stock offering we completed in november related to a registration statement on form s declared effective by the sec in april this registration statement will continue to allow harmonic to issue various types of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants to purchase common stock from time to time  up to an aggregate of approximately million  subject to market conditions and our capital needs 
our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to harmonic  as well as factors beyond our control  including conditions in capital markets and the cable  telecom and satellite industries 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  from time to time  we review potential acquisitions that would complement our existing product offerings  enhance our technical capabilities or expand our marketing and sales presence 
any future transaction of this nature could require potentially significant amounts of capital to finance the acquisition and related expenses as well as to integrate operations following a transaction  and could require us to issue our stock and dilute existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
we may raise additional financing through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or products  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we will not be able to continue developing our products 
if demand for our products increases more quickly than we expect  we may be unable to meet our customers requirements 
our net sales increased approximately in from if demand for our products continues to increase  the difficulty of accurately forecasting our customers requirements and meeting these requirements will increase 
forecasting to meet customers needs is particularly difficult in connection with newer products 
our ability to meet customer demand depends significantly on the availability of components and other materials as well as the ability of our contract manufacturers to scale their production 
furthermore  we purchase several key components  subassemblies and modules used in the manufacture or integration of our products from sole or limited sources 
our ability to meet customer requirements depends in part on our ability to obtain sufficient volumes of these materials in a timely fashion 
also  in recent years  in response to lower net sales and the prolonged economic recession  we significantly reduced our headcount and other expenses 
as a result  we may be unable to respond to customer demand that increases more quickly than we expect 
if we fail to meet customers supply expectations  our net sales would be adversely affected and we may lose business 

table of contents we must be able to manage expenses and inventory risks associated with meeting the demand of our customers 
if actual orders are materially lower than the indications we receive from our customers  our ability to manage inventory and expenses may be affected 
if we enter into purchase commitments to acquire materials  or expend resources to manufacture products  and such products are not purchased by our customers  our business and operating results could suffer 
in this regard  our gross margins and operating results have been in the past adversely affected by significant provisions for excess and obsolete inventories 
we face risks associated with having important facilities and resources located in israel 
harmonic maintains a facility in caesarea in the state of israel with a total of employees as of december   or approximately of our workforce 
the employees at this facility consist principally of research and development personnel involved in development of certain products for the cs division 
in addition  we have pilot production capabilities at this facility consisting of procurement of subassemblies and modules from israeli subcontractors and final assembly and test operations 
accordingly  we are directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel  and any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its trading partners could significantly harm our business 
the september terrorist attacks  the ongoing us war on terrorism and the terrorist attacks and hostilities within israel have heightened these risks 
we cannot assure you that current tensions in the middle east will not adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  most of our employees in israel are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and several have been called for active military duty recently 
we cannot predict the effect of these obligations on harmonic in the future 
the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and many of our competitors are larger and more established 
the markets for cable television fiber optics systems and digital video broadcasting systems are extremely competitive and have been characterized by rapid technological change and declining average selling prices 
pressure on average selling prices was particularly severe during the recent economic downturn as equipment suppliers competed aggressively for customers reduced capital spending 
harmonic s competitors in the fiber optics systems business include corporations such as c cor  motorola  and scientific atlanta 
in the digital and video broadcasting systems business  we compete broadly with vertically integrated system suppliers including motorola  scientific atlanta  tandberg television and thomson multimedia  and in certain product lines with cisco and a number of smaller companies 
many of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than harmonic 
many of these large organizations are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by customers in these markets 
they often have broader product lines and market focus and may not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market 
in addition  many of our competitors have been in operation longer than we have and therefore have more long standing and established relationships with domestic and foreign customers 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future  which may harm our business 
if any of our competitors products or technologies were to become the industry standard  our business could be seriously harmed 
for example  new standards for video compression are being introduced and products based on these standards are being developed by harmonic and certain competitors 
if our competitors are successful in bringing these products to market earlier  or if these products are more technologically capable than ours  then our sales could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  companies that have historically not had a large presence in the broadband communications equipment market have begun recently to expand their market share through mergers and acquisitions 
the continued consolidation of our competitors could have a significant negative impact on us 
further  our competitors  particularly competitors of our digital and video broadcasting systems business  may bundle their products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products or which may require us to lower our selling prices resulting in lower gross margins 

table of contents broadband communications markets are characterized by rapid technological change 
broadband communications markets are relatively immature  making it difficult to accurately predict the markets future growth rates  sizes or technological directions 
in view of the evolving nature of these markets  it is possible that cable television operators  telephone companies or other suppliers of broadband wireless and satellite services will decide to adopt alternative architectures or technologies that are incompatible with our current or future products 
also  decisions by customers to adopt new technologies or products are often delayed by extensive evaluation and qualification processes and can result in delays in sales of current products 
if we are unable to design  develop  manufacture and sell products that incorporate or are compatible with these new architectures or technologies  our business will suffer 
we purchase several key components  subassemblies and modules used in the manufacture or integration of our products from sole or limited sources  and we are increasingly dependent on contract manufacturers 
many components  subassemblies and modules necessary for the manufacture or integration of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
for example  we depend on lsi logic for video encoding chips 
our reliance on sole or limited suppliers  particularly foreign suppliers  and our increased reliance on subcontractors since the merger with c cube involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components  subassemblies or modules and reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery of components  subassemblies or modules 
in particular  certain optical components have in the past been in short supply and are available only from a small number of suppliers  including sole source suppliers 
while we expend resources to qualify additional optical component sources  consolidation of suppliers in the industry and the small number of viable alternatives have limited the results of these efforts 
we do not generally maintain long term agreements with any of our suppliers 
managing our supplier and contractor relationships is particularly difficult during time periods in which we introduce new products and during time periods in which demand for our products is increasing  especially if demand increases more quickly than we expect 
furthermore  from time to time we assess our relationship with our contract manufacturers 
in late  we entered into a three year agreement with plexus services corp 
as our primary contract manufacturer 
we completed the transition during the summer of difficulties in managing relationships with current contract manufacturers  could impede our ability to meet our customers requirements and adversely affect our operating results 
an inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply could negatively affect our ability to ship our products on a timely basis  which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our business 
we attempt to limit this risk by maintaining safety stocks of certain components  subassemblies and modules 
as a result of this investment in inventories  we have in the past and in the future may be subject to risk of excess and obsolete inventories  which could harm our business  operating results  financial position and liquidity 
in this regard  our gross margins and operating results in the past  were adversely affected by significant excess and obsolete inventory charges 
we need to effectively manage our operations and the cyclical nature of our business 
the cyclical nature of our business has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our personnel  management and other resources 
this strain was exacerbated by the acquisition of divicom and the subsequent loss of numerous employees  including senior management 
in addition  we reduced our work force by approximately between december  and december  due to reduced industry spending and demand for our products 
if demand for products increases significantly  we may need to increase our headcount  as we did during  adding employees 
our ability to manage our business effectively in the future  including any future growth  will require us to train  motivate and manage our employees successfully  to attract and integrate new employees into our overall operations  to retain key employees and to continue to improve our operational  financial and management systems 
we may be materially affected by the weee and rohs directives 
the european union has finalized the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directive  which regulates the collection  recovery  and recycling of waste from electrical and electronic products  and the restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs directive  which bans the use of 
table of contents certain hazardous materials including lead  mercury  cadmium  chromium  and halogenated flame retardants 
under weee  we will be responsible for financing operations for the collection  treatment  disposal  and recycling of past and future covered products 
because the specific legal requirements have not been finalized  we are presently unable to reasonably estimate the amount of any costs that may be necessary in order to comply with weee 
we cannot assure you that compliance with weee and rohs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we are liable for c cube s pre merger tax liabilities  including tax liabilities resulting from the spin off of its semiconductor business 
under the terms of the merger agreement with c cube  harmonic is generally liable for c cube s pre merger tax liabilities 
as of december   approximately million of pre merger tax liabilities remained outstanding and are included in accrued liabilities 
we are working with lsi logic  which acquired c cube s spun off semiconductor business in june and assumed its obligations  to develop an approach to settle these obligations  a process which has been underway since the merger in these liabilities represent estimates of c cube s pre merger tax obligations to various tax authorities in countries 
harmonic paid a further million of these tax obligations in february  but is unable to predict when the remaining tax obligations will be paid  or in what amount 
the full amount of the estimated obligation has been classified as a current liability 
to the extent that these obligations are finally settled for less than the amounts provided  harmonic is required  under the terms of the merger agreement  to refund the difference to lsi logic 
conversely  if the settlements are more than the million pre merger tax liability after the february payments  lsi logic is obligated to reimburse harmonic 
the merger agreement stipulates that harmonic will be indemnified by the spun off semiconductor business if the cash reserves are not sufficient to satisfy all of c cube s tax liabilities for periods prior to the merger 
if for any reason  the spun off semiconductor business does not have sufficient cash to pay such taxes  or if there are additional taxes due with respect to the non semiconductor business and harmonic cannot be indemnified by lsi logic  harmonic generally will remain liable  and such liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be subject to risks associated with other acquisitions 
we have made  continue to consider making and may make investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
for example  on february   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of broadcast technologies ltd  a private uk company 
in connection with this and other acquisition transactions  we could have difficulty assimilating or retaining the acquired companies key personnel and operations  integrating the acquired technology or products into ours or complying with internal control requirements of the sarbanes oxley act as a result of an acquisition 
we also may face challenges in achieving the strategic objectives  cost savings or other benefits from these proposed acquisitions and difficulties in expanding our management information systems to accommodate the acquired business 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and significantly increase our expenses 
moreover  our operating results may suffer because of acquisition related expenses  amortization of intangible assets and impairment of acquired goodwill or intangible assets 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions  or to provide for additional working capital requirements  the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks  our business  financial condition or operating results could be harmed 
cessation of the development and production of video encoding chips by c cube s spun off semiconductor business may adversely impact us 
the divicom business and c cube semiconductor business acquired by lsi logic in june collaborated on the production and development of two video encoding microelectronic chips prior to the merger 
in connection with the merger  harmonic and the spun off semiconductor business entered into a contractual relationship under which harmonic has access to certain of the spun off semiconductor business technologies and products which the divicom business previously depended for its product and service offerings 
the current term of this agreement is through october  with automatic annual renewal unless terminated by either party in accordance with the 
table of contents agreement provisions 
the spun off semiconductor business is the sole supplier of these chips to harmonic 
several of these products continue to be important to our business  and we have incorporated these chips into additional products that we have developed 
if the spun off semiconductor business is not able to or does not sustain its development and production efforts in this area our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow could be harmed 
our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights may adversely affect us 
we currently hold issued us patents and issued foreign patents  and have a number of patent applications pending 
although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  trademarks  copyrights  licensing arrangements  maintaining certain technology as trade secrets and other measures  we cannot assure you that any patent  trademark  copyright or other intellectual property rights owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that such intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
we cannot assure you that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents that we own 
in addition  effective patent  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries in which we do business or may do business in the future 
we believe that patents and patent applications are not currently significant to our business  and investors therefore should not rely on our patent portfolio to give us a competitive advantage over others in our industry 
we believe that the future success of our business will depend on our ability to translate the technological expertise and innovation of our personnel into new and enhanced products 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  vendors and customers as needed  and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology 
in addition  we have taken in the past  and may take in the future  legal action to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business  operating results  financial position or cash flows 
in order to successfully develop and market certain of our planned products for digital applications  we may be required to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties 
although many companies are often willing to enter into technology development or licensing agreements  we cannot assure you that such agreements will be negotiated on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the failure to enter into technology development or licensing agreements  when necessary  could limit our ability to develop and market new products and could cause our business to suffer 
we or our customers may face intellectual property infringement claims from third parties 
harmonic s industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in particular  leading companies in the telecommunications industry have extensive patent portfolios 
from time to time  third parties  including these leading companies  have asserted and may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights against us or our customers 
indeed  a number of third parties  including leading companies  have asserted patent rights to technologies that are important to us 
on july   stanford university and litton systems filed a complaint in us district court for the central district of california alleging that optical fiber amplifiers incorporated into certain of harmonic s products infringe us patent no 
 this patent expired in september the complaint seeks injunctive relief  royalties and damages 
harmonic has not been served in the case 
harmonic continues to evaluate its position with respect to this patent and has engaged in discussions with the plaintiff regarding potential settlement of the matter 
at this time  harmonic is unable to determine whether harmonic will be able to settle this matter on reasonable terms or at all  nor can harmonic predict the impact of an adverse outcome of this litigation if harmonic elects to defend against it 
consequently  harmonic has made no provision in its financial statements for the outcome of a negotiated 
table of contents settlement or an unfavorable verdict in litigation 
an unfavorable outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on harmonic s business  operating results  financial position or cash flows 
our suppliers and customers may receive similar claims 
we have agreed to indemnify some of our suppliers and customers for alleged patent infringement 
the scope of this indemnity varies  but  in some instances  includes indemnification for damages and expenses including reasonable attorney s fees 
we are the subject of securities class action claims and other litigation which  if adversely determined  could harm our business and operating results 
between june and august   several actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws by harmonic and certain of its officers and directors some of whom are no longer with harmonic were filed in or removed to the us district court for the northern district of california 
the actions subsequently were consolidated 
a consolidated complaint  filed on december   was brought on behalf of a purported class of persons who purchased harmonic s publicly traded securities between january and june  the complaint also alleged claims on behalf of a purported subclass of persons who purchased c cube securities between january and may  in addition to harmonic and certain of its officers and directors  the complaint also named c cube microsystems inc and several of its officers and directors as defendants 
the complaint alleged that  by making false or misleading statements regarding harmonic s prospects and customers and its acquisition of c cube  certain defendants violated sections b and a of the securities exchange act of the complaint also alleged that certain defendants violated section a of the exchange act and sections  a  and of the securities act of by filing a false or misleading registration statement  prospectus  and joint proxy in connection with the c cube acquisition 
on july   the court dismissed the consolidated complaint with leave to amend 
an amended complaint alleging the same claims against the same defendants was filed on august  defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on september  on november   the court issued an opinion granting the motions to dismiss the amended complaint without leave to amend 
judgment for defendants was entered on december  on december   plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the judgment and for leave to file an amended complaint pursuant to rules e and a of the federal rules of civil procedure 
on june   the court denied plaintiffs motion to amend the judgment and for leave to file an amended complaint 
plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on july  the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit heard oral arguments on february   but has not ruled on the appeal yet 
a derivative action purporting to be on behalf of harmonic was filed against its then current directors in the superior court for the county of santa clara on september  harmonic also was named as a nominal defendant 
the complaint is based on allegations similar to those found in the securities class action and claims that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by  among other things  causing harmonic to violate federal securities laws 
the derivative action was removed to the us district court for the northern district of california on september  all deadlines in this action were stayed pending resolution of the motions to dismiss the securities class action 
on july   the court approved the parties stipulation to dismiss this derivative action without prejudice and to toll the applicable limitations period 
the limitations period is tolled until fourteen days after defendants provide plaintiff with a copy of the mandate issued by the ninth circuit in the securities action or either party provides written notice of termination of the tolling period  whichever is first 
a second derivative action purporting to be on behalf of harmonic was filed in the superior court for the county of santa clara on may  it alleges facts similar to those previously alleged in the securities class action and the federal derivative action 
the complaint names as defendants former and current harmonic officers and directors  along with former officers and directors of c cube microsystems  inc  who were named in the securities class action 
the complaint also names harmonic as a nominal defendant 
the complaint alleges claims for abuse of control  gross mismanagement  and waste of corporate assets against the harmonic defendants  and claims for breach of fiduciary duty  unjust enrichment  and negligent misrepresentation against all defendants 
on july   the court approved the parties stipulation to stay the case pending resolution of the appeal in the securities class action 
although the parties initially agreed in principle to a dismissal without prejudice on similar terms as in the federal 
table of contents derivative action  after further discussion  the parties decided that the stay currently in place suffices to protect their respective interests 
based on its review of the complaints filed in the securities class action  harmonic believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously 
there can be no assurance  however  that harmonic will prevail 
no estimate can be made of the possible range of loss associated with the resolution of this contingency and accordingly  harmonic has not recorded a liability 
an unfavorable outcome of this litigation could have a material adverse effect on harmonic s business  operating results  financial position or cash flows 
on july   stanford university and litton systems filed a complaint in us district court for the central district of california alleging that optical fiber amplifiers incorporated into certain of harmonic s products infringe us patent no 
 this patent expired in september the complaint seeks injunctive relief  royalties and damages 
harmonic has not been served in the case 
harmonic is currently evaluating its position with respect to this patent and has engaged in discussions with the plaintiff regarding potential settlement of the matter 
at this time  we are unable to determine whether we will be able to settle this litigation on reasonable terms or at all  nor can we predict the impact of an adverse outcome of this litigation if we elect to defend against it 
no estimate can be made of the possible range of loss associated with the resolution of this contingency and accordingly  we have not recorded a liability associated with the outcome of a negotiated settlement or an unfavorable verdict in litigation 
an unfavorable outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on harmonic s business  operating results  financial position or cash flows 
the terrorist attacks of and the ongoing threat of terrorism have created great uncertainty and may continue to harm our business 
current conditions in the us and global economies are uncertain 
the terrorist attacks in created many economic and political uncertainties that have severely impacted the global economy 
we experienced a further decline in demand for our products after the attacks 
the long term effects of the attacks  the situation in iraq and the ongoing war on terrorism on our business and on the global economy remain unknown 
moreover  the potential for future terrorist attacks has created additional uncertainty and makes it difficult to estimate how quickly the us and other economies will recover and our business will improve 
we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations  and any electrical and natural gas crisis could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
we rely on a continuous power supply for manufacturing and to conduct our business operations 
interruptions in electrical power supplies in california in the early part of could recur in the future 
in addition  the cost of electricity and natural gas has risen significantly 
power outages could disrupt our manufacturing and business operations and those of many of our suppliers  and could cause us to fail to meet production schedules and commitments to customers and other third parties 
any disruption to our operations or those of our suppliers could result in damage to our current and prospective business relationships and could result in lost revenue and additional expenses  thereby harming our business and operating results 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past  and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of technology companies have been especially volatile 
investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above their purchase price 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 

table of contents some anti takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan  as well as provisions of delaware law  could impair a takeover attempt 
harmonic has provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws  each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by the harmonic board of directors 
these include provisions authorizing blank check preferred stock  which could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to harmonic common stock  limiting the liability of  and providing indemnification to  directors and officers  limiting the ability of harmonic stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings  requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of harmonic stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to the harmonic board of directors  controlling the procedures for conduct and scheduling of board and stockholder meetings  and providing the board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings 
these provisions  alone or together  could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control or management of harmonic 
in addition  harmonic has adopted a stockholder rights plan 
the rights are not intended to prevent a takeover of harmonic  and we believe these rights will help harmonic s negotiations with any potential acquirers 
however  if the board of directors believes that a particular acquisition is undesirable  the rights may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging that acquisition 
the rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire harmonic on terms or in a manner not approved by the harmonic board of directors  except pursuant to an offer conditioned upon redemption of the rights 
as a delaware corporation  harmonic also is subject to provisions of delaware law  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prevents some stockholders holding more than of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 
any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws  our stockholder rights plan or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for harmonic stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of harmonic common stock  and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for harmonic common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the operating results  financial position  or liquidity of harmonic due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
harmonic is exposed to market risk because of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and currencies of harmonic s subsidiaries 
foreign currency exchange risk harmonic has a number of international subsidiaries each of whose sales are generally denominated in us dollars 
sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately of net sales in in addition  the company has various international branch offices that provide sales support and systems integration services 
periodically  harmonic enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts to manage exposure related to accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
harmonic does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
at december   we had a forward exchange contract to sell euros totaling million that matures within the first quarter of while harmonic does not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on harmonic s operating results  financial position and liquidity  harmonic 
table of contents cannot assure you that a sudden and significant change in the value of local currencies would not harm harmonic s operating results  financial position and liquidity 
interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to harmonic s investment portfolio of marketable debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities and to harmonic s borrowings under its bank line of credit facility 
harmonic does not use derivative instruments in its investment portfolio  and its investment portfolio only includes highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of less than two years 
these investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at estimated fair value  with material unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income 
there is risk that losses could be incurred if harmonic were to sell any of its securities prior to stated maturity 
a change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on financial conditions  results of operations or cash flows for either or
