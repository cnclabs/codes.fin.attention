critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in footnote to the consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
the following sections describe the company s critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers is recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership change  which generally occurs upon shipment to customers 
revenue is net of provisions for cash discounts  returns  customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts  co op advertising and other sales related discounts 
recovery of accounts receivable the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
when aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible 
the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventory reserves the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the company conducts its annual test of impairment for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in the third quarter because it coincides with its annual strategic planning process for all of its businesses 
the company also tests for impairment if events or circumstances occur subsequent to the company s annual impairment tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the indefinite life intangible asset below its carrying amount 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
such events may include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on the company s customer base  or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers 
the company assesses the fair value of its reporting units for its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets primarily trademarks and trade names impairment tests  generally based upon a discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses  working capital  terminal value  and market discount rates 
the underlying assumptions used are consistent with those used in the strategic plan 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value  goodwill impairment may be present 
the company measures the goodwill impairment based upon the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas in  the company performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million  million net of taxes 
if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the recorded intangible asset exceeds the fair value

the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods  review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves 
as a result of the most recent analysis  the company has estimated these reserves at million 
the company s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company s product liability reserve 
while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims  the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
legal and environmental reserves the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations  as well as  contract and other disputes 
the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based largely on historical experience 
the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts  including legal fees  where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the company s cost estimates or reserve  nor do the company s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes  except with respect to long term operations and maintenance cercla matters which are estimated at present value

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company s primary market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices 
pursuant to the company s policies  natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in market prices 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions  and  for qualifying hedges  the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense 
the company s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of one year duration or less 
the company focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form offsetting or netting of like foreign currency cash flows  structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk  converting excess foreign currency deposits into us dollars or the relevant functional currency and avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency 
in addition  the company utilizes forward contracts and purchase options to hedge commercial and intercompany transactions 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions 
derivatives used to hedge intercompany loans are marked to market with the corresponding gains or losses included in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company purchases certain raw materials  including resin  steel and aluminum  which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors 
while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain  a variety of programs  including periodic raw material purchases  purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the company address this risk 
generally  the company does not use derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk 
the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value at risk estimation model 
the value at risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods 
it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variance covariance approach and include substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding equity method investments 
the fair value losses shown in the table below do not have an impact on current results of operations or financial condition  but are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest rates 
the following table indicates the calculated amounts for each of the years ended december  and in millions  except percentages december  december  confidence market risk average average level interest rates foreign exchange the confidence interval signifies the company s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above 
the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company s favor 
the value at risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse 
actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time  and it is considered highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time 
these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses  because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets
