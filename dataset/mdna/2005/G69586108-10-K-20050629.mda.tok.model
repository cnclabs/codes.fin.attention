table of contents 
index to financial statements item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a leading supplier of precision engineered packaging products for the storage  transportation and automated handling of semiconductor devices and other electronic components 
our products are designed to interface with automated handling equipment used in the production and testing of semiconductor and electronic products 
we produce principally matrix and disk drive trays  carrier tapes and reels 
we produced shipping tubes until in march at which point we exited the shipping tube business 
we also produce leadframe boxes and interleaves used in the storage and transportation of leadframes 
in addition  we collect and sell recycled matrix trays 
we primarily derive our revenue from the sale of these products 
during fiscal  we experienced an increase in demand for products servicing the semiconductor business segment 
unit volumes increased and  while prices declined generally  the rate of decline was less than the two prior years 
disk drive tray sales fell as our major customer in this segment experienced unforeseen delays in the introduction of new products 
during the year  petroleum prices increased significantly 
as we are largely dependent on raw materials that are petroleum based and because we have been unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers  our gross margin as a percent of sales degraded substantially 
we are working on ways to mitigate this increase in raw material costs during fiscal the following information is based on  and should be read with  our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
our consolidated net sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and to million in fiscal  reflecting primarily the gradual recovery of the semiconductor industry in fiscal and fiscal our consolidated net loss decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to the absence of an asset impairment charge of million which was recorded in fiscal our consolidated net loss increased to million in fiscal primarily due to increased raw material costs caused by higher petroleum prices in fiscal  an impairment charge of million associated with a write down of plant  machinery and equipment used in our tape and reel businesses  a loss of million related to the disposal and write off of fixed assets  an inventory reserve of million for recycled material that could not be economically utilized  million of inventory reserve mainly for tubes  tapes and reels due to pricing trends and million of expenses related to discrepancies in the computation and payment of taxes and social insurance contributions for workers at the factory that manufactures our products  which is located in shenzhen  the prc and operated pursuant to a processing agreement with an unaffiliated prc company 
also included in the net loss for the year was a million expense related to labor litigation in the factory in the prc 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must make a variety of estimates that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures 
the following accounting policies are currently considered most critical to the preparation of our financial statements 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is recognized when product has been shipped and title to the product has transferred to the customer 
title of the product may transfer to the end customer or distributor when shipped or when received by the customer based on a specific agreement 
we evaluate the provision for estimated returns monthly  based on historical sales and returns 
to date we have not experienced significant returns 
any increase in the level of returns could have a material and adverse effect on our financial statements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts is made against accounts receivable to the extent they are considered to be doubtful 
accounts receivable in the balance sheet are stated net of such provision 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due 
a provision is also made based on the aging of the receivables 
if circumstances change  such as the incurrence of higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change occurs regarding a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory valuation we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
at each balance sheet date  inventory on hand in excess of one year s demand or usage or those that were produced more than twelve months ago  are written down to zero 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset  significant negative industry or economic trends  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we test such assets for a potential impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the estimated future cash flows  undiscounted  are less than the asset s carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
asset to be disposed of by sale asset to be disposed of by sale represents the factory under construction in shenzhen  the prc  together with the land use right on which the building is built and is stated at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell as of the balance sheet date in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
fair value was calculated on the basis of a professional valuation report on the property provided by an independent appraiser 
as of march   fair value was calculated based on actual sales consideration received in full after year end 
deferred taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes and tax bases of assets and liabilities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is more unlikely than likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation

index to financial statements allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
any change in the future recoverability of the deferred tax assets could significantly affect the results of our operations or cash flows 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
gains or losses on disposals are reflected in current operations 
major expenditures for betterments and renewals are capitalized 
all ordinary repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives 
the useful lives of property  plant and equipment adopted for depreciation purposes are as follows buildings years plant  machinery and equipment years molds years leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and motor vehicles years results of operations cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold primarily consists of costs of raw materials  labor  and manufacturing overheads 
operating expenses 
selling and marketing expenses primarily consists of freight and delivery costs  salaries and allowances 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and allowances and legal  professional and consulting fees 
research and development expenses primarily consist of raw material costs and fixed assets depreciation

revenues increased by million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from greater demand across all products  except for disk drive trays

index to financial statements revenue from sales of our ic trays increased by 
volume for ic trays increased by while average selling price dropped by 
the increase in volume for ic trays was primarily due to increased demand for such trays 
revenue from sales of our disk drive trays decreased by driven mainly by a drop in average selling price by while volume increased by 
revenue from sales of our carrier tape products increased by compared to last year primarily due to a volume increase of while average selling price dropped by compared to the prior year 
revenue from sales of our reel products increased by compared to last year primarily due to a volume increase of while average selling price dropped by compared to the prior year 
revenue from sales of our cover tape products increased by reflecting both a increase in volume and a increase in an average selling price 
revenue from sales of our tube products increased by reflecting both increase in volume and increase in an average selling price 
our disk drive tray sales have generally been to one major customer or to subcontractors supporting that customer 
these sales are largely dependent on the introduction of new products by that customer 
new product introductions are difficult to forecast both with respect to timing as well as demand 
we have been producing new custom molds for that customer in anticipation of several new products  but this activity has not yet led to significant production orders 
mature products  while requiring some replacement trays  do not generally generate a sustainable high level of revenue 
as a result  revenue from sales of our disk drive trays has  and will in the future  fluctuate dramatically with the corresponding fluctuations in the introduction of new products 
during the quarter ended december   we announced to our customers our intention to discontinue the production and sale of tubes and in march we exited the tube business 
we gave our customers until the end of march to place orders for last time buys 
we accelerated depreciation on the dedicated equipment used in the manufacturing of tubes and as a result all such assets had a zero book value at the time of disposal 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal  a decrease 
gross margin deteriorated to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting a reduction in the average selling price of our products and an increase in the cost of raw material due to higher petroleum prices 
the gross profit for fiscal also included an impairment charge of million associated with a write down of plant  machinery and equipment used in our tape and reel businesses  a million loss related to the disposal and write off of fixed assets  an inventory reserve of million for recycled material that could not be economically utilized  million of inventory reserve mainly for tubes  tapes and reels due to pricing trends and million of expenses related to discrepancies in the computation and payment of taxes and social insurance contributions for workers at peak s main production facilities the factory  which are located in shenzhen  the prc and operated pursuant to a processing agreement with an unaffiliated prc company 
the discrepancy  which was at the factory and not at peak  was discovered as a result of a claim by an employee regarding the computation of wages and withholding 
upon discovery of these discrepancies  we conducted an internal review of the factory s practices and engaged third party advisors to assist us in assessing the factory s and our obligations with respect to these discrepancies 
upon completion of this review in the third quarter of fiscal  management concluded that the factory had a duty to correct certain of these discrepancies that amounted to a total of million 
while we believe we are not contractually obligated under the terms of our agreement with our processing partner to pay these amounts and while no claim has been made by any government agency  we voluntarily made payments of approximately million to the prc tax authorities in the fourth quarter of fiscal in order to avoid the seizure of the factory s assets and keep it operational 
also included in the gross profit for the year was a million expense related to labor litigation in the factory in the prc

volume for ic trays increased by while average selling price dropped by which decrease was not as dramatic as the drop from fiscal to revenue from sales of our disk drive trays decreased by driven mainly by a drop in volume by while average selling price increased 
the decrease in volume for disk drive trays was primarily due to decreased demand for such trays 
revenue from sales of our carrier tape products increased by compared to last year primarily due to a volume increase of compared to the prior year 
revenue from sales of our tube products increased by reflecting a increase in volume offset by an average selling price decline of as a result of a change in product sales mix 
the reduction in the average selling price of our products was mainly due to product and customer mix changes 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  an increase of 
gross margin improved to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting more efficient utilization of factory capacity as volumes increased  the benefit of which was partly offset by an aggregate reductions of in the average selling price of some of our products and an increase of in the cost of raw materials 
loss from operations 
an operating loss of million was recorded for fiscal compared to a loss of million recorded for fiscal  which included an asset impairment charge of million 
asset impairment 
an asset impairment charge of million was recorded in fiscal due to the decline in the fair value of the unoccupied factory building in shenzhen  the prc  as it was reclassified to an asset to be disposed of by sale 
no such charge was recorded in fiscal a valuation of the building by an independent appraiser on april  showed the value of this asset in fiscal to be the same as that of fiscal we have been actively marketing the building since we decided to sell it 
the sale of this building was eventually completed on april  selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased by or million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase is primarily due to increases in freight  storage  traveling and staffing costs associated with the increased shipment of our products  as well as increased office rental

liquidity and capital resources we historically met a significant portion of our cash requirements from cash flow from operations and we expect this to continue in fiscal in fiscal  we generated million from the sale of shares of our common stock 
our primary uses of cash have been to fund capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities and operations and working capital requirements 
we intend to continue to retain our earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business operations and do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 
as of march   cash and cash equivalents were million  an increase of million as compared to cash and cash equivalents of million as of march  our net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to a net cash provision of million in fiscal and a net cash usage of million in fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to better control of collections and the management of payouts for purchases and the deposit received regarding the sale of our subsidiary that held the assets to be disposed of by sale 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily caused by an operating loss incurred during fiscal year our net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of capital expenditures of million  million and million for the acquisition of new equipment in our current facility during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the continuous investment in capital expenditure during fiscal and reflected capacity expansion due to the increase in economic activity in the semiconductor industry and replacement of obsolete fixed assets 
as of march   we had commitments for capital expenditures of million 
the actual amounts of capital expenditures may vary substantially from those budgeted or estimated for a variety of reasons  including changes in market conditions  unavailability or changes in scheduled delivery of specific equipment  changes in interest rates and other factors 
in addition  we plan to continue to expand capacity and replace our obsolete fixed assets in future periods and plan to fund such expansion through our current cash reserves  future cash flow from operations and new bank borrowings as required 
we lease office and warehouse facilities under various leases that expire through total future minimum commitments under these leases amount to approximately million 
as of march   we had no outstanding indebtedness 
at march   the company had unsecured letter of credit facilities available of million of which million remained unused 
interest rates in respect of credit facilities are generally based on the weighted average lending rates of and the line of credit is normally subject to annual review 
according to customs rules in the prc  it is possible that we may be subject to classification by the chinese customs authorities in a manner that would require us to supply a substantial bond against customs duties that we

if the customs authorities of the prc require us to post a bond in connection with our exemption status from prc duties on imported raw materials for export sales  and exported products  we will experience a substantial drain of our cash resources 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to a cash usage of million in fiscal and a net cash provision of million in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was due to proceeds from issuance of common stock 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was primarily used to repurchase shares of our common stock 
in september  our board of directors authorized the repurchase  at management s discretion  of up to million worth of our common stock at prices not to exceed of our net asset value per share 
common stock repurchased was cancelled immediately 
during the years ended march  and  we repurchased  and  shares of common stock  respectively  at an average cost of and respectively per share 
there was no repurchase of shares for year ended march  as of march   our principal source of liquidity consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months 
if our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional public or private equity securities or obtain debt financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all  or if available  will be obtained on terms favorable to us 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
the company does not use off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  nor does it use other forms of off balance sheet arrangements such as research and development arrangements 
accordingly  the company s liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
from time to time  we may evaluate possible investments or acquisitions and may  if a suitable opportunity arises  make such an investment or acquisition

hong kong profits tax the factory at which our products are produced  which is located in shenzhen  the prc  is operated pursuant to a processing agreement with an unaffiliated prc company 
according to the tax guidelines issued by the tax authority in a situation where a hong kong company manufactures goods partly in hong kong and partly 
table of contents 
index to financial statements outside hong kong  the hong kong inland revenue department ird may accept profits that relate to the manufacture of the goods outside hong kong to be offshore in nature and therefore not subject to hong kong profits tax 
the offshore claim would only be allowed by the ird by way of concession and provided that certain criteria are met to their satisfaction 
we believed that most of its manufacturing activities were conducted outside hong kong and therefore since fiscal it apportioned a substantial amount of its profits to to activities outside hong kong for tax filing purposes 
however  since fiscal  there was a dispute with the ird in relation to the apportionment basis of the profit derived from manufacturing activities outside hong kong 
we raised a number of objections to the tax assessments and examined factors that the ird used to ascertain the geographic nature of our activities and sources of the profits 
we made provisions for taxes payable according to the apportionment basis based on practices normally acceptable by the ird in general cases 
interest associated with the tax payable for fiscal years to had also been accrued 
we believed that the aggregate maximum amount of its potential exposure was approximately million plus interest in the amount of million 
as a result  the company accrued million as of march  and million as of march  as part of the income taxes payable 
in connection with the above  the ird requested that we place tax reserve certificates of million with ird as of march  and million and letters of credit of million with the ird as of march   which could be recovered if we prevailed 
in the year ended march   we reached a settlement with the ird and these tax reserve certificates were utilized to pay for the prior year taxes

new accounting standards in december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  or statement r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
or opinion generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in the unrevised statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
in april  the sec deferred the effective date of statement r so that companies may now adopt its provisions at the beginning of their first annual period beginning after june  which would be fiscal  beginning april  for us 
as permitted by the unrevised statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method  under which we generally do not record compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend  in part  on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements

factors that may affect operating results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
if an adverse outcome of any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in evaluating our business  shareholders should consider carefully the following factors in addition to the other information presented herein 
our operating results are difficult to predict and are likely to fluctuate significantly based on several factors  which can cause our stock price to decline 
our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially affect net sales and profitability or lead to significant fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results 
these factors include  among others the price of raw materials  the majority of which are petroleum derivatives 
prices of these raw materials are significantly affected by oil prices which recently have become volatile  factors relating to conditions in the semiconductor  disk drive and electronic industries including lower demand for products  increased price competition  downturns and deterioration of business conditions  technological changes  and changes in production processes in the semiconductor and electronic industries which could require changes in packaging products  although we do not believe that it is our liability  the need for us to pay and the amounts that we might pay on a voluntary basis for certain tax  social insurance contributions and potential penalties on behalf of the factory at which our products are manufactured in order to avoid the seizure of the factory s assets and keep it operational  as well as claims resulting from employee lawsuits against the factory  capital requirements and the availability of funding  our expansion plan and possible disruptions caused by the installation of new equipment or the construction of new facilities  the lack of long term purchase or supply agreements with customers  the loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled employees  international political or economic events or developments  including those relating to hong kong and the prc  our relationship with our processing partner in the prc and the ability of the government of the prc to seize the assets and shut down our factory operated in the prc  production volume fluctuations and the management of our inventories  currency fluctuations and foreign exchange rules and regulations in the prc  the recurrence of sars or other major health issues in asia  the outcome of patent litigation in taiwan  and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the imposition of fines  penalties and bonds arising from violations of rules and regulations in the prc relating to customs regulations  foreign currency exchange rules  taxation  the withholding of taxes for employees and other laws and regulation 
unfavorable changes in the above or other factors could substantially harm our results of operations or financial condition 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations will not necessarily be meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as an indication of our future performance 
if our results of operations in one or more periods fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the trading price of our common stock may decline  possibly by a significant amount 
we depend on the health of the semiconductor  disk drive and electronics industries which are highly cyclical and the decline in demand for products in these industries could severely affect our net sales and financial results 
our net sales depend on increased demand for our products from manufacturers of semiconductor  disk drive and electronic components 
any deterioration of business conditions in the semiconductor industry  including lower demand for semiconductor products  decreased unit volume of semiconductor products shipped  other factors resulting in decreased demand for packaging products  or increased price competition in the semiconductor industry could result in increased price pressure on suppliers to the semiconductor industry  and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the industries we serve are characterized by rapid technological change leading to more complex products  evolving industry standards  intense competition and fluctuations in demand 
from time to time  demand for electronic systems  which generally include both semiconductors and electronic components  has suffered significant downturns  which in some cases have been prolonged 
for example  during and  demand for our products decreased as the overall economy and the electronics industry experienced a general downturn in business 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  product over capacity and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
any future downturn in the semiconductor or disk drive or electronics industries may substantially harm our results of operations or financial condition 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our key customers would harm our business 
our top customers together accounted for  and of our net sales in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we are dependent upon a single customer  seagate technology  for substantially all sales of our disk drive trays  with whom we have no long term contract 
in addition  in fiscal  ase accounted for of our net sales 
like seagate technology  we do not have a long term contract with ase 
our ability to maintain close  mutually beneficial relationships with our leading customers is important to the ongoing growth and profitability of our business 
although our sales to specific customers have varied from year to year  our results of operations have been dependent on a number of significant customers and the conditions of their respective industries 
all of our customers operate in the global semiconductor  disk drive and electronic industries which historically have been highly cyclical 
as a result of the concentration of our customer base  the loss or cancellation of business from  or significant changes in scheduled deliveries or decreases in the prices of products or services provided to  any of these customers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our sales are made pursuant to purchase orders  and therefore  we generally have no agreements with or commitments from our customers for the purchase of products 
although customers typically provide us with forecasts of their requirements  these forecasts are not binding 
our customers may not maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for our products and we may be unable to maintain or add to our existing customer base 
our operations are concentrated in the people s republic of china and we are subject to the risks associated with international operations  which may negatively affect our business 
as of march   substantially all of our fixed assets and inventories were located in shenzhen  the prc 
our main production facilities are located in shenzhen  the prc and are operated pursuant to a processing 
table of contents 
index to financial statements agreement with an unaffiliated prc company that obligates it to provide all of the personnel for the operation of our facilities and to render assistance in dealing with matters relating to the import of raw materials and the export of our products 
we are dependent on continued good relations with our processing partner in order to supervise the operation of the factory and its employees 
our existing production facilities in shenzhen  the prc are located on land leased from the prc government by one of our wholly owned subsidiaries under land use certificates and agreements with a remaining term of approximately years 
our assets and facilities located in the prc and the prc company s operation of these facilities are subject to the laws and regulations of the prc and our results of operations in the prc are subject to the economic and political situation in the prc 
in january  we entered into negotiations with our processing partner to revise and update our agreement regarding the operation of the factory 
while these negotiations have been suspended  we expect to be able to renegotiate some of the terms and conditions of the processing agreement 
there are no assurances that we will be able to do so  which could lead to increased costs and harm our business 
in addition  during the third fiscal quarter of  we discovered discrepancies  which were at the our main production facilities in shenzhen and not at peak  in the computation and withholding of both taxes and social insurance contributions for workers at the factory 
upon discovery of these discrepancies  we conducted an internal review of the factory s practices and we concluded that the factory had a duty to correct certain of these discrepancies 
while we believe we were not contractually obligated under the terms of our agreement with our processing partner to pay these amounts  we elected to voluntarily make such payment in order to avoid the seizure of the factory s assets and keep it operational 
in april  the prc tax authorities began an investigation into the withholding and payment of income taxes by the factory in shenzhen for certain current and former employees of peak  its affiliates or other companies who performed services at the factory but may not have paid income taxes in the prc and for whom the factory may not have withheld and paid income taxes 
we are assisting the prc authorities and  while no claim has been made at this time  the prc tax authorities may seek to collect unpaid incomes taxes on salaries and expense allowances of certain current and former employees of peak  affiliates of peak or other companies who performed services in the prc based on such worker s relationship with the factory  and interest and penalties on such amounts 
since some of these claims are based on income earned over several years  the amount of such taxes  accrued interest and penalties could be substantial 
we do not believe that we are liable for such claims  but in the event the prc tax authorities determine payments for back taxes  interest and penalties are owed  the potential consequences include substantial monetary claims against the factory or the seizure of the factory and our assets at the factory and the termination of substantially all of our production operations 
in the event the prc authorities asserted claims for such taxes against the factory  we may make such payments on a voluntary basis in order to avoid the seizure of the factory or our assets at the factory and keep it operational 
voluntary payments by us on behalf of the factory to the prc tax authorities could diminish a significant portion of our current cash reserves and materially harm our operating results and business 
in addition  the factory may in the future be subject to further investigations by the prc tax authorities for claims of unpaid taxes  which we may be required to pay in order to avoid seizure of the shenzhen factory 
the operations of our production facilities in shenzhen  the prc may be harmed by changes in the laws and regulations of the prc or the interpretation thereof  such as those relating to taxation  import and export tariffs  environmental regulations  land use rights  property  foreign currency exchange regulations and other matters 
prior to september  we exported all the products manufactured at our production facilities in shenzhen  the prc 
accordingly  we were not subject to certain prc taxes and are exempt from customs duties on imported raw materials and exported products 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we finished the procedure of setting up a wholly owned subsidiary in the prc and hence a small portion of our products was sold locally in the prc 
this newly established prc subsidiary is subject to prc taxes and customs duties on materials imported for such prc sales 
according to customs rules in the prc  we may be subject to classification by the chinese customs authorities in a manner that would require us to supply a substantial bond against customs duties that we would have to pay if we were importing material for ultimate sale in the prc 
we may also be subject to significantly higher administrative importation costs generally 
these measures could harm our ability to manufacture products at a competitive price and our results of operations could suffer 
in addition  if we are required to post a

index to financial statements bond in connection with our exemption status from prc duties on imported raw materials for export sales and exported products  we will experience a substantial drain of our liquid resources 
we may not be able to provide the required bond at a commercially feasible cost  or at all 
we may become subject to prc taxes and may be required to pay customs duties in the future even under the contract processing agreement 
if we are required to pay prc taxes or customs duties  our results of operations could suffer 
we believe that our operations in shenzhen  the prc are now in compliance with the applicable prc legal and regulatory requirements for custom duties 
however  the central or local governments of the prc may impose new regulations or interpretations of existing laws  rules and regulations which could require additional expenditures or preclude the production of products in the prc by peak or our processing partner 
the economy of the prc differs from the economies of many countries in many respects such as structure  government involvement  level of development  growth rate  capital reinvestment  allocation of resources  self sufficiency  rate of inflation and balance of payments position  among others 
in the past  the economy of the prc has been primarily a planned economy subject to state plans 
since the entry of the prc into the world trade organization in  the prc government has been reforming its economic and political systems 
these reforms have resulted in significant economic growth and social change 
we cannot assure  however  that the prc government s policies for economic reforms will be consistent or effective 
our results of operations and financial position may be harmed by changes in the prc s political  economic or social conditions 
we have in the past and may in the future  be party to legal proceedings that could have a negative financial impact on us 
we have in the past been involved in litigation relating to securities and employment law  and are currently involved in litigation in taiwan related to intellectual property  tax and labor disputes in the prc 
while these lawsuits and disputes vary greatly in the materiality of potential liability associated with them  the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved litigation could seriously harm our business  financial condition and reputation  whether material individually or in the aggregate 
in particular  this uncertainty could harm our relationships with existing customers  our ability to obtain new customers and our ability to operate our business 
litigation and the resolution of disputes also could result in the diversion of our management s time and attention away from business operations  which could harm our business 
negative developments with respect to the litigation could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly 
in addition  we are unable to determine the amount  if any  that we may be required to pay if litigation is not resolved in a favorable manner 
for more information about the litigation  please see item entitled legal proceedings 
a significant portion of our business is conducted in the asia pacific region 
this concentration could expose us to risks inherent to doing business in the asia pacific region that could harm our business 
a significant portion of our net sales are derived from sales to customers in hong kong  singapore  taiwan  the philippines and other countries in east and southeast asia  or the asia pacific region 
accordingly  our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of shares of our common stock may be affected by economic and political instability  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  customs  duties and other trade barriers  transportation delays  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  currency convertibility and repatriation  taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel  the recurrence of sars and other major health issues

none of these factors are within our control 
in fiscal  many countries in the asia pacific region experienced considerable currency volatility and depreciation  high interest rates  stock market volatility and declining asset values which contributed to net foreign capital outflows  an increase in the number of insolvencies  a decline in business and consumer spending and a decrease in economic growth as compared with prior years 
consumer demand for products that use semiconductors  disk drives and electronic components generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and falls as such activity decreases 
in addition  currency devaluations in the asia pacific region could result in accelerated price erosion of semiconductor and electronic products as products manufactured in countries whose currencies have devalued significantly against the us dollar become less expensive in us dollar terms 
any adverse effect on the global semiconductor  disk drive and electronic industries as a result of lower demand for products in the asia pacific region or accelerated product price erosion arising from currency devaluations in the asia pacific region could harm our financial condition or results of operations 
we are incorporated under the laws of bermuda and there may be potential difficulties in protecting our shareholders rights 
we are incorporated under the laws of bermuda and our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum of association and bye laws and by the laws governing corporations incorporated in bermuda 
the rights of our shareholders and the responsibilities of members of our board of directors under bermuda law are different from those applicable to a corporation incorporated in the united states and  therefore  our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests in connection with actions by our management  members of our board of directors or our principal shareholder than they would as shareholders of a corporation incorporated in the united states 
our stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile 
a decline in our stock price could result in securities class action litigation against us  which could divert management s attention and harm our business 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
our stock price could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  including variations in our actual or anticipated operating results  sales of substantial amounts of our stock  announcements about us or about our competitors  including technological innovation or new products or services  litigation and other developments relating to patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors  conditions in the semiconductor  disk drive and electronics industries  governmental regulation and legislation  international political or economic events or developments  including those relating to hong kong and the prc

many of these factors are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock markets in general  and the nasdaq national market in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations recently 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market prices of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of other securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as a result  current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our operating results could be harmed 
we have in the past discovered  and may in the future discover  areas of our internal controls that need improvement and we have devoted  and will in the future devote  resources to remediate and improve our internal controls 
although we believe that these efforts have strengthened our internal controls  we are continuing to work to improve our internal controls 
we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock 
changes to financial accounting standards may affect our results of operations and cause us to change our business practices 
we prepare our financial statements to conform with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  in the united states 
these accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants  the securities and exchange commission and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
changes to those rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
for example  accounting policies affecting many aspects of our business  including rules relating to employee stock option grants  have recently been revised or are under review 
the financial accounting standards board and other agencies have finalized changes to us generally accepted accounting principles that will require us  starting in our fiscal year  to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives 
we may have significant and ongoing accounting charges resulting from option grant and other equity incentive expensing that could reduce our overall net income 
in addition  since we historically have used equity related compensation as a component of our total employee compensation program  the accounting change could make the use of equity related compensation less attractive to us and therefore make it more difficult to attract and retain employees

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency exchange rate fluctuations our sales are denominated primarily in us dollars while our cost of goods sold are generally incurred in us dollars  hong kong dollars and renminbi  and our operating expenses are generally denominated in renminbi  hong kong dollars  singapore dollars  new taiwanese dollars and us dollars 
in addition  a substantial portion of our capital expenditures  primarily for the purchase of equipment  has been and is expected to continue to be denominated in us dollars  renminbi  japanese yen and the euro 
consequently  a portion of our costs and operating margins may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates  primarily between the us dollar and other currencies 
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of new or additional currency controls in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
at march  and  we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
many of our competitors are located in countries whose currencies devalued significantly against the us dollar beginning in the second half of as a result of such devaluation  these competitors products have become less expensive in us dollar terms 
this reduction could result in our customers purchasing products from these competitors rather than from us  which would have a material and adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations 
as the hong kong dollar is officially pegged to the us dollar and the renminbi is controlled by the prc government such that it only trades within a limited range against the us dollar  unless there are significant changes in the policies of the hong kong and the prc government  fluctuations in the exchange rates of the hong kong dollar and the renminbi are not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations
