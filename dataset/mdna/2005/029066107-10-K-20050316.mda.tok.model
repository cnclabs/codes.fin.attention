item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a with a discussion of our business outlook for we also provide a discussion of our results of operations for compared to  and for compared to this discussion includes an overview of our operating results and the directions in which our markets  segments  and geographies are moving 
we then provide a liquidity and financial resources discussion of the significant changes in our balance sheet during  and cash flows for compared to  and for compared to  as well as our contractual obligations and foreign currency activity 
this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies that we believe are important to our business operations and understanding of our results of operations 
we conclude with information about factors that may affect our future results 
this md a should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form k  including item business  item selected financial data  item financial statements and supplementary data  and item a controls and procedures 
in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k 
business outlook while there continues to be uncertainty around interest rate levels  energy costs and  in general  macroeconomic conditions and their potential impact on corporate investment and consumer spending  we enter with a cautious but optimistic outlook for our business 
we are also pleased with the progress we made and momentum we created during our fiscal year 
we had strong performance across all segments of the business and we are particularly proud of the progress we have made in the data center space  as sales of infrastruxure nearly doubled in from the commitment we have made to educate the market and drive adoption of the technology we believe is paying off as customers are embracing the modular  standardized approach apc has pioneered in network critical physical infrastructure  or ncpi  and they are excited about it 
the statements below do not include any impact related to the expensing of stock options according to statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  which will be effective for apc for the third and fourth fiscal quarters of the pro forma earnings impact of expensing of stock options on our results of operations for is described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
against this background  we are planning for continued growth in annual revenue and increasing gross profit and operating profit dollars in we believe that we are very well positioned competitively  financially and strategically going into we will continue to be focused on empowering it professionals with the knowledge  tools and solutions they need to effectively design  build and manage network critical physical infrastructure 
our objective is for apc to become a trusted  global partner for the long term  committed to solving our customers network critical physical infrastructure problems of today  and helping them anticipate their challenges of tomorrow  thereby allowing them to focus on their core competencies 
we believe that we can accomplish this by dramatically reducing our customers level of complexity involved in designing  building  and managing the network critical physical infrastructure that is at the very core of maintaining business continuity  application availability  and network reliability 
as we look ahead to  we are currently planning for growth in annual revenue in all three of our reportable segments small systems  large systems and other 
similar to  we expect the rate of growth of our large systems segment to be greater than the growth expected for small systems due to the assumed continued success of our overall strategy and the acceptance of our products in specific market segments 
overall gross margins for are currently expected to be impacted by a shift in product mix toward the faster growing  lower margin large systems products 
gross margins  particularly for small systems products  are expected to be impacted by planned price reductions which we anticipate will be partially offset by the favorable impact of the expected reduction of the unit costs of our products  particularly material costs  as a result of assumed unit volume growth and our continued efforts to improve manufacturing cost efficiencies 
we also expect  albeit to a lesser degree than in  favorable pricing arrangements with our suppliers 
gross margin variability could result from changing revenue levels  which are dependent on unit volumes  prices and currency trends as well as the mix of products sold  unit costs and yield issues associated with production at our factories  excess manufacturing capacity  excess inventory  inventory obsolescence and variations in inventory valuation 
we have dedicated significant efforts to optimize our overall manufacturing capacity and locations over recent years and we will continue to plan for future capacity requirements based on the assumed continued acceptance and demand for our products in the specific market segments they were designed to address 
we currently expect that capital spending will be between million and million in  compared to million in we expect that most of the capital spending for will go toward the maintaining  upgrading and expansion of current manufacturing capacity  as well as investments to upgrade current hardware and software office technologies 
we spent nearly more on research and development in vs 
 investing million in advancing our ncpi systems in addition to ensuring our end to end offering is the best in the industry 
we are committed to sustaining our r d efforts to meet the future needs of our customers across all segments and potentially expanding into emerging  high growth areas 
we will remain focused on aggressively driving our growth of our network critical physical infrastructure solutions  which will require sustaining and increasing our operating expense investments in sales and marketing  as well as making incremental investments in global customer education initiatives 
in alone we trained nearly one hundred thousand customers and partners on infrastruxure  significantly more than we trained in and our goals for are even higher 
our investment posture remains intact and we are firmly committed to supporting the level of sales and marketing spending necessary to educate customers and channel partners on the inherent performance and total cost of ownership benefits of a modular  standardized solution such as infrastruxure 
we currently expect our tax rate to be approximately for  excluding the potential tax impact of the repatriation of offshore earnings discussed below 
the estimated effective tax rate is based on current tax law and the current expected income 
the tax rate may be affected by the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed  our ability to successfully implement additional tax savings planning opportunities and our ability to realize deferred tax assets 
in october  the american jobs creation act of was enacted 
this act repealed the tax code s extraterritorial income eti exclusion in response to the world trade organization s challenge that the eti exclusion was a prohibited tax subsidy 
the repeal will be phased in through the act replaced the eti exclusion with a domestic deduction for domestic production activities effective for apc s tax year 
the act also provides for an elective tax favored repatriation of offshore earnings  provided that the dividends are invested in the united states under a properly approved domestic reinvestment plan 
the election to apply an dividends received deduction against cash dividends made by apc s offshore subsidiaries can be made in either or we are currently reviewing the act to determine its impact on apc 
apc expects to determine the amounts and sources of foreign earnings to be repatriated  if any  during the third quarter of fiscal we are currently a party to various legal proceedings and claims 
the expected costs to litigate such matters were significant in and we expect such costs in to be less than the levels incurred during the prior year  as a result of the our entering into a binding memorandum of understanding to settle two patent infringement suits 
we currently do not believe that the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations 
however  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  including the risk of an unfavorable outcome  and management s view of these matters may change in the future 
an unfavorable outcome could include monetary damages or  in cases where injunctive relief is sought  an injunction prohibiting certain activities 
if an unfavorable outcome were to occur in any specific period  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that period or future periods 
we believe that  given our current liquidity and cash and investment balances  even an adverse judgment would not have a material impact on cash and investments or liquidity 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december   and the following table sets forth key data  expressed as a percentage of net sales  for the years ended december   and net sales cost of goods sold gross profit marketing  selling  general administrative expenses research development operating income other income  net earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change net income revenues net sales in fiscal year of billion increased by over  net sales in fiscal year of billion increased by over these increases were attributable to strength in our major product segments  the small and large system segments  as well as growth across our major geographies 
demand for information technology hardware continued to be healthy in our product segment growth reflected ongoing advancement of our data center initiatives 
management believes that our investments in technology and demand generation continue to drive the adoption of apc s network critical physical infrastructure solution  infrastruxure 
our core uninterruptible power supply ups offerings also contributed solid growth during each of and for further information about revenues by segment  refer to the segment results section below 
sales of new products contributed to overall net sales in  and sales of products introduced during  and represented approximately   and  respectively  of net sales in those years 
revenues by geography 
the following table summarizes our revenues on a geographic basis for the years ended december   and of total of total of total in millions us canada and latin america total americas europe  the middle east  and africa emea asia total net sales    total net sales outside us the americas north and latin america increased in over  and also increased in over emea increased in over  and also increased in over finally  asia increased in over  and also increased in over in fiscal year  on a constant currency basis  emea increased and asia increased from in fiscal year  on a constant currency basis  emea increased and asia increased over in  and  on a constant currency basis  emea s revenues would have been lower by million  million  and million respectively  principally due to strengthening of the euro and british pound 
in and  on a constant currency basis  asia s revenues would have been lower by million and million  respectively  principally due to strengthening of the japanese yen and australian dollar 
in  asia s revenues would have been higher by million  principally due to weakening of the japanese yen 
in total  the impact of currency exchange rate changes worldwide added million  million  and million to net sales in fiscal year  and  respectively 
we believe constant currency information is useful for an understanding of our operating results 
revenues on a constant currency basis differ from revenues presented in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was billion or of net sales in fiscal year compared to million or of net sales in fiscal year and million or of net sales in fiscal year gross margins for fiscal year were of net sales  approximately basis points lower than in fiscal year gross margins for fiscal year were of net sales  approximately basis points higher than in fiscal year gross margins in and were negatively impacted by pricing actions and  to a lesser extent  product mix shifts  notably within our small systems segment toward lower margin products combined with strong sales growth in our lower margin large systems segment 
the downward pressure of these factors was substantially offset by cost reductions  particularly in the small systems segment  from declining material costs and select product transitions to low cost manufacturing locations  but not to the extent of prior periods  as well as the favorable pricing impact of a weakening us dollar  particularly in europe 
for further information about gross margins by segment  refer to the segment results section below 
provision for excess inventory 
additionally  third quarter gross margins included the effects of a million incremental charge for excess inventory related to specifically identified finished goods and raw materials inventories deemed obsolete as the result of recently commenced efforts to reduce the number of unique product offerings in several of our product lines  as well as the result of new product introductions 
there were no additional inventory charges  other than apc s standard provisioning  during the fourth quarter of or during fiscal years and product recall 
gross margins in and included the effects of a fourth quarter provision for and third quarter update of estimated costs associated with the product recall of back ups cs and models 
in early  apc announced a product recall of back ups cs and models  due to potential safety issues 
prior to announcing the recall  apc received eight reports worldwide of units overheating  resulting in the melting of the unit s outer casing  six of which occurred in the united states 
three of the reported incidents resulted in minor property damage  no injuries have been reported 
the total number of affected devices recalled worldwide is approximately million with approximately  devices recalled in the united states 
the recall is limited to two specific models in apc s back ups cs product line  the back ups cs and the back ups cs  in both volt and volt models 
the affected units were manufactured between november and december and were sold primarily through computer and electrical distribution  catalog and retail outlets worldwide 
in the fourth quarter of  apc accrued a current liability and recognized additional warranty expense  classified in cost of goods sold  of million 
based upon repair cost and return rate experience to date as well as then current estimates of remaining costs to be incurred  apc projected that aggregate costs for the recall would be less than originally estimated 
to reflect this change  cost of goods sold was reduced by million in the third quarter of the original charge and subsequent credit to warranty expense have not been allocated to our operating segments  but rather have been classified in indirect operating expenses for segment reporting consistent with our classification for our internal financial reporting  also refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
as of december   apc had incurred approximately of currently estimated total recall costs 
our estimation of remaining recall costs of million  comprised of million for the us and million for international geographies  continues to be subject to actual return rates and per unit repair costs which can vary by country as well as estimates for other recall related costs expected to be incurred 
we expect that future amounts will not differ materially from our current estimates 
also refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
intellectual property settlement 
fiscal year gross margins also included the effects of a fourth quarter charge associated with the settlement of a claim for the infringement of intellectual property of million 
this charge has not been allocated to our operating segments  but rather has been classified as an indirect operating expense for segment reporting consistent with our classification for our internal financial reporting  also refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
this charge was the result of events or assessments that occurred during the fourth quarter of restructuring and impairment of assets 
fiscal year gross margins also included the effects of a fourth quarter charge for impairment of assets held for sale of approximately million  and first quarter charges for restructuring costs of approximately million associated with our first quarter global headcount reductions 
these actions impacted personnel worldwide  principally in the us  us  ireland  and the philippines  throughout a broad range of functions within the organization 
the majority of these terminations were the result of our decision to consolidate our philippines based manufacturing operations 
these restructuring costs were the result of events or assessments that occurred during the first quarter of and included the effects of approximately employee terminations  principally in manufacturing  in sales and in r d  based on severance agreements  as well as facilities closures  and the related impairment of tangible assets  principally buildings and manufacturing equipment  based on management s assessment of market data 
these charges have not been allocated to our operating segments  but rather have been classified as indirect operating expenses for segment reporting consistent with our classification for our internal financial reporting  also refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
these charges were the result of events or assessments that occurred during the respective quarters of our restructuring actions were announced and substantially completed during apc s executive management approved these actions for immediate implementation  substantially all related restructuring costs were incurred in the first quarter of  the period in which the restructuring actions were first approved and implemented 
in connection with apc s decision to consolidate its philippines based manufacturing operations  apc closed manufacturing facilities located in the philippines province of laguna  in maryland  and also in the uk apc marketed its philippines property with an intent to sell these assets in however  apc was unable to complete this sale as a result of an unfavorable real estate market 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in the second quarter of the philippines building and equipment were reclassified at their fair values  which aggregated million  to held for use property  plant  and equipment and depreciation re commenced 
apc sold a building in maryland to a third party in october also  in connection with the closure of a leased facility in the uk  apc recognized a lease liability during the first quarter of  this lease will expire in due to the timing of the facilities closures and contractual or regulatory obligations to certain workers  the financial benefits of these actions did not commence until the second quarter of with most of the full benefit being realized by the close of ongoing operating expenses of the closed facilities were approximately million annually  substantially all of which we expect will result in future annual savings 
also refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
inventory reserves 
total inventory reserves at december  were million compared to million at december  this increase was due primarily to the aforementioned charge for excess inventory as well as routine provisioning that was necessary as a result of applying apc s inventory reserve methodology throughout the year  partially offset by the physical disposition of inventories covered by apc s inventory reserves 
apc s reserve estimate methodology involves quantifying the total inventory position having potential loss exposure 
loss exposure generally results from several business factors  including product or component discontinuance  unplanned changes in demand  product design changes  and factory transitions 
quantifying such loss exposure is the result of combining the cost of inventories specifically identified as having little or no opportunity for sale or use thus available for physical disposition plus the cost of inventories having a high risk of no future sale or use based upon an analysis of on hand quantities compared to historical and anticipated future sale or use 
apc maintains an on going business process for the physical disposition of inventories previously identified 
inventory write offs occur at the time of physical disposition 
inventories  once reserved  are not written back up as such reserve adjustments are considered to be a permanent decrease to the cost basis of the excess or obsolete inventory 
segment results also refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for important information regarding apc s reportable segments in thousands segment net sales small systems    large systems    other    total segment net sales    shipping and handling revenues    total net sales    segment profits small systems    large systems    other    total segment profits    shipping and handling net costs    provision for excess inventory  provision for intellectual property infringement claim  product recall provision update   restructuring charges  impairment of assets held for sale  other indirect operating expenses    other income  net    earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change small systems 
net sales for products in the small systems segment  which provides power protection  ups and management products for the pc  server and networking markets  increased in fiscal year by over  and also increased in fiscal year by over strength in ncpi and infrastruxure related products drove solid performance in this segment  which also benefited from strong sales of apc s core upss  the back ups and smart ups lines 
the improvement over the prior year also reflected increased demand for back ups and smart ups worldwide  combined with increased sales of rack enclosures and management solutions 
gross margins for the small systems segment improved in each of and over the respective prior year levels 
the factors favorably influencing the gross margins of this segment included product cost reductions and favorable currency trends 
our small systems cost reductions were achieved through a combination of product transitions to low cost manufacturing locations and material cost reductions from our supplier base 
our product cost reductions were driven principally by material cost improvements and favorably impacted gross margins in the small systems segment by approximately basis points and basis points in the fiscal years and  respectively 
partially offsetting the favorable product cost and currency trends were the impact of pricing actions and product mix shifts within the segment 
large systems 
net sales for products in the large systems segment  consisting primarily of phase ups  services  precision cooling and ancillary products for data centers  facilities and communication applications  increased in fiscal year over  and also increased in fiscal year over with approximately of infrastruxure revenue included in the large systems segment  infrastruxure sales were a major contributor to the year over year growth of this segment 
on a product level  symmetra phase  the primary power component of an infrastruxure system  our industrial products  and services were leading growth drivers 
the improvement in over the prior year also reflected growing sales of our cooling products 
gross margins for the large systems segment declined in from the prior year as a result of increased costs within our service business  particularly in the us and europe  as well as increasing material costs on select product lines  including cooling and silcon products 
these increases were partially offset by volume driven cost improvements on symmetra phase products 
symmetra s increasing share of large systems revenue further enhanced the favorable impact of these cost improvements 
gross margins for the large systems segment improved in over the prior year principally due to a lowering of product costs  particularly lower manufacturing costs resulting from volume efficiencies achieved through factory consolidations  and capacity rationalization efforts that commenced in late as well as through material cost reductions from apc s supplier base 
our product cost reductions accounted for approximately basis points of the gross margin improvements in in the segment and were driven by material cost improvements and  to a lesser extent  manufacturing cost efficiencies 
other segment 
net sales for products in the other segment  consisting principally of mobile accessories and replacement batteries  decreased in fiscal year from due to a decrease in sales volumes of mobile accessories  partially offset by an increase in sales of replacement batteries 
net sales for this segment increased in over due mainly to organic growth of existing products  particularly replacement batteries  as well as growth from new mobile accessory products 
gross margins for the other segment improved in over the prior year 
strength in replacement battery sales and product cost reductions drove the year over year improvement 
these cost reductions favorably impacted gross margins in the other segment by approximately basis points in fiscal year gross margins for this segment also improved in over the prior year as a result of volume related efficiencies in cost  including improved efficiencies of recently introduced products  as well as a mix shift within the segment 
in addition  revenue and gross margin improvements in and over the respective prior years were enhanced in each of the operating segments by the favorable pricing impact of a weakening us dollar  particularly in europe 
operating expenses marketing  selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses in fiscal year were million or of net sales in fiscal year compared to million or of net sales in fiscal year and million or of net sales in fiscal year we continue to support our data center initiatives  with a primary focus on increasing the awareness of our existing and prospective customers  particularly in relation to our infrastruxure architecture 
the increases in total spending in and reflected ongoing sales and promotional efforts which involve expanding our sales and support teams  developing new channels such as manufacturer representatives and engineering contractors  and increasing sales and marketing support of our core reseller channels  as well as funding our educational efforts through high level customer and partner events 
also contributing to the increases in total spending were higher professional service costs in support of ongoing litigation and sarbanes oxley compliance 
the allowance for bad debts was of gross accounts receivable at december  compared to at december  accounts receivable balances outstanding over days represented of total receivables at december  compared to at december  we continue to experience strong collection performance 
write offs of uncollectable accounts represent less than of net sales 
commencing in august  we expanded apc s receivables insurance coverage to include us based sales 
as a result of this increased coverage  in the third quarter of we were able to reduce our allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately million 
a majority of international customer balances continue to be covered by receivables insurance 
research and development r d 
r d expenditures were million or of net sales in fiscal year  million or of net sales in fiscal year  and million or of net sales in fiscal year we continue to commit resources to support our investment in research and development with a primary focus on driving product innovation through increasing engineering efforts 
we believe that continued product innovation through development is necessary for our existing products to remain competitive in our markets  as well as creating opportunities from new product introductions 
the increases in total r d spending primarily reflect increased numbers of software and hardware engineers and costs associated with new product development and engineering support 
other income  net and income taxes other income  net 
other income is comprised principally of interest income 
although global interest income for fiscal year was lower than for  such income increased in the fourth quarter of over the fourth quarter of as a result of increasing interest rates and investments in foreign sourced commercial paper 
on a full year basis  the decrease reflected our strategic purchase of additional tax exempt securities as well as an overall decline in the bond market 
although average cash balances available for investment rose during fiscal year  interest income decreased from to due to lower short term interest rates throughout at december   apc had million of total cash and investments  down from million at december   all of which are stated at fair value 
this decrease reflected apc s third quarter repurchase on the open market of approximately million shares of its common stock  at an average price of per share totaling million  completing a program approved by apc s board of directors in june we manage apc s cash and investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing our return on the total investment portfolio 
we diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities with multiple investment brokers 
based on apc s investment portfolio and interest rates  at december   a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease of approximately million in our annual interest income 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rates were approximately   and in  and  respectively 
the substantial decrease in fiscal year from was principally attributable to a net tax credit of approximately million associated with the reversal of income tax provisioning resulting from the favorable outcome of recent tax audits by us federal and state taxing authorities 
in connection with the completion of the examination of its us federal tax returns  apc adjusted certain income tax related reserves established in prior years due to the expiration of the statute of limitations primarily related to transfer pricing reserves established for the philippine operations  offset by the additional tax due agreed to as a result of the examination  as well as an upward revision of reserves for years remaining open under the statute of limitations 
this revision relates primarily to transfer pricing matters concerning our manufacturing subsidiaries in india and china and our sales subsidiaries in europe 
in addition  apc recorded an additional tax credit to the third quarter tax rate with respect to the reversal of a tax reserve established for potential state taxes 
apc prevailed on a state tax appeal concerning a sales apportionment matter and this  along with the expiration of the statue of limitations for all years through  resulted in this tax credit 
the decrease from to also reflected tax savings from an increasing portion of taxable earnings anticipated to be generated from apc s operations in jurisdictions currently having lower income tax rates than the present us statutory income tax rate 
this shift resulted partially from our product transitions to lower cost  lower tax  manufacturing locations 
apc has tax holidays in china  india  and the philippines  which reduce or eliminate the income taxes paid in those countries 
a substantial portion of apc s tax holiday in the philippines expired in the third quarter of although this will have the effect of increasing apc s foreign taxes  apc s effective income tax rate will remain considerably lower than the us statutory federal corporate tax rate of american jobs creation act of repatriation of foreign earnings 
in october  the american jobs creation act of was enacted 
this act repealed the tax code s extraterritorial income eti exclusion in response to the world trade organization s challenge that the eti exclusion was a prohibited tax subsidy 
the repeal will be phased in through the act replaced the eti exclusion with a domestic deduction for domestic production activities effective for apc s tax year 
the act also provides for a temporary dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company s chief executive officer and approved by its board of directors 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
the maximum amount of apc s foreign earnings that qualify for the temporary deduction is million 
for apc  the one year period during which the qualifying distributions can be made is or no qualifying distributions were made during apc is in the process of evaluating whether it will repatriate any foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the jobs act and  if so  the amount that it will repatriate 
the range of reasonably possible amounts that apc is considering for repatriation  which would be eligible for the temporary deduction  is zero to million 
apc is awaiting the issuance of further regulatory guidance and passage of statutory technical corrections with respect to certain provisions in the jobs act prior to determining the amounts it will repatriate 
if such regulatory guidance or technical corrections are favorable  apc is likely to repatriate amounts in the high end of our range 
apc expects to determine the amounts and sources of foreign earnings to be repatriated  if any  during the third quarter of fiscal use of the funds will be governed by a domestic reinvestment plan  as required by the jobs act 
repatriation of the maximum amount eligible for the temporary deduction  which is million  could result in additional united states federal income tax expense  which apc currently estimates to be between zero and million  in fiscal repatriation also would substantially increase liquidity in the united states  although use of the additional liquidity would be restricted by the domestic reinvestment plan 
there would be a corresponding reduction in liquidity at apc s foreign subsidiaries 
some foreign subsidiaries may be required to borrow in order to repatriate their earnings to the us effects of inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on apc s operations 
liquidity and financial resources working capital working capital at december  was billion compared to billion at december  our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments position decreased to million at december  from million at december  apc s continued positive operating results allowed us to repurchase on the open market approximately million shares of our common stock  at an average price of per share totaling million  in the third quarter of  as well as pay quarterly dividends and continue to internally finance the capital investment  r d  sales and marketing spending required to expand our operations 
cash flows the table below summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december   and apc invests its excess cash principally in certificates of deposit  corporate bonds and notes  and us government agency securities 
apc also invests in auction rate securities 
auction rate securities have long term underlying maturities  however the market is highly liquid and the interest rates reset every seven  or days 
in prior years  apc classified a portion of its auction rate securities as cash equivalents  however such amounts have been reclassified as short term available for sale securities for all periods presented in this report million  million  and million at december   and  respectively 
in thousands net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities    net cash used in provided by financing activities   net change in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year   cash and cash equivalents at end of year    cash flows from operating activities 
our cash flows from operations for fiscal years and reflected higher profit levels as well as the favorable impact of increasing accounts payable and other liabilities  partially offset by increased inventory and higher accounts receivable balances consistent with our strong sales growth 
cash flows from investing activities 
our investing activities cash flows were used mainly for the purchase of available for sale and held to maturity securities and for capital spending  principally manufacturing and office equipment  purchased software applications  and building improvements 
cash available from operations resulted in net purchases of investments in fiscal years and  including the purchase of additional tax exempt securities 
our investment approach and the composition of our investment portfolio remained relatively constant overall with no investments having maturity dates greater than two years  except for the aforementioned auction rate securities 
cash flows from financing activities 
our cash flows from financing activities included the aforementioned million stock repurchase during the third quarter of as well as the payment of common stock dividends of approximately million and million during fiscal years and  respectively 
these outflows were partially offset in  and more than offset in and  by proceeds from issuances of common stock relating to employee stock plans during each of the periods presented 
inventories worldwide inventories were million at december   up from million at december  higher levels of on hand raw materials and finished goods were required during and to meet increasing current and anticipated demand  particularly infrastruxure demand  as well as to manage the supply chain requirements associated with continuing transfers of production of a wide range of small and large systems products to and among our low cost manufacturing regions 
in addition  we increased our inventory levels of price sensitive materials to hedge against the risk of current and anticipated commodity cost trends  as well as to support continuing new product introductions 
despite increasing inventory levels  inventory levels as a percentage of quarterly sales were in the fourth quarter of  down from in the third quarter of and in the fourth quarter of provision for excess inventory 
additionally  third quarter gross margins included the effects of a million incremental charge for excess inventory related to specifically identified finished goods and raw materials inventories deemed obsolete as the result of recently commenced efforts to reduce the number of unique product offerings in several of our product lines  as well as the result of new product introductions 
there were no additional inventory charges  other than apc s standard provisioning  during the fourth quarter of or during fiscal years and product recall 
in early  we announced a product recall of back ups cs and models  due to potential safety issues 
prior to announcing the recall  apc received eight reports worldwide of units overheating  resulting in the melting of the unit s outer casing  six of which occurred in the united states 
three of the reported incidents resulted in minor property damage  no injuries have been reported 
the total number of affected devices recalled worldwide is approximately million with approximately  devices recalled in the united states 
the recall is limited to two specific models in apc s back ups cs product line  the back ups cs and the back ups cs  in both volt and volt models 
the affected units were manufactured between november and december and were sold primarily through computer and electrical distribution  catalog and retail outlets worldwide 
in the fourth quarter of  apc accrued a current liability and recognized additional warranty expense  classified in cost of goods sold  of million 
based upon repair cost and return rate experience to date as well as then current estimates of remaining costs to be incurred  apc projected that aggregate costs for the recall would be less than originally estimated 
to reflect this change  cost of goods sold was reduced by million in the third quarter of as of december   apc had incurred approximately of currently estimated total recall costs 
our estimation of remaining recall costs of million  comprised of million for the us and million for international geographies  continues to be subject to actual return rates and per unit repair costs which can vary by country as well as estimates for other recall related costs expected to be incurred 
we expect that future amounts will not differ materially from our current estimates 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in millions operating lease obligations apc s non cancelable operating leases  primarily for warehousing and office space  expire at various dates through these leases contain renewal options for periods ranging from one to seven years and require apc to pay its proportionate share of utilities  taxes  and insurance 
apc is not able to determine the aggregate amount of purchase orders that represent contractual obligations for the purchase of goods and services  as such purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this disclosure  contractual obligations for the purchase of goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on apc and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  the approximate timing of the transaction  and contain no provisions allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
our purchase orders for raw materials or purchased finished products are based on our current manufacturing needs and or demand forecasts and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or finished products specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
capital expenditures and capital commitments during and  our capital expenditures  net of capital grants  amounted to approximately million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of manufacturing and office equipment  purchased software applications  and building improvements 
capital spending in and focused on funding additional equipment needs and improving existing factories  principally in the us  india  ireland  the philippines  denmark  and china  as well as continuing investment in information technologies 
capital spending in decreased from prior year levels  reflecting our focused efforts to control and reduce capital spending and rationalize our overall production capacity which included our first quarter decision to consolidate our philippines based manufacturing operations in the province of cavite 
substantially all of apc s net capital expenditures were financed from available operating cash 
also refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we have dedicated significant efforts to rationalize our overall manufacturing capacity over the past three years and we will continue to plan for future capacity requirements based on the assumed continued acceptance and demand for our products in the specific market segments they were designed to address 
we currently expect that capital spending will be between million and million in  compared to million in we expect that most of the capital spending for will go toward maintaining  upgrading  and expanding current manufacturing capacity  as well as investing to upgrade current hardware and software office technologies 
we had no material capital commitments during fiscal years  and  or at december  and apc has agreements with the industrial development authority of ireland  otherwise known as the ida 
under these agreements  we receive grant monies for costs incurred for machinery  equipment  and building improvements for our galway and castlebar facilities 
these grants are equal to and  respectively  of such costs up to a maximum of million for galway and million for castlebar 
such grant monies are subject to apc meeting certain employment goals and maintaining operations in ireland until termination of the respective agreements 
under separate agreements with the ida  we receive direct reimbursement of training costs at our galway and castlebar facilities for up to  and  respectively  per new employee hired 
also refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
apc also has an agreement with the ida for a research and development grant towards the costs of a project for the development of software products 
the availability of the grant is contingent on meeting certain milestones in the progress of the project as well as meeting certain employment goals on the project within the galway facility 
the amount of grant assistance available on satisfaction of all conditions is of the eligible expenditure to a maximum of  at december   no grant claims had been claimed or received 
borrowing facilities and financial commitments at december  and  apc had available for future borrowings million under an unsecured  non committed line of credit agreement at a floating interest rate equal to the bank s cost of funds rate plus 
no borrowings were outstanding under this facility during fiscal years  and  or at december  and apc had no significant financial commitments  other than those required in the normal course of business  during fiscal years  and  or at december  and off balance sheet arrangements apc had no significant off balance sheet arrangements during fiscal years  and  or at december  and american jobs creation act of repatriation of foreign earnings 
in october  the american jobs creation act of was enacted 
this act repealed the tax code s extraterritorial income eti exclusion in response to the world trade organization s challenge that the eti exclusion was a prohibited tax subsidy 
the repeal will be phased in through the act replaced the eti exclusion with a domestic deduction for domestic production activities effective for apc s tax year 
the act also provides for a temporary dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company s chief executive officer and approved by its board of directors 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
the maximum amount of apc s foreign earnings that qualify for the temporary deduction is million 
for apc  the one year period during which the qualifying distributions can be made is or no qualifying distributions were made during apc is in the process of evaluating whether it will repatriate any foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the jobs act and  if so  the amount that it will repatriate 
the range of reasonably possible amounts that apc is considering for repatriation  which would be eligible for the temporary deduction  is zero to million 
apc is awaiting the issuance of further regulatory guidance and passage of statutory technical corrections with respect to certain provisions in the jobs act prior to determining the amounts it will repatriate 
if such regulatory guidance or technical corrections are favorable  apc is likely to repatriate amounts in the high end of our range 
apc expects to determine the amounts and sources of foreign earnings to be repatriated  if any  during the third quarter of fiscal use of the funds will be governed by a domestic reinvestment plan  as required by the jobs act 
repatriation of the maximum amount eligible for the temporary deduction  which is million  could result in additional united states federal income tax expense  which apc currently estimates to be between zero and million  in fiscal repatriation also would substantially increase liquidity in the united states  although use of the additional liquidity would be restricted by the domestic reinvestment plan 
there would be a corresponding reduction in liquidity at apc s foreign subsidiaries 
some foreign subsidiaries may be required to borrow in order to repatriate their earnings to the us quarterly cash dividends in june  apc s board of directors approved initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock 
dividends of per share were declared and paid in each subsequent quarter through the second quarter of in june  apc s board of directors approved a increase in its quarterly cash dividend raising the payout to per share 
dividends of per share were declared and paid in the third and fourth quarters of on february   a quarterly dividend of per share was declared  payable on march  to shareholders of record as of february  it is the intention of the board of directors to pay a comparable quarterly dividend on a going forward basis contingent upon continued capital availability and a determination that cash dividends continue to be in the best interests of apc and its shareholders 
apc has historically generated annual cash flows from operating activities as a result of strong operating results and  at times  improvement in working capital 
we believe that current internal cash flows together with available cash  available credit facilities or  if needed  the proceeds from the sale of additional equity  will be sufficient to support anticipated capital spending  dividend payments  and other working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
stock repurchase program during the third quarter of  apc repurchased on the open market approximately million shares of its common stock  at an average price of per share totaling million  completing a program approved by apc s board of directors in june no further repurchases will be made under this program 
the repurchased shares have been deemed authorized but unissued shares 
in march  apc also returned its  treasury shares to an authorized but not issued status 
foreign currency activity we invoice our customers in various currencies 
realized and unrealized transaction gains or losses are included in the results of operations and are measured based upon the effect of changes in exchange rates on the actual or expected amount of functional currency cash flows 
transaction gains and losses were not material to the results of operations in  and the table below summarizes information on balances that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates and presents such amounts in us dollar equivalents 
december  december  accounts receivable liabilities accounts receivable liabilities in thousands us dollar functional currency     swiss franc functional currency     apc also had non trade receivables denominated in euros of approximately us million and us million at december  and  respectively 
we continually review our foreign exchange exposure and consider various risk management techniques  including the netting of foreign currency receipts and disbursements  rate protection agreements with customers vendors and derivatives arrangements  including foreign exchange contracts 
we presently do not utilize rate protection agreements or derivative arrangements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  also refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the judgments and estimates underlying all of our accounting policies  including those related to revenue recognition  product returns  bad debts  inventories  impairment of long lived assets  deferred tax valuation allowances  restructuring reserves and contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
materially different results in the amount and timing of our actual results for any period could occur if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
in general  revenue is recognized when title has passed at the time of delivery of product for all of our operating segments as stipulated by the delivery terms for the sales transactions 
in addition  prior to revenue recognition  we require persuasive evidence of the arrangement  that the price is fixed or determinable  and that collectibility is reasonably assured 
installation is not applicable for small systems and other segment products based on the nature of the products sold 
generally  revenue associated with large systems sales is also recognized at the time of delivery and or installation pursuant to the delivery and or installation terms 
delivery terms vary  but often include origin based terms eg  fob shipping point and ex works and destination based terms eg  ddu ddp delivered duty unpaid delivered duty paid 
certain large systems product lines and  at times  one product line included in the small systems segment  require electrical hardwire installation or duct installation which is performed by the customer or their contracted licensed contractor electrician 
where we do not perform such installation  revenue recognition at the time of delivery is proper as customer acceptance of the unit is not required 
also  payment by the customer is not contingent upon installation of the product 
we offer additional services to customers depending on the type of product the customer has purchased  including on site services  installation consulting services  remote monitoring services  power audit services  and network integration services 
revenue is recognized at the time services are provided or is deferred and recognized over the service period where applicable 
the fair value of these services are based upon the rates that we charge customers in separately negotiated transactions and such services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered product 
for all sales  except those completed over the internet  we use a binding purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through certain customers are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes a customer specified acceptance provision  acceptance generally occurs at our factory prior to delivery 
as we continue to introduce new products in  we anticipate that installation and customer acceptance provisions may become more common  and therefore increasingly significant for determining delivery and performance and consequently our entitlement to recognize revenue 
estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities allowances for sales returns  doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence and product recall  and assessment of the probability of the outcome of our current litigation 
significant management judgments that affect the application of our revenue policy also include estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and channel inventories when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we provide limited rights of return to distributors and retailers for our small systems product lines 
we provide appropriate reserves for returns at the time that related revenue is recognized  based on historical patterns of returns and contractual provisions in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  and us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
returns of large systems products generally do not occur 
historically  returns have represented approximately of gross sales and have not differed significantly from prior estimates 
similarly  we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable balances in view of customer credit worthiness  customer concentrations  historical bad debts  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
commencing in august  we expanded apc s receivables insurance coverage to include us based sales 
a majority of international customer balances continue to be covered by receivables insurance 
historically  bad debts have been less than of net sales 
our inventory reserve estimate methodology involves quantifying the total inventory position having potential loss exposure 
loss exposure generally results from several business factors  including product or component discontinuance  unplanned changes in demand  product design changes  and factory transitions 
quantifying such loss exposure is the result of combining the cost of inventories specifically identified as having little or no opportunity for sale or use thus available for physical disposition plus the cost of inventories having a high risk of no future sale or use based upon an analysis of on hand quantities compared to historical and anticipated future sale or use 
we maintain an on going business process for the physical disposition of inventories previously identified 
inventory write offs occur at the time of physical disposition 
inventories  once reserved  are not written back up as such reserve adjustments are considered to be a permanent decrease to the cost basis of the excess or obsolete inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in early  we announced a product recall of back ups cs and models  due to potential safety issues 
prior to announcing the recall  apc received eight reports worldwide of units overheating  resulting in the melting of the unit s outer casing  six of which occurred in the united states 
three of the reported incidents resulted in minor property damage  no injuries have been reported 
the total number of affected devices recalled worldwide is approximately million with approximately  devices recalled in the united states 
the recall is limited to two specific models in apc s back ups cs product line  the back ups cs and the back ups cs  in both volt and volt models 
the affected units were manufactured between november and december and were sold primarily through computer and electrical distribution  catalog and retail outlets worldwide 
in the fourth quarter of  apc accrued a current liability and recognized additional warranty expense  classified in cost of goods sold  of million 
based upon repair cost and return rate experience to date as well as then current estimates of remaining costs to be incurred  apc projected that aggregate costs for the recall would be less than originally estimated 
to reflect this change  cost of goods sold was reduced by million in the third quarter of as of december   apc had incurred approximately of currently estimated total recall costs 
our estimation of remaining recall costs of million  comprised of million for the us and million for international geographies  continues to be subject to actual return rates and per unit repair costs which can vary by country as well as estimates for other recall related costs expected to be incurred 
the most significant risks associated with our return rate assumptions include varying degrees of product recall regulation by geography as well as varying consumer awareness levels and access to timely recall information 
actual per unit repair cost includes principally transportation costs which will be influenced by the proximity of customer locations to the service center location as well as the priority level of delivery requirements 
we expect that actual future amounts will not differ materially from our current estimates 
we are  and may in the future become  involved in litigation involving our business  products or operations 
for pending claims for which there is an estimatable range of loss greater than zero  we record the best estimate of liability within the range 
if no point within the range is considered the best estimate  we record the minimum estimated liability 
because of uncertainties related to the identifiable range of loss on any pending claims  we may be unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending claims and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
the litigation process is inherently uncertain and includes the risk of an unexpected  unfavorable result 
we may be materially adversely impacted by any such litigation 
valuation of long lived tangible and intangible assets including goodwill 
we assess the impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets on an ongoing basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
should our assessment of long lived and amortizable intangible assets suggest impairment  we would determine recoverability based on an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows resulting from our use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant technological changes  which would render equipment and manufacturing process  obsolete 
we evaluate each of our reporting units with goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
impairment losses are determined based upon the excess of carrying amounts over discounted expected future cash flows of the underlying business 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
expectations about future taxable income incorporate numerous assumptions about actions  elections and strategies to minimize income taxes in future years 
our ability to take such actions  make preferred elections and implement tax planning strategies may be adversely impacted by enacted changes in tax laws and or tax rates  as well as successful challenges by tax authorities resulting from differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations 
american jobs creation act of repatriation of foreign earnings 
in october  the american jobs creation act of was enacted 
this act repealed the tax code s extraterritorial income eti exclusion in response to the world trade organization s challenge that the eti exclusion was a prohibited tax subsidy 
the repeal will be phased in through the act replaced the eti exclusion with a domestic deduction for domestic production activities effective for apc s tax year 
the act also provides for a temporary dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company s chief executive officer and approved by its board of directors 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
the maximum amount of apc s foreign earnings that qualify for the temporary deduction is million 
for apc  the one year period during which the qualifying distributions can be made is or no qualifying distributions were made during apc is in the process of evaluating whether it will repatriate any foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the jobs act and  if so  the amount that it will repatriate 
the range of reasonably possible amounts that apc is considering for repatriation  which would be eligible for the temporary deduction  is zero to million 
apc is awaiting the issuance of further regulatory guidance and passage of statutory technical corrections with respect to certain provisions in the jobs act prior to determining the amounts it will repatriate 
if such regulatory guidance or technical corrections are favorable  apc is likely to repatriate amounts in the high end of our range 
apc expects to determine the amounts and sources of foreign earnings to be repatriated  if any  during the third quarter of fiscal use of the funds will be governed by a domestic reinvestment plan  as required by the jobs act 
repatriation of the maximum amount eligible for the temporary deduction  which is million  could result in additional united states federal income tax expense  which apc currently estimates to be between zero and million  in fiscal repatriation also would substantially increase liquidity in the united states  although use of the additional liquidity would be restricted by the domestic reinvestment plan 
there would be a corresponding reduction in liquidity at apc s foreign subsidiaries 
some foreign subsidiaries may be required to borrow in order to repatriate their earnings to the us apc is routinely under audit by federal  foreign  state  or local authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes 
these audits include questioning the timing and amount of deductions  the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal  foreign  state  and local tax laws 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  we often accrue for probable exposures 
to the extent apc were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or were to be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  apc s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
to the extent we believe that recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december  and  we provided a valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses generated in through for the start up and continuing operations of brazilian operations  because of uncertainty regarding their realizability 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards share based payment 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of statement no 
as amended by no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement no 
r supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
this statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  and will be effective for apc for the third and fourth fiscal quarters of statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 
the modified prospective method requires compensation cost to be recognized beginning with the statement s effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
apc has yet to determine which method to use in adopting statement r 
as permitted by statement  apc currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on apc s results of operations  although it will have no impact on apc s overall financial position 
apc is evaluating statement r and has not yet determined the amount of stock option expense which will be incurred in future periods 
inventory costs 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs 
statement requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs always be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   we will adopt this statement on january  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
american jobs creation act of repatriation of foreign earnings 
fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  provides guidance under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
the jobs act was enacted on october  fsp states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying statement no 
apc has not yet completed evaluating the impact of the repatriation provisions 
accordingly  as provided for in fsp  apc has not adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the jobs act

our annual and quarterly results are likely to be volatile 
our annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including costs to comply with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of are greater than currently anticipated  ramp up  expansion and rationalization of global manufacturing capacity  our ability to effectively align operating expenses and production capacity with the current demand environment  volatility in general world economic conditions  and  in particular  the possibility that the pc and related markets decline more dramatically than currently anticipated  the growth rates in the power protection industry and related industries  including but not limited to the pc  server  networking  telecommunications and enterprise hardware industries  competitive factors and pricing pressures  product mix changes and the potential negative impact on gross margins from such changes  changes in the seasonality of demand patterns  inventory risks due to shifts in market demand  component cost trends  as well as supply constraints  shortages  and quality  risks of nonpayment of accounts receivable  timing of orders from  and shipments to  customers  timing of new product introductions and the market acceptance of those products  changes in manufacturing costs  factors associated with international operations  the potential impact of complying with changing environmental regulations  natural disasters  and labor disputes  acts of terrorism  war and political instability 
we currently compete with several firms providing power protection and related products and services and expect competition to increase in the future  which could affect our revenue and profitability 
we believe that we are one of less than ten global companies providing a full range of ups products and services worldwide 
the ups  power protection and related industries  however  are highly competitive on both a worldwide basis and a regional geographic basis 
we compete  and will continue to compete  with several us and foreign firms  both on a worldwide basis and in various geographical regions  and within individual product and application niches 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and a number of companies that may enter our existing or future markets 
increased competition could adversely affect our revenue and profitability through price reductions and loss of market share 
the principal competitive factors in our products include product performance and quality  marketing and access to distribution channels  customer services  and product design and price 
some of our current and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources than we have 
we may not be able to continue to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors 
technological innovation  or failure to alter our products to meet the demands of technological innovation  could seriously harm our business 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products 
we may not be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or enhancing our existing products or in responding effectively to technological changes  new standards or product announcements by competitors 
the timely availability of new products and enhancements  and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success 
delays in such availability or a lack of market acceptance could have an adverse effect on our business 
additionally  there may be technological innovation that eliminates or reduces the need for our products 
defects in our products could seriously harm our business 
our products may have defects despite testing internally or by current or potential customers 
these defects could result in product returns or recalls and loss or delay in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results  or financial condition 
in early  apc announced a product recall of back ups cs and models  due to potential safety issues 
prior to announcing the recall  apc received eight reports worldwide of units overheating  resulting in the melting of the unit s outer casing  six of which occurred in the united states 
three of the reported incidents resulted in minor property damage  no injuries have been reported 
the total number of affected devices recalled worldwide is approximately million with approximately  devices recalled in the united states 
the recall is limited to two specific models in apc s back ups cs product line  the back ups cs and the back ups cs  in both volt and volt models 
the affected units were manufactured between november and december and were sold primarily through computer and electrical distribution  catalog and retail outlets worldwide 
in the fourth quarter of  apc accrued a current liability and recognized additional warranty expense  classified in cost of goods sold  of million 
based upon repair cost and return rate experience to date as well as then current estimates of remaining costs to be incurred  apc projected that aggregate costs for the recall would be less than originally estimated 
to reflect this change  cost of goods sold was reduced by million in the third quarter of as of december   apc had incurred approximately of currently estimated total recall costs 
our estimation of remaining recall costs of million  comprised of million for the us and million for international geographies  continues to be subject to actual return rates and per unit repair costs which can vary by country as well as estimates for other recall related costs expected to be incurred 
we expect that future amounts will not differ materially from our current estimates 
loss of any of our key personnel could seriously harm our business 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of key management  sales  marketing  research and development and manufacturing personnel  many of whom we would have difficulty replacing 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled hardware and software engineers  and management  sales  and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
because we depend on foreign operations and revenues  we are exposed to currency fluctuations  import barriers and other risks related to conducting foreign operations 
we manufacture and market our products worldwide through several foreign subsidiaries  distributors  and resellers 
our worldwide operations are subject to the risks normally associated with foreign operations including  but not limited to customer and vendor financial instability  volatility in general world economic conditions  the disruption of markets  changes in export or import laws  restrictions on currency exchanges  potentially negative tax consequences  longer payment terms  acts of labor disputes  war  terrorism  or political instability  natural disasters  and the modification or introduction of government policies with potentially adverse effects 
international sales  which are both direct and indirect sales to customers outside the us  accounted for approximately   and  of our net sales in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 
we invoice our customers in various currencies 
to date  we do not use any rate protection agreements or derivative agreements to hedge any foreign exchange exposure 
accordingly  we may be exposed to exchange losses based upon currency exchange rate fluctuations  which losses could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
a significant portion of products in our small systems and large systems reportable operating segments are manufactured in foreign locations  particularly developing countries such as brazil  china  india  and the philippines  which subject apc to a number of economic and other risks 
the small systems have particular exposure to the philippines  a country which is experiencing political and financial instability 
disruption of manufacturing efforts in these international facilities could materially adversely impact our ability to fulfill customer orders and potentially result in the loss of business 
because our business relies upon a variety of computer systems to operate effectively  the failure or disruption of  or latent defects in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business 
apc is a highly automated company whose efficient and effective operation relies on a variety of information systems  including e mail  enterprise resource planning  electronic data interchange  customer resource management and e commerce systems 
disruption in the operation of these systems  or difficulties in maintaining or upgrading these systems  could have an adverse effect on our business 
difficulties that we have encountered  or may encounter  in connection with our implementation and use of our computer systems  including human error or our reliance on  or a failure or disruption of  or latent defects in  such systems  could adversely affect our order management and fulfillment  financial reporting and supply chain management processes  and any such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our reliance on sole source suppliers may result in product delays or price increases 
we currently obtain certain components of our products and certain finished products from sole sources 
in the future  our suppliers may not be able to meet our demand for components and products in a timely and cost effective manner 
our inability to secure and qualify alternative sources of supply in a timely manner may disrupt our ability to fulfill customer orders 
we generally purchase these sole source components and products using purchase orders and have no guaranteed supply arrangements with the suppliers 
in addition  the availability of many of these components and products is dependent in part on our ability to provide the suppliers with accurate forecasts of our future requirements 
however  our operating results and customer relationships could be materially adversely affected by either an increase in prices for  or an interruption or reduction in supply of  any key components and products 
we have a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights  others could infringe on or misappropriate our propriety rights and information 
our success will depend  to a large extent  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of contractual rights  trade secrets  patents  trademarks  and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights 
although we own certain patents  and we have applied  and in the future we may apply  for patents  our intellectual property protection may not be sufficient to prevent competitors from developing similar technology 
moreover  in the absence of patent protection  our business may be adversely affected by competitors which independently develop functionally equivalent technology 
our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
we attempt to ensure that our products and processes do not infringe upon third party patents and other proprietary rights  but from time to time third parties have alleged  and in the future may allege  such infringement 
if third parties allege or determine infringement  we may not prevail in such a challenge 
furthermore  if infringement is determined  we may not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to identify and successfully integrate acquisitions  our ability to expand and our financial results could suffer 
we have limited experience in integrating acquired companies or technologies into our operations 
we may from time to time pursue the acquisition of other companies  assets  products or technologies 
we may not be able to integrate successfully products  technologies  distribution channels  key personnel and businesses of acquired companies into our business or product offerings 
in addition  the integration of acquired companies may adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
further  these acquired companies  assets  products or technologies may not contribute significantly to our sales or earnings  and the sales and earnings from acquired businesses may be adversely affected by the integration process or other factors 
if we are not successful in the integration of such acquired businesses  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
in addition  we may not be able to identify and consummate suitable acquisition transactions in the future 
our stock price could be volatile  which could cause you to lose part or all of your investment 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products developed by us or our competitors  and labor disputes  acts of war  terrorism and political instability and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our tax rate depends on earnings derived from certain foreign manufacturing operations 
our tax rate is heavily dependent upon the proportion of earnings that we derive from our ireland and philippines manufacturing operations and our ability to reinvest those earnings permanently outside the united states 
if the earnings of these operations as a percentage of our total earnings were to decline significantly from anticipated levels  or should our ability to reinvest these earnings be reduced  our effective tax rate would exceed the currently estimated rate for we have tax holidays in china  india  and the philippines  which reduce or eliminate the income taxes paid in those countries 
a substantial portion of our tax holiday in the philippines expired in the third quarter of although this will have the effect of increasing our foreign taxes  our effective income tax rate will remain considerably lower than the us statutory federal corporate tax rate of 
in addition  we believe that further tax savings can be achieved by implementing further tax planning strategies 
if we are unable to successfully implement such strategies  our overall effective tax rate could increase 
in addition  should our intercompany transfer pricing with respect to our ireland or philippines manufacturing operations require significant adjustment due to audits or regulatory changes  our overall effective tax rate could increase 
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may materially adversely impact our business 
effective internal controls are necessary for apc to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud 
if apc cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent fraud  our brand and operating results could be harmed 
pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting  including management s assessment of the effectiveness of such control 
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations  including the possibility of human error  the circumvention or overriding of controls  or fraud 
therefore  even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements 
in addition  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
if apc fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls  including any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or if apc experiences difficulties in their implementation  apc s business and operating results could be harmed  apc could fail to meet its reporting obligations  and there could be a material adverse effect on apc s stock price 
we cannot provide any assurance that current laws  or any laws enacted in the future  will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operations are subject to laws  rules  regulations  including environmental regulations  government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conducts business 
changes in such laws  rules  regulations  policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products  which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results 
in addition  we must comply with new regulations restricting apc s ability to include lead and certain other substances in its products 
if apc does not comply with applicable laws  rules and regulations  apc could be subject to costs and liabilities and its business may be adversely impacted 
we are  and may become  involved in litigation  which could materially harm our business 
we are  and may in the future become  involved in litigation involving our business  products or operations 
the litigation process is inherently uncertain and includes the risk of an unexpected  unfavorable result 
were an unfavorable result to occur  it is possible that we could be materially adversely impacted by any such litigation
