item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we own and operate full service  casual dining restaurants 
as of december   we operated restaurants 
in addition to these units  there were several limited menu restaurants and other properties as described in item business  and two restaurants that were closed temporarily for renovation 
during  we completed a series of relatively small acquisitions  including separate acquisitions of several well known individual upscale houston restaurants  ocean journey a acre aquarium complex in denver  colorado the holiday inn on the beach in galveston  texas  and the galveston flagship hotel subject to an existing lease  for an aggregate cash purchase price of all such acquisitions of approximately million  plus the assumption of an million non recourse long term note payable 
these acquisitions included certain future commitments as described in notes to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies in the paragraph titled building commitments 
the estimated cost of such future commitments are included in the contractual obligations table amounts under other long term obligations  that is included within this item in february  we acquired seafood restaurants located primarily in michigan and florida in connection with the acquisition of ca muer  inc  the muer acquisition 
in august  we purchased chart house seafood restaurants  located primarily on the east and west coasts of the united states 
these acquisitions included plans for the redevelopment of ten additional lower profitability restaurants  which were also then acquired  into joe s crab shack restaurants  and the sale or disposal of approximately six additional acquired  but non strategic locations 
in october  we purchased texas based saltgrass steak house restaurants 
the specialty growth division is primarily engaged in operating complementary entertainment and hospitality activities  such as miscellaneous beverage carts and various kiosks  amusement rides and games and some associated limited hotel properties  generally at locations in conjunction with our core restaurant operations 
the total assets  revenues  and operating profits of these complementary specialty business activities are considered not material to the overall business and below the threshold of a separate reportable business segment under sfas no 
the company is in the business of operating restaurants and the above mentioned complementary activities 
the company does not engage in real estate operations other than those associated with the ownership and operation of its business 
the company owns a fee interest owns the land and building in a number of properties underlying its businesses  but it does not engage in real estate sales or real estate management in any

the chief executive officer  who is responsible for the company s operations  reviews and evaluates both core and non core business activities and results  and determines financial and management resource allocations and investments for all business activities 
the restaurant industry is intensely competitive and is affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national  regional  and local economic conditions and demographic trends 
the performance of individual restaurants may be affected by factors such as traffic patterns  demographic considerations  marketing  weather conditions  and the type  number  and location of competing restaurants 
we have many well established competitors with greater financial resources  larger marketing and advertising budgets  and longer histories of operation than ours  including competitors already established in regions where we are planning to expand  as well as competitors planning to expand in the same regions 
we face significant competition from mid priced  full service  casual dining restaurants offering or promoting seafood and other types and varieties of cuisine 
our competitors include national  regional  and local chains as well as local owner operated restaurants 
we also compete with other restaurants and retail establishments for restaurant sites 
we intend to pursue an acquisition strategy 
in this report  we have made forward looking statements 
our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainty  including without limitation  our ability to continue our expansion strategy  our ability to make projected capital expenditures  as well as potential acquisitions of other restaurants  restaurant concepts and lines of businesses in other sectors of the hospitality and entertainment industries  general market conditions  competition  and pricing 
forward looking statements include statements regarding future capital expenditures including the amount and nature thereof  business strategy and measures to implement that strategy  competitive strengths  goals  expansion and growth of our business and operations  future commodity prices  availability of food products  materials and employees  consumer perceptions of food safety  changes in local  regional and national economic conditions  the effectiveness of our marketing efforts  changing demographics surrounding our restaurants  the effect of tax laws  and any changes therein  same store sales  earnings guidance  the seasonality of our business  weather and acts of god  food  labor  fuel and utilities costs  plans  references to future success  the risks described in risk factors as well as other statements which include words such as anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  expect  intend and other similar expressions 
although we believe that the assumptions underlying our forward looking statements are reasonable  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and  therefore  we cannot assure you that the forward looking statements included in this report will prove to be accurate 
in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward looking statements  the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved 
restatement in late and early  a number of companies within the restaurant industry announced adjustments to their accounting for leases and the depreciation of leasehold improvements 
in consultation with our current and prior external auditors  we also determined that an adjustment was necessary to modify our accounting in these areas 
as a result  we have restated our consolidated financial statements for years prior to historically  unless otherwise deemed immaterial  we recorded rent expense on a straight line basis over the initial non cancelable lease term  with the term commencing when actual rent payments began 
we depreciated our buildings  leasehold improvements and other long lived assets on those properties over a period that included both the initial non cancelable lease term and options  where the failure to renew would result in economic penalty or the useful life of the assets  if shorter 
we previously believed that these longstanding accounting treatments were appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles 
we now have restated our financial statements to recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
the lease term commences on the date when we become legally obligated under the lease regardless of when actual rent payments begin

the impairment charge in fiscal resulted from sales declines in one particular restaurant  combined with deterioration in the specific restaurant s profitability and management s lowered outlook for improvement in such specific property

table of contents liquidity and capital resources in december  the company refinanced its existing revolving credit facility and existing senior notes by entering into a new five year million bank credit facility and a six year million term loan 
the bank credit facility matures in december and the term loan matures in december interest on the bank credit facility is payable monthly or quarterly at libor or the bank s base rate plus a financing spread 
interest on the term loan is payable quarterly at libor plus a financing spread 
the company s financing spread under both the bank credit facility and the term loan is currently for libor borrowings and for base rate borrowings 
as of december   the company had approximately million available under the existing credit facility for expansion and working capital purposes 
concurrent with the closing of the bank credit facility and term loan in december  the company also issued million in senior notes through a private placement offering 
the senior notes are general unsecured obligations of the company and mature december interest is payable semi annually at 
net proceeds from the bank credit facility and senior notes totaled million and were used to repay all outstanding liabilities under the existing credit facility and senior notes 
these debt repayments resulted in a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of the bank credit facility and term loan are secured by substantially all real and personal property of subsidiaries of the company  and governed by certain financial covenants  including minimum fixed charge  net worth  and financial leverage ratios as well as limitations on dividend payments  capital expenditures and other restricted payments as defined in the agreements 
in october  the company refinanced a previous bank credit facility by issuing long term notes totaling million through a private placement of debt and amending and extending the existing bank credit facility to a four year million revolving credit facility the former bank credit facility later increased to million 
the long term notes had maturities ranging from october through october  and the former bank credit facility matured in october interest on the long term notes was paid quarterly at an average rate of 
interest on the former bank credit facility was payable monthly or quarterly at libor or the bank s base rate plus a financing spread 
the former bank credit facility  long term notes  and all future related liabilities were paid down in full with the proceeds from the december refinancing 
a wholly owned subsidiary of ours assumed an million non recourse  long term note payable due may in connection with an asset purchase in march principal and interest payments under this note aggregate  monthly 
during the year ended december   the company repurchased million of common stock 
in september  the company authorized an open market stock repurchase program for million 
in october  the company authorized a million stock repurchase program 
in early  the company authorized a million stock repurchase program 
the company expects to make opportunistic repurchases of its common stock 
working capital increased from a deficit of million as of december  to million as of december  primarily due to issuance of the senior notes and a refinancing of the company s bank debt in december cash flow to fund future operations  new restaurant development  and acquisitions will be generated from operations and available capacity under the company s current bank credit facility 
in  the company spent million on capital expenditures including opening new units 
an additional five chart house units were purchased out of a master lease agreement for million 
also included in cash flow from investing activities was the payment to settle all future contingent obligations related to the financial performance of the saltgrass steak house restaurants and settlement of certain acquisition 
table of contents integration costs 
in  we expect to spend approximately million including opening units 
we also plan to spend an additional million plus certain working capital liabilities in or to complete our pending acquisition of the golden nugget hotel and casino in downtown las vegas  nevada 
as of december   the company had contractual obligations as described below 
these obligations are expected to be funded primarily through cash on hand  cash flow from operations  working capital  the bank credit facility and additional financing sources in the normal course of business operations 
contractual obligations in thousands thereafter operating leases long term debt unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total cash obligations other commercial commitments in thousands thereafter line of credit standby letters of credit total commercial commitments from time to time  we review opportunities for restaurant acquisitions and investments in the hospitality  entertainment  amusement  food service and facilities management and other industries 
our exercise of any such investment opportunity may impact our development plans and capital expenditures 
we believe that adequate sources of capital are available to fund our business activities through december  as a primary result of establishing long term borrowings  the company will incur higher interest expense in the future 
however  the company has mitigated a portion of the higher interest expense by entering into a fair value hedge with a notional amount of million  whereby the company swapped higher fixed interest rates of the senior notes due for floating interest rates equal to six month libor plus a financing spread of since april  we have paid an annual per share dividend  declared and paid in quarterly amounts 
the company increased the annual dividend to per share in april seasonality and quarterly results our business is seasonal in nature 
our reduced winter volumes cause revenues and  to a greater degree  operating profits to be lower in the first and fourth quarters than in other quarters 
we have and continue to open restaurants in highly seasonal tourist markets 
joe s crab shack restaurants tend to experience even greater seasonality and sensitivity to weather than our other restaurant concepts 
periodically  our sales and profitability may be negatively affected by adverse weather 
the timing of unit openings can and will affect quarterly results 
critical accounting policies restaurant and other properties are reviewed on a property by property basis for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
the recoverability of properties that are to be held and used is measured by comparison of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the carrying amount of the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  an impairment charge is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
properties to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value  reduced for estimated disposal costs  and are included in other current assets 

table of contents we operate approximately properties and periodically we expect to experience unanticipated individual unit deterioration in revenues and profitability  on a short term and occasionally longer term basis 
when such events occur and we determine that the associated assets are impaired  we will record an asset impairment expense in the quarter such determination is made 
due to our average restaurant net investment cost  generally excluding the owned land component  of approximately million  such amounts could be significant when and if they occur 
however  such asset impairment expense does not affect our financial liquidity  and is usually excluded from many valuation model calculations 
the company maintains a large deductible insurance policy related to general liability and workers compensation coverage 
predetermined loss limits have been arranged with insurance companies to limit the company s per occurrence cash outlay 
accrued expenses and other liabilities include estimated costs to settle unpaid claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims using actuarial methodologies 
we follow the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options  and as such do not record compensation expense related to amounts outstanding 
effective with the quarter ending september   we will expense compensation related to stock options in accordance with sfas r 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities in january this interpretation provides guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  variable interest entities 
variable interest entities are entities that lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or lack sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin r requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if that company is obligated to absorb the majority of the entity s expected losses or entitled to receive the majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs which amended arb the statement clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials should be recognized as current period charges  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of non monetary assets 
this statement amends apb to require certain non monetary exchange transactions to be recorded on a carry over cost basis if future cash flows are not expected to change significantly 
the statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payments 
this statement requires the expensing of stock options in the financial statements for periods no later than the annual or interim periods beginning after june  the company has determined at this time to implement the statement during the interim period ending september   but as of yet the company has not made a determination of the valuation methodology and  therefore  has not determined the impact to future periods 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on our operations during the past several years 
we believe we have historically been able to pass on increased costs through menu price increases  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future 
future increases in restaurant labor costs  including expected future increases in federal minimum wages  land and construction costs could adversely affect our profitability and ability to expand 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks including risks related to potential adverse changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we actively monitor exposure to market risk and continue to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in commodity prices 
interest rate risk total debt at december  included million of floating rate debt attributed to borrowings at an average interest rate of 
as a result  our annual interest cost in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
in connection with the senior notes due  the company entered into an interest swap agreement with the objective of managing our exposure to interest rate risk and lowering interest expense 
the agreement was effective beginning december and matures in ten years for an aggregate notional amount of million 
the impact on annual cash flow of a ten percent change in the floating rate approximately would be approximately million annually based on the floating rate debt and other obligations outstanding at december   however  there are no assurances that possible rate changes would be limited to such amounts
