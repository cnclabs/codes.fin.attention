item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary company overview milacron is a leading global provider of equipment  supplies  services and complete end to end solutions to the plastics processing industries 
we are also a leading global supplier of premium industrial fluids to the metalworking industries 
first incorporated in and headquartered in cincinnati  ohio  we employ about  people and operate major manufacturing facilities in north america  europe and asia  while maintaining sales and services offices in over one hundred countries around the world 
milacron s top priority is to support our customers with the most advanced technology and the most comprehensive  reliable service in our industry 
we operate in four business segments 
the first three  machinery technologies north america  machinery technologies europe and mold technologies  serve the plastics processing industries 
our fourth segment  industrial fluids  serves the metalworking sector 
both of our machinery technologies segments provide leading edge capital equipment  related tooling and replacement parts for the three most common methods of processing plastics injection molding  blow molding and extrusion 
our mold technologies segment supplies mold bases  mold components  hot runner systems and numerous other components for injection molding  as well as mro maintenance  repair and operating supplies for all plastics processing operations 
our industrial fluids segment develops and sells premium fluids for metalworking applications such as machining  grinding  forming and process cleaning 
in all our businesses  we focus on leading edge technology with superior aftermarket service and support 
we entered the plastics machinery business with the introduction of our first line of injection molding machines in the late s 
by the mid s  we had become the number one us producer of plastics machinery 
our major customers are producers of packaging  automobiles  consumer goods  building materials  industrial components  medical devices  appliances and housewares  and electrical products 

table of contents milacron pioneered the development of synthetic water based industrial fluids and we have sold these fluids since the late s 
our largest customer for fluids is the automotive industry  followed by makers of industrial components and machinery  off road equipment  appliances and housewares  and aircraft 
plastics markets background and recent history since the end of world war ii  plastics and plastic composites have increasingly replaced traditional materials such as metal  wood  glass and paper throughout manufacturing 
since  global consumption of plastics resins has grown at a compounded annual rate of  compared to for steel and for aluminum sources basf ag  association of plastics manufacturers in europe  international iron steel institute  us geological survey 
plastic part production  like industrial production in general  has historically shown sustained growth 
in every year from to  plastic part production in the us increased over the prior year  averaging compounded annual growth source us federal reserve board 
growth in plastics consumption and production has generally created increasing demand for our plastics machinery and related supplies 
between and  our sales of plastics equipment and supplies in north america grew at compounded annually excluding acquisitions including acquisitions 
in the s  milacron  like many other us companies  benefited from a strong  growing economy 
our plastics technologies sales were approaching billion with good profitability 
at the end of the decade  however  the us manufacturing sector fell into its most severe and prolonged downturn since the s 
from june to june  for example  us industrial production  a key indicator of demand for our products  declined source us federal reserve board 
the plastics processing portion of the manufacturing sector was severely impacted 
as production slowed  capacity utilization rates of us plastics processors dropped from the previous peaks near to record lows around source us federal reserve board  and shipments of injection molding machines in north america fell from a billion month moving total in to under million by the end of  and it stayed at very low levels through but experienced a partial recovery in source the society of plastics industry 
during this deep recession in north america  with both european and asian markets also in decline  albeit more modestly  demand for many of our plastics machinery lines declined by or more  and our total global plastics technologies sales fell 
despite a series of responsive actions  including a number of plant closings  head count reductions and other measures resulting in cumulative annual cost savings of million  severely depressed sales volumes led to consolidated losses from continuing operations in through at the end of  the manufacturing sector of the north american economy began to show some signs of recovery 
in early  the institute for supply management s manufacturing index  traditionally a very accurate leading indicator  rose to its highest level in twenty years  portending the long awaited rebound in manufacturing 
in the plastics sector  part production and us capacity utilization were increasing gradually 
in mid  however  the industry was hit by a steep  unexpected jump in oil prices  resulting in rapid rises in material and resin costs 
many of our plastics processing customers were negatively impacted  and we saw a corresponding weakness in plastics machinery orders in the second half of the year 
by the end of  however  there were signs that the recovery had resumed  including a double digit increase in orders for plastics injection molding machinery in north america 
industrial fluids recent history during the severe manufacturing recession of  overall demand for our metalworking fluids declined by only  as our largest customer group  automakers  maintained high levels of production both in north america and worldwide 
profitability in the fluids business  although impacted  held up fairly well throughout this period  with operating earnings in the range of to of sales 
in  sales of our metalworking fluids were up from the prior year  aided in part by our geographic expansion in the growing eastern european and asian markets  as well as by favorable currency translation 
table of contents effects 
however  profitability in this segment declined due to a significant increase in insurance expense  as well as higher material costs and pension expense 
consolidated results sales and new orders in were up slightly compared to  as good growth in north america and asia and favorable currency translation effects were tempered by weakness in western europe 
our net loss for the year was million  and included million in refinancing costs and million in restructuring charges 
earnings from continuing operations before interest  taxes  restructuring  refinancing and goodwill impairment charges were two and one half times higher than in  as savings from restructuring and other cost reduction measures more than compensated for increased costs of materials  pension  insurance and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
opportunities and challenges milacron successfully overcame a number of difficult challenges in in the first half of the year  even though an economic recovery in the manufacturing sector was gradually taking hold in north america  uncertainty surrounding the refinancing of major debt obligations maturing at that time had a discernible negative impact on our orders 
by mid year  we had completed all the key refinancing transactions needed to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our financial flexibility and we were well positioned to begin taking advantage of the recovery 
unfortunately  at that time sudden increases in oil and material prices stalled the recovery and had a dampening effect on capital spending by our customers 
to help reduce the impact of rising material costs and improve the availability of various steel components  we have been increasing our sourcing of parts and subassemblies from non traditional markets 
in addition  we have been able to offset some higher material costs with aggressive cost reductions and selective price increases  depending on market conditions 
this should have a favorable impact on margins going forward 
in we continued to expand our presence outside the united states  canada and western europe 
during the year  we launched a joint venture operation in china  stepped up production in india and expanded our customer service capabilities in asia and eastern europe 
as a result  we achieved sales growth in excess of in these non traditional markets 
in addition  we undertook a number of initiatives to strengthen our performance and customer focus in our home markets of north america and western europe 
as we enter  the recovery in machinery orders is once again taking hold and we are encouraged by recent order trends  particularly in north america 
beyond new machinery sales  our customers also want their existing tooling and equipment to last longer  and this creates major opportunities for us in all of our businesses  particularly aftermarket sales and service 
a critical part of our strategy going forward  therefore  is to broaden our capabilities to provide strong aftermarket support 
among the challenges facing us in are increased pension and insurance expense  higher material costs and ongoing weakness in western european markets 
we expect to overcome these challenges through continued aggressive cost reductions  selective price increases and further sales growth in north america  eastern europe and asia 
while our primary focus is on helping our customers become more competitive and profitable through advanced technology and superior service  we will also continue to improve our own competitiveness and profitability through lean manufacturing techniques and other efficiency measures 
combined  all of these factors should help make a better year for milacron 
consolidated results presence outside the us since  milacron has significantly expanded its presence outside the us and become more globally balanced 
for  markets outside the us represented the following percentages of our consolidated sales europe  asia  canada and mexico  and the rest of the world 
as a result of this geographic mix  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the translation of our sales and earnings  as well as 
table of contents consolidated shareholders equity 
during  the weighted average exchange rate of the euro was stronger in relation to the us dollar than in as a result  milacron experienced favorable currency translation effects on new orders and sales of million and million  respectively 
the effect on earnings was not material 
during  the euro strengthened against the us dollar by approximately which caused the majority of a million favorable adjustment to consolidated shareholders equity 
if the euro should weaken against the dollar in future periods  we could experience a negative effect in translating our european new orders  sales and earnings when compared to historical results 
internal control over financial reporting while our management s and our independent auditor s assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are not complete  a material weakness  as defined in standards established by the public company accounting oversight board united states  has been identified 
the deficiency consists of inadequate levels of review of complex and judgmental accounting issues 
various adjustments to our financial statements were needed to correct errors resulting from the internal control deficiency 
the deficiency manifested itself in the determination of deferred tax valuation allowances as well as litigation reserves and recoverables from third party insurers 
this internal control deficiency does not affect our independent auditor s unqualified report on our financial statements as of december  and for the year then ended included in this annual report on form k 
to address this material weakness we have increased our levels of review of complex and judgmental accounting issues and have initiated a plan to add personnel with technical accounting expertise as well as made a commitment to increase professional development for finance and accounting personnel 
see item a of this form k for further discussion of our internal control over financial reporting 
significant accounting policies and judgments the consolidated financial statements discussed herein have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that are included therein 
the following is a summary of certain accounting policies  estimates and judgmental matters that we believe are significant to our reported financial position and results of operations 
additional accounting policies are described in the note captioned summary of significant accounting policies on pages through of this form k  which should be read in connection with the discussion that follows 
we regularly review our estimates and judgments and the assumptions regarding future events and economic conditions that serve as their basis 
while we believe that the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are reasonable in the circumstances  the recorded amounts could vary under different conditions or assumptions 
deferred tax assets and valuation allowances at december   we had significant deferred tax assets related to us and us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and related to charges that have been deducted for financial reporting purposes but which are not yet deductible for income tax reporting 
these charges include the write down of goodwill and a charge to equity related to minimum pension funding 
at december   we have provided valuation allowances against all net deferred tax assets except million in the us that are offset by qualified tax planning strategies and available carrybacks and million of non us assets to be realized through future income expectations and tax planning strategies 
valuation allowances serve to reduce the recorded deferred tax assets to amounts reasonably expected to be realized in the future 
the establishment of valuation allowances and their subsequent adjustment requires a significant amount of judgment because expectations as to the realization of deferred tax assets particularly those assets related to net operating loss carryforwards are generally contingent on the generation of taxable income  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities in the future and the availability of qualified tax planning strategies 
tax planning strategies represent prudent and feasible actions that management would take to create taxable income to keep a tax 
table of contents attribute from expiring during the carryforward period 
determinations of the amounts related to tax planning strategies assume hypothetical transactions  some of which involve the disposal of substantial business assets  and certain variables which are judgmental and subjective 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  we consider our short term and long range internal operating plans  which are based on the current economic conditions in the markets and countries in which we operate  and the effect of potential economic changes on our various operations 
at december   we had non us net operating loss carryforwards principally in the netherlands  germany and italy totaling million and related deferred tax assets of million 
valuation allowances totaling million had been provided with respect to these assets 
we believe that it is more likely than not that portions of the net operating loss carryforwards in these jurisdictions will be utilized 
however  there is currently insufficient positive evidence in some non us jurisdictions primarily germany and italy to conclude that no valuation allowances are required 
at december   we had a us federal net operating loss carryforward of million  of which million  million and million expire in  and  respectively 
deferred tax assets related to this loss carryforward  as well as to federal tax credit carryforwards million and additional state and local loss carryforwards million  totaled million 
additional deferred tax assets totaling approximately million had also been provided for book deductions not currently deductible for tax purposes  including the writedown of goodwill  postretirement health care benefit costs and accrued pension liabilities 
the deductions for financial reporting purposes are expected to be deducted for income tax purposes in future periods  at which time they will have the effect of decreasing taxable income or increasing the net operating loss carryforward 
the latter will have the effect of extending the ultimate expiration of the net operating loss carryforward beyond the transaction entered into with glencore finance ag and mizuho international plc on june  will substantially delay the timing of the utilization of certain of the us loss carryforwards and other tax attributes that are discussed in the preceding paragraph see liquidity and sources of capital 
this delay will increase tax expense and decrease available cash in future years 
although the amounts are dependent on a number of future events and are therefore not currently determinable  we are completing our analysis to determine the annual limitations applicable to the us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
at december   no valuation allowances had been provided with respect to the us deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not assessment of whether they would be realized 
this decision was based on the availability of qualified tax planning strategies and the expectation of increased industrial production and capital spending in the us plastics industry 
higher sales and order levels in and beyond  combined with the significant reductions in our cost structure that had been achieved in recent years  were expected to result in improved operating results in relation to the losses incurred in and at june   however  we concluded that a recovery in the plastics industry and our return to profitability in the us would be delayed longer than originally expected 
as a result of these delays and the incremental costs of the restructuring initiatives announced in the third quarter of  we expected to incur a cumulative operating loss in the us for the three year period ending december  in such situations  us generally accepted accounting principles include a presumption that expectations of earnings in the future cannot be considered in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
accordingly  a charge to the tax provision of approximately million was recorded in the second quarter of to establish valuation allowances with respect to a portion of our us deferred tax assets for which future income was previously assumed 
during the second half of  we increased us deferred tax assets by approximately million due to continued losses from operations and a goodwill impairment charge  the effects of which were partially offset by taxable income related to dividends from non us subsidiaries 
valuation allowances were also increased by million and as a result  there was no tax benefit for financial reporting purposes associated with the losses and the impairment charge 
during  deferred tax assets and valuation allowances were further increased by million and million  respectively 
as of december   us deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities totaled million and us valuation allowances totaled million 

table of contents we continue to rely on the availability of qualified tax planning strategies to conclude that valuation allowances are not required with respect to a portion of our us deferred tax assets 
at december   valuation allowances had not been recorded with respect to million of us deferred tax assets based on qualified tax planning strategies of million and tax carrybacks of million 
due to better market information and refined estimates  the million of tax planning strategies at the end of represents a net million increase over the tax planning strategies at december  which resulted in a million non cash credit to the provision for income taxes in we will reassess our conclusions regarding qualified tax planning strategies and their effect on the amount of valuation allowances that are required on a quarterly basis 
this could result in a further increase or decrease in income tax expense and a corresponding decrease or increase in shareholders equity in the period of the change 
accounts receivable  inventory and warranty reserves our internal accounting policies require that each of our operations maintain appropriate reserves for uncollectible receivables  inventory obsolescence and warranty costs in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
because of the diversity of our customers and product lines  the specific procedures used to calculate these reserves vary by location but in all cases must conform to company guidelines 
reserves are required to be reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a quarterly basis 
allowances for doubtful accounts are generally established using specific percentages of the gross receivable amounts based on their age as of a particular balance sheet date 
because of the product line and customer diversity noted above  each business unit is required to base the percentages it applies to its aged receivables on its unique history of collection problems 
the percentages used are reviewed for continued reasonableness on a quarterly basis 
the amounts calculated through this process are then adjusted for known credit risks and collection problems 
write offs of accounts receivable for our continuing operations have averaged million during the last three years 
while we believe that our reserves for doubtful accounts are reasonable in the circumstances  adverse changes in general economic conditions or in the financial condition of our major customers could result in the need for additional reserves in the future 
reserves for inventory obsolescence are generally calculated by applying specific percentages to inventory carrying values based on the level of usage and sales in recent years 
as is the case for allowances for doubtful accounts  each business unit selects the percentages it applies based on its i unique history of inventory usage and obsolescence problems and ii forecasted usage 
the preliminary calculations are then adjusted based on current economic trends  expected product line changes  changes in customer requirements and other factors 
in  our continuing operations recorded new inventory obsolescence reserves totaling million and utilized million of such reserves in connection with the disposal of obsolete inventory 
we believe that our reserves are appropriate in light of our historical results and our assumptions regarding the future 
however  adverse economic changes or changes in customer requirements could necessitate the recording of additional reserves through charges to earnings in the future 
our warranty reserves are of two types normal and extraordinary 
normal warranty reserves are intended to cover routine costs associated with the repair or replacement of products sold in the ordinary course of business during the warranty period 
these reserves are accrued using a percentage of sales approach based on the ratio of actual warranty costs over a representative number of years to sales revenues from products sold with warranties over the same period 
the percentages are required to be reviewed and adjusted as necessary at least annually 
extraordinary warranty reserves are intended to cover major problems related to a single machine or customer order or to problems related to a large number of machines or other type of product 
these reserves are intended to cover the estimated costs of resolving the problems based on all relevant facts and circumstances 
in recent years  costs related to extraordinary warranty problems have not been significant 
in  our continuing operations accrued warranty reserves totaling million and incurred warranty related costs totaling million 
while we believe that our warranty reserves are adequate in the circumstances  unforeseen problems related to unexpired warranty obligations could result in a requirement for additional reserves in the future 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and long lived assets in years prior to  we reviewed the carrying value of goodwill annually using estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
however  effective january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 under which we test goodwill for impairment using probability weighted cash flows discounted at market interest rates 
the change from undiscounted to discounted cash flows resulted in a pretax goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax that was recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting method as of january  sfas no 
requires that the first phase of testing goodwill for impairment be based on a business unit s fair value  which is generally best determined through market prices 
due to the absence of market prices for our businesses and as permitted by sfas no 
 we have elected to base our testing on discounted cash flows as discussed above 
although the discount rates and other input variables may differ  the model we use in this process is the same model we use to evaluate the fair value of acquisition candidates and the fairness of offers to purchase businesses that we are considering for divestiture 
the cash flows we use are derived from the annual long range planning process that we complete in the third quarter of each year 
in this process  each business unit is required to develop reasonable sales  earnings and cash flow forecasts for the next three years based on current and forecasted economic conditions 
each business unit s plan is reviewed by corporate management and the entire plan is reviewed with our board of directors 
for purposes of testing for impairment  the cash flow forecasts are adjusted as needed to reflect information that becomes available concerning changes in business levels and general economic trends 
the discount rates are obtained from an outside source based on the standard industrial classification codes in which our businesses operate 
these discount rates are then judgmentally adjusted for plan risk the risk that a business will fail to achieve its forecasted results and country risk the risk that economic or political instability in the non us countries in which we operate will cause a business unit s projections to be inaccurate 
finally  a growth factor beyond the three year period for which cash flows are planned is selected based on expectations of future economic conditions 
virtually all of the assumptions used are susceptible to change due to global and regional economic conditions as well as competitive factors in the industries in which we operate 
in recent years  many of our cash flow forecasts have not been achieved due in large part to the unprecedented length and depth of the recession  particularly in the market for capital equipment in the plastics processing industry 
unanticipated changes in discount rates from one year to the next can also have a significant effect on the results of the calculations 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions we use are reasonable in the circumstances  various economic factors could cause the results of our testing to vary significantly 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or whenever certain indicators of impairment are determined to be present 
we conducted our first annual review of goodwill balances as of october  this review resulted in a pretax goodwill impairment charge related to the mold technologies segment of million with no tax benefit that was recorded in the fourth quarter 
in the third quarter of  we tested the goodwill of the mold base and components and maintenance  repair and operating supplies mro businesses that are included in the mold technologies segment for impairment due to the presence of certain indicators of impairment 
although these businesses failed to achieve the cash flow forecasts included in their annual business plans during the first half of the year  at the end of the second quarter of it was believed that a further economic recovery in both north america and europe would result in improved cash flows for these businesses for the remainder of the year and for subsequent years 
it was also anticipated that the restructuring actions undertaken in europe in the years through would significantly improve the overall cash flow of the mold base and components business 
during the third quarter of  we completed our annual long range planning process that focused on the years through this process revealed that the future cash flows expected to be generated by the two businesses would continue to be lower than the amounts anticipated a year earlier 
the biggest decrease in expected cash flow related to the european mold base and components business due to the anticipation of continued softness in the markets it serves 
because of the change in expectations  we tested the goodwill of both businesses for impairment during the third quarter of rather than waiting for the annual review that is conducted during the fourth quarter 
this review resulted in a preliminary goodwill impairment charge of million that was recorded in the third 
table of contents quarter and subsequently adjusted to million in the fourth quarter after the completion of the independent appraisals of certain tangible and intangible assets that were required to determine their fair values 
our annual review of goodwill as of october  did not result in any additional impairment charges 
our annual review of goodwill impairment as of october  did not result in additional impairment charges 
we review the carrying values of our long lived assets other than goodwill annually under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
these reviews are conducted by comparing the estimates of undiscounted future cash flows that are included in our long range internal operating plans to the carrying values of the related assets 
to be conservative  no growth in operating cash flows beyond the third year is currently assumed 
under this methodology  impairment would be deemed to exist if the carrying values exceeded the expected future cash flow amounts 
in  we reviewed the aggregate carrying values of selected groups of our long lived assets 
the assets included in these reviews consisted principally of property  plant and equipment and  where applicable  intangible assets other than goodwill 
based on these reviews  it was determined that the maximum period of time to recover the carrying values of the tested groups of assets through undiscounted cash flows is approximately years and that the weighted average recovery period is approximately of the remaining average lives of the assets 
based on the results of the reviews  no impairment charges were recorded in self insurance reserves through our wholly owned insurance subsidiary  milacron assurance ltd 
mal  we are primarily self insured for many types of risks  including general liability  product liability  environmental claims and worker s compensation for certain us employees 
mal  which is incorporated in bermuda and is subject to the insurance laws and regulations of that jurisdiction  establishes reserves commensurate with known or estimated exposures under the policies it issues to us 
exposure for general and product liability claims is supplemented by reinsurance coverage in some cases and by excess liability coverage in all policy years 
worker s compensation claims in excess of certain limits are insured with commercial carriers 
at december   mal had reserves for known claims and incurred but not reported claims under all coverages totaling approximately million and expected recoveries from excess carriers and other third parties of million 
expected recoveries represent the excess of total reserves for known exposures and incurred but not reported claims over the limits on the policies mal issues to us 
of the million in reserves at december   million is included in long term accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at that date 
the remaining million is included in accrued and other current liabilities 
the expected recoveries from excess carriers and other third parties are included in other current assets million and other noncurrent assets million 
mal s reserves are established based on known claims  including those arising from litigation  and our best estimates of the ultimate liabilities thereunder after consideration of excess carriers liabilities and claims against third parties and on estimates of the cost of incurred but not reported claims 
for certain types of exposures  mal and the company utilize actuarially calculated estimates prepared by outside consultants to ensure the adequacy of the reserves 
reserves are reviewed and adjusted at least quarterly based on all evidence available as of the respective balance sheet dates or as further information becomes available or circumstances change 
while the ultimate amount of mal s exposure to claims is dependent on future events that cannot be predicted with certainty  we believe that the recorded reserves are appropriate based on current information 
it is possible that our ultimate liability could substantially exceed our recorded reserves as of december   but the amount of any such excess cannot be reasonably determined at this time 
were we to have significant adverse judgments or determine  as cases progress  that significant additional reserves should be recorded  our future operating results  financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected 

table of contents pensions we maintain defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans that provide retirement benefits to substantially all us employees and certain non us employees 
the most significant of these plans is the principal defined benefit plan for certain us employees  which is also the only defined benefit plan that is funded 
excluding charges of million for temporary supplemental retirement benefits that were offered in connection with restructuring actions  we recorded pension income of million related to this plan in in  however  pension income decreased to 
million  once again excluding charges for supplemental benefits of million 
we recorded pension expense related to this plan of approximately million in and currently expect to record pension expense of million to million in pension expense for and beyond is dependent on a number of factors including returns on plan assets and changes in the plan s discount rate and therefore cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
the following paragraphs discuss the significant factors that affect the amount of recorded pension income or expense and the reasons for the reductions in income identified above 
a significant factor in determining the amount of income or expense to be recorded for the funded us plan is the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption 
in and in several preceding years  we used an expected long term rate of return of 
however  we began using a rate of return of beginning in and continued to do so in we develop the long term rate of return assumption based on the current mix of equity and debt securities included in the plan s assets and on the historical returns on those types of investments  judgmentally adjusted to reflect current expectations of future returns 
in evaluating future returns on equity securities  the existing portfolio is stratified to separately consider large and small capitalization investments  as well as international securities 
the change from the rate of return assumption to the lower rate had the effect of reducing the amount of pension income that would otherwise be reportable in by almost million 
in determining the amount of pension income or expense to be recognized  the expected long term rate of return is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a three year period 
this practice is intended to reduce year to year volatility in recorded pension income or expense but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on the long term rate of return assumption 
at december   the market value of the plan s assets was million whereas the calculated value of these assets was million 
the difference arises because the latter amount includes only two thirds of the asset related gain realized in and one third of the gain from however  if significant asset related losses are incurred in  it will have the effect of increasing the amount of pension expense to be recognized in future years beginning in in addition to the expected rate of return on plan assets  recorded pension income or expense includes the effects of service cost the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period and interest on the plan s liabilities to participants 
these amounts are determined actuarially based on current discount rates and assumptions regarding matters such as future salary increases and mortality 
differences in actual experience in relation to these assumptions are generally not recognized immediately but rather are deferred together with asset related gains or losses 
when cumulative asset related and liability related gains or losses exceed the greater of of total liabilities or the calculated value of plan assets  the excess is amortized and included in pension income or expense 
at december   the discount rate used to value the liabilities of the principal us plan was reduced from to 
the rate was further lowered to at december  and to at december  the combined effects of these changes and the variances in relation to the long term rate of return assumption discussed above have resulted in cumulative losses in excess of the corridor 
pension expense for includes more than million for the amortization of previously unrecognized losses 
expense for amortization of previously unrecognized losses is expected to be in excess of million in additional changes in the key assumptions discussed above would affect the amount of pension expense currently expected to be recorded for years subsequent to specifically  a one half percent increase in the rate of return on plan assets assumption would have the effect of decreasing pension expense by approximately million 
a comparable decrease in this assumption would have the opposite effect 
in addition  a one 
table of contents quarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease expense by approximately 
million 
conversely  a one quarter percent decrease in the discount rate would have the effect of increasing pension expense by million 
because of the significant decrease in the value of the assets of the funded plan for us employees during and and the decreases in the plan s discount rate  we recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment of million effective december  and significantly reduced the carrying value of the pension asset related to the plan 
this resulted in a million after tax reduction in shareholders equity 
at december   shareholders equity was increased by million with no tax effect due to an increase in plan assets in that was partially offset by an increase in liabilities that resulted from a lower discount rate 
during  the amount of the adjustment to shareholders equity was increased by million with no related tax effect to million 
the change was due to an increase in the assets of the funded plan that was more than offset by an increase in its liabilities due to the change in the discount rate and to the recording of a similar adjustment related to an unfunded plan 
all of these adjustments were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and therefore did not affect reported earnings or loss 
however  they resulted in million and million after tax reductions of shareholders equity at december  and december   respectively 
results of operations in an effort to help readers better understand the composition of our operating results  certain of the discussions that follow include references to restructuring costs 
accordingly  those discussions should be read in connection with i the tables on pages and of this form k under the caption comparative operating results and ii the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included herein on pages through basis of presentation as discussed more fully in the note to the consolidated financial statements captioned summary of significant accounting policies changes in methods of accounting  in the fourth quarter of  we elected to change our method of accounting for certain us plastics machinery inventories from the last in  first out lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method  retroactive to the beginning of the year 
certain of the amounts discussed herein for the years and have been restated to conform to the presentation 
earnings per common share as discussed more fully in the note to the consolidated financial statements captioned earnings per common share  the number of shares previously used to compute earnings loss per common share data for all years prior to has been increased by a factor of to reflect the effects of a bonus element inherent in a rights offering that was completed in the fourth quarter of discontinued operations as discussed more fully in the note to the consolidated financial statements captioned discontinued operations  in the third quarter of we completed the sales of our valenite and widia and werk metalcutting tools businesses and began to explore strategic alternatives for the sale of our round metalcutting tools and grinding wheels businesses 
the round metalcutting tools business was sold in two separate transactions in the third quarter of and the grinding wheels business was sold on april  all of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
the comparisons of results of operations that follow exclude these businesses and relate solely to our continuing operations unless otherwise indicated 

table of contents pension income and expense in and prior years  we recorded significant amounts of income related to our defined benefit pension plan for certain us employees 
however  because of the significant decrease in the value of the plan s assets and changes in the rate of return on assets and discount rate assumptions see significant accounting policies and judgments pensions  pension income in was reduced to 
million  of which 
million is included in continuing operations 
for  we recorded pension expense of million  substantially all of which was charged to continuing operations 
as discussed further below  the fluctuations between years have negatively affected margins  selling and administrative expense and earnings 
additional increases in non cash pension expense are expected in because of the funded status of the plan  we will be required to make cash contributions to the plan s trust for the next several years in addition to the million that was contributed in estimated amounts applicable to future years are included in the table captioned contractual obligations and discussed in note a thereto see contractual obligations 
compared to new order and sales consolidated new orders were million in compared to million in consolidated sales totaled million in  which represents a million  or  increase over sales of million 
new orders and sales benefited from million and million  respectively  of favorable currency effects that resulted principally from the strength of the euro in relation to the us dollar 
export orders increased from million in to million in and export sales increased from million to million 
the increases were due principally to higher export business for us built injection molding machines that was offset to some degree by lower volume for blow molding systems 
total sales to non us markets  including exports  were million in compared to million in with the increase being due principally to currency effects

incremental cost savings from the restructuring actions that are discussed below were approximately million in we expect to realize an additional million of savings in when we receive the full benefit of actions initiated in approximately two thirds of savings in both years relate to cost of products sold 
while precise quantification is impossible  we believe that our results for also benefited from the process improvements initiated in recent years 
total selling and administrative expense decreased modestly from million in to million in despite adverse currency effects and a million increase in pension expense 
selling expense decreased by million due in part to the benefits of our restructuring actions 
lower bad debt expense and trade show costs also contributed to the decrease

no further refinancing expenses are expected in restructuring costs the following paragraphs discuss the restructuring actions undertaken in recent years 
these actions are discussed more fully in the note to the consolidated financial statements captioned restructuring costs which should be read in connection with the discussion that follows 
in november  we announced restructuring initiatives intended to improve operating efficiency and customer service 
one of these actions involved the transfer of all manufacturing of container blow molding machines and structural foam systems from the plant in manchester  michigan to our more modern and efficient facility near cincinnati  ohio 
in addition  the mold making operation has been moved to a smaller  more cost effective location near manchester 
in another action  the manufacture of special mold bases for injection molding at the monterey park  california plant was discontinued and transferred to other facilities in north america 
early in  we initiated a plan for the further restructuring of our european blow molding machinery operations  including the discontinuation of the manufacture of certain product lines at the magenta  italy plant 
we also initiated a plan to close our special mold base machining operation in mahlberg  germany and relocate a portion of its manufacturing to another location 
certain other production was outsourced 
in the third quarter of  we began to implement additional restructuring initiatives that focused on further overhead cost reductions in each of our plastics technologies segments and at the corporate office 
these actions involved the relocation of production  closure of sales offices  voluntary early retirement programs and general overhead reductions 

table of contents in the second quarter of  we initiated additional actions to further enhance customer service while reducing the total overhead cost structure of our north american plastics machinery operations 
in the third quarter of  we elected to discontinue the sale of certain lines of blow molding systems in north america 
this decision resulted in a charge of million to adjust the carrying values of the related inventory to net realizable value 
finally  in response to soft market conditions in western europe  we implemented further headcount reductions in our mold technologies business in that region during the fourth quarter 
in addition to the actions that are discussed above  restructuring costs in both and include costs to integrate the operations of two businesses acquired in with our existing mold base and components business in europe 
a majority of the costs relate to adjustments of the carrying values of two closed manufacturing facilities to reflect revised estimates of their ultimate selling prices 
in total  the actions described above resulted in restructuring costs of million in and million in the amount for includes fourth quarter non cash charges totaling million to adjust the carrying values of surplus machinery and three closed manufacturing facilities  including one located in the us  to expected realizable values 
cash costs related to the restructuring actions totaled million and million in and  respectively 
cash costs for certain other restructuring actions that were initiated in and were million in in  restructuring expense to complete the actions initiated in and will be approximately million while cash costs are expected to be approximately million 
the costs and related cash effects of the actions described above as well as certain other actions that were initiated in are summarized in the table that follows

the charge was calculated by discounting estimated future cash flows and resulted from a downward adjustment of the cash flows expected to be generated by these businesses due to the delay in the general economic recovery in both north america and europe

the relocation of the blow molding machinery business and supplemental early retirement benefits intended to reduce the segment s cost structure accounted for a majority of the expense 
the segment s improved operating results in were due principally to increased sales volume  improved price realization and incremental benefits of approximately million related to the restructuring and cost cutting initiatives that were implemented in through the incremental savings in are expected to be in excess of million 
machinery technologies europe the machinery technologies europe segment had new orders of million and sales of million in in  orders were million while sales totaled million 
currency effects contributed million of incremental orders and million of sales in demand was primarily export driven as orders in western europe slowed  particularly in the fourth quarter of the year 
despite rising material costs  the segment had an operating profit of million in compared to a loss of million in these amounts exclude restructuring costs of 
million in and million in in both years  these costs related to the restructuring of the segment s blow molding machinery business including the discontinuation of certain product lines that was undertaken in and to overhead reductions in the segment s injection molding machinery business 
the incremental savings related to these actions totaled approximately million in approximately million of incremental savings are expected in mold technologies the mold technologies segment s new orders of million were virtually unchanged from the prior year despite favorable currency effects of million 
the segment s sales of million were also flat despite million of favorable currency effects 
orders and sales improved modestly in north america but decreased in europe due to weak economic conditions in that region 
despite higher insurance costs in north america and raw material cost increases worldwide  the segment had an operating profit of million in compared to a profit of million in  in both cases excluding restructuring costs 
the improvement in profitability was primarily the result of cost savings from recent restructuring actions in europe 
weak price realization and reduced sales volume in europe tempered the extent of the improvement 
the segment s restructuring costs totaled million in and million in the costs related principally to overhead reductions in north america and the further consolidation of the segment s european operations  including the closure of a manufacturing plant and the reorganization of its marketing and sales structure 
the amount for was due to adjustments to the carrying values of two closed facilities to reflect revised estimates of their future selling prices  costs to downsize another facility and additional overhead reductions implemented in the fourth quarter 
cost savings related to the and actions and to actions implemented in totaled approximately million 
the incremental savings related to the actions and the overhead reductions implemented in are expected to total approximately million in industrial fluids the industrial fluids segment had new orders and sales of million each in compared to orders and sales of million in favorable currency effects accounted for a majority of the increases as manufacturing activity slowed in the second half of the year 
the segment s operating profit decreased from million in to million in due principally to higher insurance costs  which increased by million  and higher raw material costs  especially for chemicals and steel 
transportation costs also increased in the segment s pension expense increased by 
million as did selling expense to expand distribution networks in both north america and eastern europe 
pension expense can be expected to increase further in but future insurance costs will depend on factors that cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
to offset the higher material costs  price increases were phased in during the fourth quarter of but because a high percentage of fluid sales are made on a six or twelve month contract basis  the full effect of the increases will not be realized until the first half of loss from continuing operations before income taxes our pretax loss from continuing operations was million in compared to a loss of million in the amount for includes refinancing costs of million and restructuring costs of million

income taxes in the second quarter of  we recorded a million charge in the provision for income taxes to establish valuation allowances against a portion of our us deferred tax assets see significant accounting policies and judgments deferred tax assets and valuation allowances 
additional deferred tax assets and valuation allowances were recorded in the second half of and in in  we recorded a net us tax benefit of million primarily related to a million increase in the value of our tax planning strategies and benefits relating to a special ten year carryback of million 
however  due to insufficient positive evidence we were precluded from recognizing a tax benefit related to the remaining operating loss incurred for the year 
certain of our non us subsidiaries also lacked sufficient positive evidence to allow them to record any tax benefits with respect to their losses for the year 
however  profitable non us operations  primarily in the netherlands  canada and india  recorded net income tax expense of million in additional valuation allowances of million were recorded against deferred tax asset balances in italy  france and denmark 
in the aggregate  these factors resulted in a tax benefit of million on a pretax loss from continuing operations of million

in the aggregate  these actions ultimately resulted in the elimination of approximately positions worldwide 
cost savings related to these actions were in excess of million in this is in addition to the savings we realized from the restructuring actions that were initiated in 
table of contents in the fourth quarter of  we initiated the transfer of all manufacture of container blow molding machines and structural foam systems from the plant in manchester  michigan to our facility near cincinnati  ohio 
the mold making operation in manchester was moved to a smaller  more cost effective location near the former facility 
in another action  the manufacture of special mold bases for injection molding at the monterey park  california plant was discontinued and transferred to other facilities in north america 
early in  we initiated a plan for the further restructuring of our european blow molding machinery operations  including the discontinuation of the manufacture of certain product lines at the magenta  italy plant 
in the second quarter of  we initiated a plan to close the special mold base machining operation in mahlberg  germany and relocate a portion of its manufacturing to another facility 
certain other production is being outsourced 
in the third quarter of  we began to implement additional restructuring initiatives that focus on further overhead cost reductions in each of our plastics technologies segments and at the corporate office 
these actions involve the relocation of production  closure of sales offices  voluntary early retirement programs and general overhead reductions 
in and  restructuring costs also include amounts for the integration of eoc and reform  two businesses acquired in  with our existing mold base and components business in europe and costs associated with initiatives announced in and to consolidate manufacturing operations and reduce milacron s cost structure

in addition  the segment s results were penalized by weaker price realization and reduced pension income but benefited from our restructuring and cost reduction initiatives 
excluding restructuring costs  the segment had operating earnings of million in compared to million in the decrease was due entirely to a million reduction in pension income and the absence of million of royalty income from the licensing of patented technology that was received in restructuring costs for the segment were million in and million in in both years  most of these costs related to the relocation of the north american blow molding systems business and to supplemental retirement benefits offered for the purpose of reducing the cost structure of the segment s injection molding and extrusion machinery businesses 
the restructuring actions initiated in and resulted in incremental cost savings in excess of million in machinery technologies europe the machinery technologies europe segment had new orders of million and sales of million in compared to orders of million and sales of million in currency translation effects related to the strength of the euro in relation to the dollar contributed about

additional deferred tax assets and valuation allowances were recorded in the second half of the year 
due to the geographic mix of earnings and losses  the tax provision for also includes income tax expense related to profitable operations in non us jurisdictions 
these factors resulted in a provision for income taxes of million despite a pretax loss of million

we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
at december   we had no outstanding forward contracts 
forward contracts totaled million at december  the annual potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency rates on our foreign exchange contracts at december  would not have materially affected our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk at december   we had fixed rate debt of million  including million face value of senior secured notes due that were issued on may   and floating rate debt of million 
at december   fixed rate debt totaled million and included the notes due that were repaid on march  and the eurobonds due  substantially all of which were repurchased on june  pursuant to a tender offer therefor 
floating rate debt totaled million at december  during and through march   we also had the ability to sell accounts receivable under our accounts receivable purchase agreement which resulted in financing fees that fluctuated based on changes in commercial paper rates 
as a result of these factors  a portion of annual interest expense and financing fees fluctuate based on changes in short term borrowing rates 
however  before consideration of any adverse effect of the interest rate swap that is discussed in the following paragraph  the potential annual loss on floating rate debt from a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not be significant at either of the aforementioned dates 
on july   we entered into a million notional amount interest rate swap that effectively converts a portion of fixed rate interest debt into a floating rate obligation 
the swap  which matures on november   is intended to achieve a better balance between fixed rate and floating rate debt 
the interest rate swap had the effect of lowering interest expense in by 
million 
at december   the potential annual increase in interest expense from a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have been approximately 
million 
however  increases in short term interest rates will have the effect of increasing interest expense in the first quarter of in addition  the fair value of the swap can change dramatically based on a number of variables  including a significant change in the shape of the yield curve and the passage of time 
changes in the fair value of the swap are reported as non cash increases or decreases in interest expense 
off balance sheet arrangements sales of accounts receivable as discussed more fully in the note to the consolidated financial statements captioned receivables  during several preceding years and through march   we maintained a receivables purchase agreement with a third party financial institution 
under this arrangement we sold  on a revolving basis  an undivided percentage ownership interest in designated pools of accounts receivable 
as existing receivables were 
table of contents collected  undivided interests in new eligible receivables were sold 
accounts that became days past due were no longer eligible to be sold and we were at risk for any related credit issues 
credit losses were not significant and we maintained an allowance for doubtful accounts sufficient to cover our estimated exposures 
on march  this facility was repaid see liquidity and sources of capital 
certain of our non us subsidiaries sell accounts receivable on an ongoing basis for purposes of improving liquidity and cash flows 
some of these sales are made with recourse  in which case appropriate reserves for potential losses are provided

glencore finance ag and mizuho international plc converted the entire principal amount of the series a notes into million shares of common stock on april  the series a notes and series b notes initially bore a combination of cash and pay in kind interest at a total rate of per annum 
the rate was retroactively reset on june  to per annum from the date of issuance  payable in cash 
on march   we also reached a separate agreement with credit suisse first boston for a million senior secured credit facility having a term of approximately one year 
this senior secured credit facility consisted of a million revolving a facility and a million term loan b facility 
on march   we used extensions of credit under the revolving a facility and term loan b facility in an aggregate amount of million to repay and terminate our then existing revolving credit facility in addition to replacing or providing credit support for outstanding letters of credit and our then existing receivables purchase program 
all amounts borrowed under the credit suisse first boston facility were repaid on june   as described below

on june   we also satisfied the conditions to release to us from escrow the proceeds from the offering of million of senior secured notes due and entered into an agreement for a new million asset based revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank as administrative agent and collateral agent 
on june   we applied the proceeds from the issuance of the senior secured notes due  together with million in borrowings under our asset based facility and approximately million of cash on hand  to purchase  of the million aggregate outstanding principal amount of milacron capital holdings bv s guaranteed bonds due in april at the settlement of a tender offer therefor  terminate and repay million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving a facility of the credit suisse first boston facility  which included additional amounts borrowed subsequent to march  we also used million of availability under our asset based facility to replace or provide credit support for the outstanding letters of credit under the revolving a facility of the credit suisse first boston facility  repay the million term loan b facility of the credit suisse first boston facility  and pay transaction expenses 
the borrowings under the asset based facility entered into on june  are secured by a first priority security interest  subject to permitted liens  in  among other things  us and canadian accounts receivable  cash and cash equivalents  inventory and  in the us  certain related rights under contracts  licenses and other general intangibles  subject to certain exceptions 
our asset based facility is also secured by a second priority security interest on the assets that secure the senior secured notes due on a first priority basis 
the availability of loans under our asset based facility is limited to a borrowing base equal to specified percentages of eligible us and canadian accounts receivable and us inventory and is subject to other conditions to borrowing and limitations  including an excess availability reserve the minimum required availability of million and an additional million hedging reserve as a result of the interest rate swap that was entered into on july  based on the assets included in the borrowing base as of december  and without giving effect to reserves  outstanding borrowings and issuances of letters of credit in all cases  as discussed below  we had 
table of contents approximately million of borrowing availability  subject to the customary ability of the administrative agent for the lenders to reduce rates  impose or change collateral value limitations  establish reserves and declare certain collateral ineligible from time to time in its reasonable credit judgment  any of which could reduce our borrowing availability at any time 
the terms of our asset based facility impose a daily cash sweep on cash received in our us bank accounts from collections of our accounts receivable 
this daily cash sweep is automatically applied to pay down any outstanding borrowings under our asset based facility 
the terms of our asset based facility also provide for the administrative agent  at its option and at any time  to impose a daily cash sweep on cash received in our canadian bank accounts from collections of our accounts receivable 
since the cash we receive from collection of receivables is subject to the automatic sweep to repay the borrowings under our asset based facility on a daily basis  we rely on borrowings under our asset based facility as our primary source of cash for use in our north american operations 
if we have no additional availability or are unable to satisfy the borrowing conditions  our liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
our asset based facility contains customary conditions precedent to any borrowings  as well as customary covenants  including  but not limited to  maintenance of unused availability under the borrowing base based on reserves including the excess availability reserve and the hedging reserve established by the administrative agent 
as of december   after giving effect to then outstanding letters of credit and the million borrowed under the facility  our availability after deducting the million of reserves was approximately million 
on november   we reached an agreement with the lenders to waive various technical defaults concerning certain inactive subsidiaries 
in addition  our asset based facility originally contained  for the first five quarters  a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum level of cumulative consolidated ebitda as defined in the facility  to be tested quarterly 
the facility was amended on september  and february   to reduce these requirements as discussed more fully below 
the facility also contains a limit on capital expenditures to be complied with on a quarterly basis  beginning with the third quarter of thereafter  we will have to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio to be tested quarterly 
this test was originally to be required beginning in the fourth quarter of but on february   we reached an agreement with the lenders to delay it until the first quarter of our asset based facility requires us to maintain minimum levels of cumulative consolidated ebitda to be tested quarterly 
this test was originally required through september  but the february  amendment to the facility extended it through december  in response to a reassessment of projected earnings and ebitda for the third and fourth fiscal quarters of  our asset based facility was amended on september  to reduce the minimum cumulative consolidated ebitda requirement for the three consecutive calendar months ending september  from million to million and for the six consecutive calendar months ending december  from million to million 
we subsequently identified additional adjustments that resulted in reducing our fourth quarter ebitda to below the minimum level required by the revised covenant 
however  we reached an agreement with our lenders on march  to waive any noncompliance in our fourth quarter resulting from certain of these adjustments 
accordingly  after giving effect to the wavier  we were in compliance with the revised covenant as of december  the facility was also amended on february  to reduce the minimum cumulative consolidated ebitda requirements for as follows for the nine consecutive calendar months ended march  from million to million  for the twelve consecutive calendar months ended june  from million to million  and for the twelve consecutive calendar months ended september  from million to million 
this amendment also established a minimum cumulative consolidated ebitda requirement of million for the twelve consecutive calendar months ended december  and extended the limitation on capital expenditures originally required through september  to december  our ability to continue to meet the cumulative consolidated ebitda covenant will be contingent on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these include our need for a continued increase in capital spending in the plastics processing industry and the resulting increases in our sales revenues and operating margins  our need for no material decrease in price realization  our ability to absorb recent raw material price increases or pass such price increases through to customers  and our continued ability to realize 
table of contents the benefits of our cost reduction and process improvement initiatives 
if we are unable to meet or exceed the minimum cumulative consolidated ebitda requirements of our asset based facility  we will attempt to further renegotiate this covenant with our lenders to assure compliance 
however  we cannot control our lenders actions and  if the negotiations are not successful  we could be forced to seek alternative sources of liquidity 
this may include  but is not necessarily limited to  seeking alternative lenders  sales of assets or business units and the issuance of additional indebtedness or equity 
failure to meet or exceed the minimum cumulative consolidated ebitda requirements of our asset based facility would constitute an event of default under the facility  which would permit the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness owed thereunder if such indebtedness remained unpaid and terminate their commitments to lend 
the acceleration of indebtedness under the asset based facility would also create a cross default under our senior secured notes due if the principal amount of indebtedness accelerated  together with the principal amount of any other such indebtedness under which there was a payment default or the maturity had been so accelerated  aggregated million or more  and such cross default would permit the trustee under the indenture governing the senior secured notes due or the holders of at least in principal amount of the then outstanding notes to declare the notes to be due and payable immediately 
the acceleration of obligations under our outstanding indebtedness would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our continued viability depends on realizing anticipated cost savings and operating improvements on schedule and continued improvement in demand levels in and beyond  the latter of which is largely beyond our control 
unless we realize anticipated cost savings and operating improvements on schedule and volume and pricing levels improve significantly  we may need to fund interest payments on the senior secured notes in part with the proceeds of borrowings under our asset based facility 
however  our ability to borrow under our asset based facility is subject to borrowing base limitations  including the excess availability reserve and the hedging reserve  which may be adjusted from time to time by the administrative agent for the lenders at its discretion  and our satisfaction of certain conditions to borrowing  including  among other things  conditions related to the continued accuracy of our representations and warranties and the absence of any unmatured or matured defaults including under financial covenants or any material adverse change in our business or financial condition 
in particular  our continued ability to borrow under our asset based facility is contingent on our ability to comply with financial covenants  including meeting the minimum cumulative consolidated ebitda requirements and other conditions to borrowing as discussed above 
if we have no additional availability or are otherwise unable to borrow against the facility  our liquidity would be impaired and we would need to pursue the alternative sources of liquidity discussed above to service our debt and pay our expenses 
there is no assurance that we would be able to sell assets  refinance debt or raise equity on commercially acceptable terms or at all  which could cause us to default on our obligations under our indebtedness  as discussed above 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow or draw sufficient amounts under our asset based facility to satisfy our debt obligations and pay our other expenses could cause us to default on our obligations and would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
borrowings under our asset based facility bear interest  at our option  at either i the libo rate plus the applicable margin as defined below or ii an abr plus the applicable margin as defined below 
the applicable margin  with respect to eurodollar loans  is between per annum and per annum and  with respect to abr loans  is between 
per annum and per annum  determined based on a calculation of the trailing average availability levels under our asset based facility 
libo rate means the rate at which eurodollar deposits in the london interbank market are quoted 
we may elect eurodollar loan interest periods of one  two or three months 
abr means the higher of i the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent as its prime rate in effect at its principal office in new york city or ii the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 
our asset based facility provides that we will pay a monthly unused line fee equal to 
per annum on the average daily unused portion of our credit commitment  as well as customary loan servicing and letter of credit issuance fees 

table of contents our asset based facility provides that upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default under our asset based facility  upon demand by the agent  we will have to pay i in the case of revolving credit loans  a rate of interest per annum equal to the rate of interest otherwise in effect assuming the rate in effect is at the maximum applicable margin pursuant to the terms of our asset based facility plus and ii in the case of other amounts  a rate of interest per annum equal to the abr plus the maximum applicable margin plus 
as discussed more fully in item a of this form k  we do not expect to file an amendment hereto that includes management s report and our auditor s attestation on internal control over financial reporting by the may  deadline 
however  we have reached an agreement with the lenders to waive the provision of our asset based facility concerning the timely filing of our form k as it relates to this information provided  among other things  the amendment is filed no later than june  while we believe we will meet this deadline  failure to do so could result in us being declared in default 
at december   we had other lines of credit with various us and non us banks totaling approximately million  of which approximately million was available under certain circumstances 
our debt and credit are rated by standard poor s s p and moody s investors service moody s 
on june   s p announced that it had raised our corporate credit rating to b with a positive outlook 
s p s positive outlook was reaffirmed on august  on june   moody s reaffirmed our senior unsecured rating at caa and our senior implied rating to caa and raised the outlook to positive 
none of our debt instruments include rating triggers that would accelerate maturity or increase interest rates in the event of a ratings downgrade 
accordingly  any potential rating downgrades would have no significant short term effect  although they could potentially affect the types and cost of credit facilities and debt instruments available to us in the future 
we expect to generate positive cash flow from operating activities during  which will be partially offset by up to million for capital expenditures 
we believe that our current cash position  cash flow from operations and available credit lines  including our asset based revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements for cautionary statement we wish to caution readers about all of the forward looking statements in the management s discussion and analysis section and elsewhere 
these include all statements that speak about the future or are based on our interpretation of factors that might affect our businesses 
we believe the following important factors  among others  could affect our actual results in and beyond and cause them to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking statements our ability to comply with financial and other covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness  including our senior secured notes and asset based credit facility  our ability to remediate or otherwise mitigate the identified material weakness in internal control over financial reporting  or any additional material weakness or significant deficiencies that may be identified  global and regional economic conditions  consumer spending  capital spending levels and industrial production  particularly in segments related to the level of automotive production and spending in the plastics and construction industries  fluctuations in currency exchange rates of us and foreign countries  including countries in europe and asia where we have several principal manufacturing facilities and where many of our customers  competitors and suppliers are based  fluctuations in interest rates which affect the cost of borrowing
