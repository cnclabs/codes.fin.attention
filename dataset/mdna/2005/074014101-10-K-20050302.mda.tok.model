item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we own and operate radio stations the following markets atlanta  ga  boston  ma  philadelphia  pa  miami ft

myers naples  fl  greenville new bern jacksonville  nc  fayetteville  nc  and augusta  ga 
we refer to each group of radio stations that we own in each radio market as a market cluster 
net revenue 
our net revenue  from which we generate the majority of our cash  is primarily derived from the sale of advertising airtime to local and national advertisers 
net revenue is gross revenue less agency commissions 
local revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sales to advertisers in a radio station s local market either directly with the advertiser or through the advertiser s agency 
national revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sales to agencies purchasing advertising for multiple markets 
national sales are generally facilitated by our national representation firm  which serves as our agent in these transactions 
we generated of our net revenue from sales of local advertising airtime and of our net revenue from sales of national advertising airtime in compared to and in  respectively 
we generated the balance of our net revenue from promotional events  brokered programming and sales to broadcasting networks that purchase advertising airtime 

table of contents the advertising rates that we are able to charge and the number of advertisements that we can broadcast without jeopardizing listener levels generally determine our net revenue 
advertising rates are primarily based on the following factors a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  as measured principally by quarterly reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations  as well as other forms of media  in the market competing for the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  and the size of the market 
our net revenue is affected by general economic conditions  competition and our ability to improve operations at our market clusters 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are also common in the radio broadcasting industry and are primarily due to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year and highest in the fourth calendar quarter 
we use trade agreements to reduce cash paid for expenses by exchanging advertising airtime for goods or services in a manner designed to maximize cash flows 
the following summary table presents a comparison of our trade revenue and expenses for the years ended december   and year ended december  trade revenue trade expenses operating expenses 
our operating expenses consist primarily of programming  engineering  and promotional expenses  reported as cost of services  and selling  general and administrative expenses incurred at our radio stations  general and administrative expenses  including compensation  insurance and other expenses  incurred at our corporate offices  and depreciation and amortization 
we strive to control our operating expenses by centralizing certain functions at our corporate offices and consolidating certain functions in each of our market clusters 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate is approximately  which differs from the federal statutory rate of due to the effect of state income taxes and certain of our expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes 
recent developments in june  we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire wgqr fm and wbla am in the elizabethtown radio market in north carolina for approximately  at that time  we filed an application with the fcc requesting consent to the assignment of the licenses to us  which is pending 
by public notice dated october   the fcc directed that pending assignment applications be amended to demonstrate compliance with or request a waiver of new multiple ownership rules adopted by the fcc in june that had previously been stayed by the court of appeals for the third circuit 
on november   we filed an amendment to the application that requested a waiver of the new multiple ownership rules 
the application remains pending 
on june   our credit agreement was amended to permit us to repurchase up to million of our common stock and to pay dividends on our common stock in an amount up to an aggregate of million per year 
as a result of this amendment  our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million of our class a common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions from time to time over a period of one year from the date of the authorization  in compliance with the sec s rule b and subject to market 
table of contents conditions  applicable legal requirements and the terms of our credit agreement 
our plan to repurchase shares of our common stock does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended or reinstated at any time and from time to time 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our class a common stock under the plan 
this amendment to our credit facility also removed a contractual impediment to our ability to pay up to million of dividends annually on our common stock 
in connection with seeking the amendment to our credit facility  our board of directors has considered the possibility of paying a dividend on our common stock in the future  although  as of the date hereof  it has not declared any dividend on our common stock 
any decision by our board of directors to declare and pay a dividend on our common stock in the future  and the amount of any such dividend  will be based on such factors as our financial results  liquidity requirements and capital resources at the time of such declaration  the status of our stock repurchase plan  the terms of  and effect of any such dividend on  our credit facility and the board of director s assessment of other factors that could be material to us 
effective january   we reorganized our internal reporting process and the information provided to our chief operating decision maker to better facilitate his evaluation of the performance of our radio stations 
our chief operating decision maker now receives operating results and other information directly from our radio stations and no longer evaluates performance or allocates resources based on the operating segments reported during periods that ended prior to january  as a result of this reorganization  we now operate only one reportable segment  which includes all of our radio stations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
impairment of fcc broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
we are required to estimate the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses and reporting units 
to estimate the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses as of december   we obtained appraisals from an independent appraisal company 
the appraisal company estimated the fair values of our fm broadcast licenses using discounted future cash flows and the fair values of our am licenses using a market valuation approach 
the appraisal includes several assumptions and estimates including the determination of future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate 
if the appraisal company had made different assumptions or used different estimates  including those used to determine future cash flows and the discount rate  the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses could have been materially different 
we used internally generated estimates of future cash flows to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units as of december  these estimates required management judgment and if we had made different assumptions the fair value of our reporting units could have been materially different 
we did not record any impairment losses on our fcc broadcasting licenses or goodwill during impairment of property and equipment 
we are required to assess the recoverability of our property and equipment whenever an event has occurred that may result in an impairment loss 
if such an event occurs  we will compare estimates of related future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flow estimates are less than the carrying amount of the asset  we will reduce the carrying amount to the estimated fair value 
the determination of when an event has occurred and estimates of future cash flows and fair value all require management judgment 
the use of different assumptions or estimates may result in alternative assessments that could be materially different 
we did not identify any events that may have resulted in an impairment loss on our property and equipment during 
table of contents valuation of accounts receivable 
we continually evaluate our ability to collect our accounts receivable 
our ongoing evaluation includes review of specific accounts at our radio stations  the current financial condition of our customers  and our historical write off experience 
this ongoing evaluation requires management judgment and if we had made different assumptions about these factors  the allowance for doubtful accounts could have been materially different 
recent pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas revised  share based payment 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
sfas r replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r eliminates the alternative to use opinion s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in sfas as originally issued 
under opinion  issuing stock options to employees generally resulted in recognition of no compensation cost 
sfas r requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we have not completed our evaluation of the impact of the adoption of sfas r 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following summary table presents a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december  and with respect to certain of our key financial measures 
these changes illustrated in the table are discussed in greater detail below 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
year ended december  change net revenue cost of services selling  general and administrative expenses corporate general and administrative expenses interest expense net revenue 
the increase in net revenue was due to improved performance in eight of our ten market clusters and included a million increase at our las vegas market cluster  a million increase at our ft 
myers naples market cluster  and a million increase at our fayetteville market cluster 
net revenue also included an increase of million at our philadelphia market cluster despite a million decrease at wrdw fm  which changed formats during the fourth quarter of  and an increase of million at our miami ft 
lauderdale market cluster despite a million decrease at wqam am due to the absence of revenue from games for the professional sports teams that were played in but did not take place in in addition  political advertising which is included in the above net revenue amounts  contributed million in compared to approximately  in we anticipate that net revenue generated by political advertising will return to historical levels during cost of services 
the increase in cost of services was primarily due to an increase in programming and promotional expenses at eight of our ten market clusters 
the increase was partially offset by a million decrease at wqam am due to the absence of expenses related to games for the professional sports teams that were played in but did not take place in 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased commissions  incurred in connection with generating the increase in net revenue at our market clusters 
corporate general and administrative expenses 
the increase in corporate general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased costs  including compensation  associated with complying with regulations applicable to public companies 
interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to an aggregate reduction of million in the outstanding balance under our credit facility from january  to december  and a reduction in associated borrowing costs during that period 
loss on extinguishment of long term debt 
on february   we entered into a new credit agreement 
the new credit facility consists of a revolving credit loan with a maximum commitment of million and a term loan of million 
proceeds from the new credit facility were used to repay the old credit facility 
in connection with the new credit agreement  we recorded a million loss on extinguishment of long term debt in the year ended december  to write off debt issuance costs related to the old credit facility and certain fees related to the new credit facility 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following summary table presents a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december  and with respect to certain of our key financial measures 
these changes illustrated in the table are discussed in greater detail below 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
year ended december  change net revenue cost of services selling  general and administrative expenses corporate general and administrative expenses interest expense net revenue 
the decrease in net revenue was partially due to a million decrease in net revenue from our philadelphia market cluster primarily due to a non traditional revenue event not held in that contributed million to net revenue in  and a decrease in national advertising revenue 
the decrease was also partially due to a million decrease in net revenue from our fayetteville market cluster  which is located near several military bases 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in net revenue from our ft 
myers naples market cluster  a million increase in net revenue from our miami ft 
lauderdale market cluster  and a million increase in net revenue from our las vegas market cluster due in each case to improved performance in these clusters 
cost of services 
the increase in cost of services was primarily due to a million increase in costs at our miami ft 
lauderdale market cluster primarily due to a million increase in program rights fees associated with the florida marlins baseball club and an increase in that market cluster in other programming and promotional expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a million decrease in expenses at our miami ft 
lauderdale market cluster primarily due to cost containment measures 

table of contents corporate general and administrative expenses 
the increase in corporate general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased compensation and insurance premiums 
interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a general decline in interest rates and a reduction of the outstanding balance under our credit facility as described in net cash used in financing activities in the liquidity and capital resources section in this item 
loss on extinguishment of long term debt 
on september   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement  under which a new million term loan b was issued and certain financial covenants were revised 
the proceeds from term loan b were used to reduce the outstanding balance and maximum commitment of our revolving credit loan and the outstanding balance of term loan a 
in connection with the amended and restated credit agreement  we recorded a million loss on extinguishment of long term debt for the year ended december  gain on investments 
the million gain on sale of investments in was the result of the sale of an aggregate of  shares of common stock of findwhat 
com during the year ended december  compared to a million gain as a result of the sale of an aggregate of  shares of common stock of findwhat 
com during the year ended december  gain on increase in fair value of derivative financial instruments 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  our interest rate cap  collar and swap agreements are carried at fair value 
the estimated fair value of each agreement is based on the amounts we would expect to receive or pay to terminate the agreement 
the gain on increase in fair value of derivative financial instruments of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  reflects the decrease in the amounts we would expect to pay to terminate our interest rate cap  collar and swap agreements not designated as hedges in accordance with sfas cumulative effect of accounting change 
as a result the adoption of sfas effective january   we recognized an impairment loss of million related to fcc broadcasting licenses and goodwill  of which million  net of income taxes  was reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change and million  net of income taxes  was reported in discontinued operations for the year ended december  discontinued operations 
on october   we entered into a definitive agreement with abc  inc to sell wbyu am in the new orleans market for million  subject to certain adjustments 
as of the completion of this sale on february   we no longer had operations in new orleans therefore the results of operations for wbyu am have been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
net income from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december   which included a gain on disposal of million  net of income taxes  compared to a net loss from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december   which included the million impairment loss  net of income taxes  due to the adoption of sfas liquidity and capital resources overview 
our primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow and our credit facility 
our liquidity needs have been  and for the next twelve months and thereafter are expected to continue to be  for working capital  debt service  radio station acquisitions  additional share repurchases  and other general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
we expect to provide for future liquidity needs through one or a combination of the following sources of liquidity available to us internally generated cash flow  our credit facility  
table of contents additional borrowings  other than under our existing credit facility  to the extent permitted thereunder  and additional equity offerings 
we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to permit us to provide for our liquidity requirements and meet our financial obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  poor financial results  unanticipated acquisition opportunities or unanticipated expenses could give rise to additional debt servicing requirements or other additional financing or liquidity requirements sooner than we expect and  we may not secure financing when needed or on acceptable terms 
as of december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents and had million in remaining commitments available under our credit facility  however  as of december   our maximum total leverage covenant would have limited additional borrowings to million 
our ability to reduce our total leverage ratio by increasing operating cash flow and or decreasing long term debt will determine how much  if any  of the remaining commitments under our credit facility will be available to us in the future 
poor financial results or unanticipated expenses could result in our failure to maintain or lower our total leverage ratio and we may not be permitted to make any additional borrowings under our credit facility 
additionally  to the extent that we determine to make additional share repurchases or make future dividend payments instead of repaying indebtedness  or if we incur additional indebtedness in order to make such repurchases or dividend payments  our total debt ratio may be adversely affected and we may not be permitted to make additional borrowings under our credit facility 
historically  our capital expenditures have not been significant 
in addition to property and equipment associated with radio station acquisitions  our capital expenditures have generally been related to maintenance of our office and studio space and the technological improvement  including hd radio  and maintenance of our broadcasting equipment 
however  we have purchased or constructed office and studio space in some of our markets to facilitate the consolidation of our operations 
the following summary table presents a comparison of our capital resources for the years ended december   and with respect to certain of our key measures affecting our liquidity 
the changes set forth in the table are discussed in greater detail below 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in despite a million increase in cash paid for programming and promotional expenses and selling expenses incurred in connection with generating the increase in sales and a million increase in cash paid for corporate general and administrative expenses 
the increase in net cash was primarily due to an million increase in cash receipts from the sale of advertising airtime and a million decrease in cash paid for interest during the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily due to a million increase in cash receipts from sales  a million decrease in cash paid for station operating expenses  a million decrease in cash paid for interest during

credit facility 
on february   we entered into a new credit facility consisting of a revolving credit loan with a maximum commitment of million and a term loan of million 
proceeds from the new credit facility were used to repay the old credit facility 
the revolving credit loan includes a million sub limit for letters of credit  which may be increased to million upon our request and with the approval of the bank of montreal  chicago branch in its capacity as a letter of credit issuer 
at our election  the revolving credit loan and term loan may bear interest at either the base rate or libor plus a margin that is determined by our debt to operating cash flow ratio 
the base rate is equal to the higher of the prime rate or the overnight federal funds rate plus 
interest on base rate loans is payable quarterly through maturity 
interest on libor loans is payable on the last day of the selected libor period and  if the selected period is longer than three months  every three months after the beginning of the libor period 
the revolving credit loan and term loan carried interest  based on libor  at and as of december  and  respectively  and mature on june  the scheduled reductions in the amount available under the revolving credit loan may require principal repayments if the outstanding balance at that time exceeds the new maximum amount available under the revolving credit loan

as of december   we had million in remaining commitments available under our new credit facility  however  as of december   our maximum consolidated total debt covenant would have limited additional borrowings to million 
the new credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and guaranteed jointly and severally by all of our subsidiaries 
the guarantees were issued to our lenders for repayment of the outstanding balance of the credit facility 
if we default under the terms of the credit facility  the subsidiaries may be required to perform under their guarantees 
the maximum amount of undiscounted payments the subsidiaries would have to make in 
table of contents the event of default is million 
the guarantees for the revolving credit loan and term loan expire on june  as of december   the scheduled repayments of the new credit facility for the next five years and thereafter are as follows revolving credit loan term loan total credit facility thereafter total we must pay a quarterly unused commitment fee equal to of the unused portion of the revolving credit loan 
for the year ended december   our unused commitment fee was million 
we are required to satisfy financial covenants  which require us to maintain specified financial ratios and to comply with financial tests  such as ratios for maximum total leverage  minimum interest coverage and minimum fixed charges 
as of december   these financial covenants included maximum consolidated total debt ratio 
as of december   our consolidated total debt must not have exceeded times our consolidated operating cash flow for the four quarters ending on such day as such terms are defined in the new credit agreement 
on the last day of each fiscal quarter for the period from january  through march   the maximum ratio remains times 
on the last day of each fiscal quarter for the period from april  through december   the maximum ratio is times

fixed charges include cash interest expense  cash tax expense  capital expenditures  agency and commitment fees  and scheduled principal repayments 
as of december   we believe that we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants 
as of december   as calculated pursuant to the terms of our new credit agreement  our consolidated total debt ratio was times consolidated operating cash flow  our interest coverage ratio was times interest expense  and our fixed charge coverage ratio was times fixed charges 
failure to comply with these financial covenants  scheduled interest payments  scheduled principal repayments  or any other terms of our credit facility could result in the acceleration of the maturity of our outstanding debt which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

table of contents the credit facility also contains other customary restrictive covenants 
these covenants limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens  enter into certain investments or joint ventures  consolidate  merge or effect asset sales  enter sale and lease back transactions  sell or discount accounts receivable  enter into transactions with affiliates or stockholders  or change the nature of our business 
as described elsewhere in this report  on june   our credit agreement was amended to permit us to repurchase up to million of our common stock and to pay dividends on our common stock in an amount up to an aggregate of million per year 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our credit facility upon expiration or on terms that will be acceptable to us

cautionary note regarding forward looking statements our form k disclosure and analysis concerning our operations  cash flows and financial position  including  in particular  the likelihood of our success in developing and expanding our business  include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
statements that are predictive in nature  that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions  or that include words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates and similar expressions are forward looking statements 
although these statements are based upon assumptions we consider reasonable  they are subject to risks and uncertainties that are described more fully below 
accordingly  we can give no assurance that we will achieve the results anticipated or implied by our forward looking statements 
risk factors we are dependent on federally issued licenses to operate our radio stations and are subject to extensive federal regulation 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the fcc under the communications act 
we are required to obtain licenses from the fcc to operate our radio stations 
licenses are normally granted 
table of contents for renewable terms of eight years 
although the vast majority of fcc radio station licenses are routinely renewed  we cannot assure you that the fcc will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will be for full eight year terms or will not include conditions or qualifications 
the non renewal  or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications  of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on us 
we must comply with extensive fcc regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations 
fcc regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market  which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some radio stations 
the fcc also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations 
if the fcc relaxes these technical requirements  it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could have a material adverse effect on us 
moreover  these fcc regulations and others may change over time and we cannot assure you that those changes would not have a material adverse effect on us 
the fcc has recently begun more vigorous enforcement of its indecency rules that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the fcc s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent material between the hours of am and pm 
broadcasters risk violating the prohibition on the broadcast of indecent material because of the vagueness of the fcc s definition of indecent material  coupled with the spontaneity of live programming 
the fcc in the last few years has stepped up its enforcement activities as they apply to indecency  and has threatened to initiate license revocation or license renewal proceedings against broadcast licensees for a category of undefined serious indecency violations 
the fcc has also expanded the breadth of indecency regulation to include material that could be considered blasphemy personally reviling epithets  profanity and vulgar or coarse words amounting to a nuisance 
legislation has also been introduced in congress that would significantly increase the penalties for broadcasting indecent programming  and depending on the number of violations engaged in  would potentially subject us to license revocation  renewal or qualifications proceedings in the event that we broadcast indecent material 
wqam am s license is currently subject to an objection and indecency related proceedings at the fcc  described below  and that license has not been renewed despite the fact that we timely filed a renewal application in october however  because we filed a timely renewal application  we continue to operate the radio station under this license in the ordinary course 
in february  the fcc initiated an enforcement inquiry in response to allegations that wqam am had broadcast indecent material on one day in september in november  the fcc issued to us a notice of apparent liability for a monetary forfeiture of  for alleged indecency violations relating to broadcasts on two additional days in september at wqam am 
in december  the fcc initiated an enforcement inquiry in response to allegations that wqam am had broadcast indecent material on eight different dates in on the howard stern show  that inquiry also relates to wrxk fm  which also carries the howard stern show 
we may in the future become subject to additional inquiries or proceedings related to our radio stations broadcast of indecent or obscene material 
to the extent that these pending inquiries or other proceedings result in the imposition of fines  revocation of any of our radio station licenses or denials of license renewal applications  our results of operation and business could be materially adversely affected 
we may not remain competitive if we do not respond to changes in technology  standards and services that affect our industry 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of other media technologies and services 
we may not have the resources to acquire and deploy other technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these other technologies 
competition arising 
table of contents from other technologies or regulatory change may have an adverse effect on the radio broadcasting industry or on our company 
various other audio technologies and services that have been developed and introduced  include satellite delivered digital audio radio services that offer numerous programming channels and sound quality of compact discs  audio programming by cable systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  internet content providers  personal communications services and other digital audio broadcast formats  am radio stations in the expanded am band  in band on channel digital radio  which provides multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services  and low power fm radio  which has resulted in non commercial fm radio broadcast outlets that serve small  localized areas 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that competition arising from other technologies or regulatory change may have on the radio broadcasting industry or on our financial condition and results of operations 
the radio broadcasting industry faces many unpredictable business risks that could have a material adverse affect on our advertising revenues 
our future operations are subject to many business risks  including those risks that specifically influence the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse affect on our business 
these risks include  but are not limited to shifts in population  demographics or audience preferences  increased competition for advertising revenues with other radio stations  television stations and other entertainment and communications media  and changes in government regulations and policies and actions of federal regulatory bodies  including the federal communications commission  internal revenue service  united states department of justice  and the federal trade commission 
in addition  we believe that for most businesses advertising is a discretionary business expense  meaning that spending on advertising tends to decline disproportionately during economic recession or downturn as compared to other types of business spending 
consequently  a recession or downturn in the united states economy or the economy of an individual geographic market in which we own or operate radio stations would likely adversely affect our advertising revenues and our results of operations 
our radio stations may not be able to compete effectively in their respective markets for advertising revenues  which could adversely affect our revenue and cash flow 
we operate in a highly competitive business 
a decline in our audience share or advertising rates in a particular market may cause a decline in the revenue and cash flow of our stations located in that market 
our radio stations compete for audiences and advertising revenues within their respective markets directly with other radio stations  as well as with other media 
these media include newspapers  magazines  network and cable television  outdoor advertising  direct mail  and satellite radio 
our radio stations could suffer a reduction in ratings or advertising revenue and could incur increased promotional and other expenses if another radio station in a market was to convert its programming to a format similar to  and thereby compete directly with  one of our radio stations  or a new radio station was to adopt a comparable format or if an existing competitor were to improve its audience share 

table of contents other radio broadcasting companies may enter into markets in which we operate or may operate in the future 
these companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we have 
our radio stations may not be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenues 
we may not be successful in identifying  financing  consummating and integrating future acquisitions  an element of our business strategy  which could significantly impair our future growth 
we believe that in order to continue to compete effectively in our industry  we need to identify radio stations that meet certain criteria and consummate acquisitions of such stations on terms that are both economically and commercially acceptable to us 
during the past three fiscal years  however  we were unable to identify any material radio station acquisitions that satisfied these requirements 
as a result  during that time  we did not acquire any stations 
while we intend to continue to pursue our acquisition strategy  we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify radio stations that meet our acquisition requirements and consummate future acquisitions 
additionally  even if we are successful in identifying acceptable targets  our ability to consummate acquisitions is subject to a number of risks  including the risks that our competitors may be able to outbid us for acquisitions because they have greater financial resources  required regulatory approvals may result in unanticipated delays in  or prohibitions of  completing acquisitions  and we may be unable to raise any additional financing necessary to consummate such acquisitions and additional financing may not be available to us on terms that are acceptable to us or permitted under our credit facility 
even if we are able to consummate acquisitions  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in integrating the operations of the acquired radio station or radio stations into our existing operations or that we will realize the benefits that we expect to realize in connection with such acquisitions 
moreover  consummating these acquisitions could also result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense as well as unforeseen contingent liabilities  all of which could have a material adverse effect of our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are not able to obtain regulatory approval for our acquisitions  our future growth may be impaired 
an important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of additional radio stations 
we may not be able to complete all the acquisitions that we may agree to make 
radio station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the fcc and  potentially  other regulatory authorities 
fcc regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market  which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some radio stations 
the fcc recently adopted rules  which could further limit the number of radio stations a licensee can own in a market  and may further restrict our ability to acquire and dispose of radio stations 
a temporary stay of these rules was recently lifted and they are now in effect 
also  the fcc in the past has adopted  and may re institute  procedures to review radio advertising concentration levels in proposed radio broadcasting transactions even if the proposed acquisition otherwise complies with the fcc s ownership limitations 
additionally  since the passage of the telecommunications act of  the justice department has become more involved in reviewing proposed acquisitions of radio stations and radio station networks 
the justice department is particularly concerned when the proposed buyer already owns one or more radio stations in the market of the station it is seeking to buy 
historically  the justice department has challenged a number of radio broadcasting transactions 
some of those challenges ultimately resulted in consent decrees requiring  among other things  divestitures of certain stations 
in general  the justice department has more closely scrutinized radio broadcasting acquisitions that result in local market shares in excess of of radio advertising revenue 

table of contents we have substantial debt that could have important consequences to you 
we have debt that is substantial in relation to our stockholders equity 
as of december   we had long term debt of million and stockholders equity of million 
our long term debt is substantial in amount and could have an impact on you 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes  including ongoing capital expenditures and future acquisitions  impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  limit our ability to compete  expand and make capital improvements  increase our vulnerability to economic downturns  limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and limit or prohibit our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions 
as of december   we had million in remaining commitments available under our credit facility  however  as of december  our maximum total leverage covenant would have limited additional borrowings to million 
our ability to reduce our total leverage ratio by increasing operating cash flow and or decreasing long term debt will determine how much  if any  of the remaining commitments under our credit facility will be available to us in the future 
poor financial results or unanticipated expenses could result in our failure to maintain or lower our total leverage ratio and we may not be permitted to make any additional borrowings under our credit facility 
moreover  we may need to modify or enter into a new credit facility to close on future acquisitions 
we also may seek to obtain other funding or additional financing in connection with the acquisition of radio stations  the full or partial repayment of our outstanding debt and or the payment of a dividend on our common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain other funding  additional financing or the approvals  if necessary  for any of these transactions 
any additional borrowings would further increase the amount of our debt and the associated risks 
in addition  there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available or on terms that will be acceptable to us 
we are subject to restrictive debt covenants  which may restrict our operational flexibility 
our credit facility contains various financial and operating covenants  including  among other things  restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  subject our assets to additional liens  enter into certain investments  consolidate  merge or effect asset sales  enter into sale and lease back transactions  sell or discount accounts receivable  enter into transactions with our affiliates or stockholders  change the nature of our business  pay dividends on and redeem or repurchase capital stock  or make other restricted payments 
these restrictions could limit our ability to take actions that require funds in excess of those available to us 
our credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy financial condition tests 
our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios and tests 
our breach of any of these covenants  ratios  tests or restrictions could result in an event of default under our credit facility 
if an event of default exists under our credit facility  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable 
if the lenders accelerate the payment of the indebtedness  we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness 
we may also incur future debt obligations in addition to  or in lieu of  our credit facility 
such future debt obligations might subject us to additional and different restrictive covenants that could further limit our operational flexibility or subject us to other events of default 

table of contents a downturn in the performance of our miami ft 
lauderdale could adversely affect our net revenue 
a ratings decline or other operating difficulty in the performance of our radio stations in miami ft 
lauderdale could have a disproportionately adverse affect on our consolidated net revenue 
for the year ended december   of our consolidated net revenue came from our radio stations in the miami ft 
lauderdale market 
because of the large portion of our consolidated net revenue from miami ft 
lauderdale we have greater exposure to adverse events or conditions affecting the economy in that market than would be the case if we were more geographically diverse 
our business depends on the efforts of key personnel and the loss of any one of them could have a material adverse affect on our business 
our business depends upon the continued efforts  abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key employees  including george g 
beasley  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
mr 
beasley is years old 
we believe the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by mr 
beasley would be difficult to replace and that the loss of mr 
beasley s or other key executives expertise could impair our ability to execute our operating and acquisition strategies 
our chairman of the board and chief executive officer controls beasley broadcast group  and members of his immediate family own a substantial equity interest in beasley broadcast group 
their interests may conflict with yours 
george g 
beasley  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  generally is able to control the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders 
without the approval of mr 
beasley  we will be unable to consummate transactions involving an actual or potential change in control  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares over then current market prices 
shares of class b common stock  that mr 
beasley beneficially owns  represent of the total voting power of all classes of our common stock 
mr 
beasley also has currently exercisable employee stock options to purchase  shares of class a common stock 
members of his immediate family also own significant amounts of class b common stock and  through stock options  class a common stock 
mr 
beasley will be able to direct our management and policies  except with respect to those matters requiring a class vote under the provisions of our amended certificate of incorporation  third amended and restated bylaws or applicable law 
historically  we have entered into certain transactions with george g 
beasley  members of his immediate family and affiliated entities that may conflict with the interests of our stockholders now or in the future 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
future sales by george g 
beasley or members of his family of our class a common stock could adversely affect its market price 
george g 
beasley and members of his family hold all of the outstanding shares of class b common stock  which is convertible to class a common stock on a one for one basis 
the market for our class a common stock could fall substantially if george g 
beasley and members of his family convert their shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock and then sell large amounts of shares of class a common stock in the public market 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  could make it more difficult for us to raise capital by selling equity or equity related securities in the future 
the difficulties associated with any attempt to gain control of our company may adversely affect the price of our class a common stock 
george g 
beasley controls the decision whether a change of control of beasley broadcast group will occur 
moreover  some provisions of our certificate of incorporation  by laws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change of control could be beneficial to you 
in addition  the communications act and fcc rules and policies limit the number of stations that one individual or 
table of contents entity can own  directly or by attribution  in a market 
fcc approval for transfers of control of fcc licensees and assignments of fcc licenses are also required 
because of the limitations and restrictions imposed on us by these provisions and regulations  the trading price of our class a common stock may be adversely affected 
there may not be an active market for our class a common stock  making it difficult for you to sell your stock 
our stock may not be actively traded 
an illiquid market for our stock may result in price volatility and poor execution of buy and sell orders for investors 
our stock price and trading volume have fluctuated widely for a number of reasons  including some reasons that may be unrelated to our business or results of operations 
this market volatility could depress the price of our class a common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  our operating results may be below expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this were to occur  the market price of our class a common stock could decrease  perhaps significantly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rate and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our credit facility 
as of december   all of our long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a one percentage point increase in the current interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our annualized interest expense would increase by million and net income would decrease by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management may take actions to further mitigate our exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this interest rate analysis assumes no such actions 
further  the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
as of december   we have entered into five interest rate swap agreements with a million aggregate notional amount 
these agreements expire from may to august as of december   the fair value of these agreements was an asset of million
