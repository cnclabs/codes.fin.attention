we manage our business as two separate segments  an exploration and production segment and a marketing segment 
we refer you to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report  which summarizes by segment our net income and capital expenditures for  and and our assets as of december   and executive summary chesapeake is the fourth largest independent producer of natural gas in the us and owns interests in approximately  producing oil and gas wells 
our primary operating area is the mid continent region of the united states  which includes oklahoma  western arkansas  southwestern kansas and the texas panhandle  and we are building significant secondary operating areas in the south texas and texas gulf coast region  the permian basin of western texas and eastern new mexico and in the ark la tex area of central and eastern texas and northern louisiana 
our revenues  operating results  profitability and future growth depend on our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable based on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil 
we favor gas over oil  strive to establish regional dominance in our operating areas  have grown through a combination of drilling and acquisitions and manage price risk through opportunistic oil and natural gas hedging 
we believe we have the largest onshore us inventories of leasehold and d seismic data more than million and million net acres  respectively with more than a seven year drilling backlog of  locations 
oil and natural gas production for was bcfe  an increase of bcfe  or  over the bcfe produced in we have increased our production for consecutive years and consecutive quarters 
during these quarters  chesapeake s domestic production has increased  for an average compound quarterly growth rate of and an average compound annual growth rate of 
we believe this is one of the two best operating performances in the industry during this time period 
in addition to increased oil and natural gas production  the prices we received were higher in than in on a natural gas equivalent basis  weighted average prices excluding the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives were per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in the increase in prices resulted in an increase in revenue of million  and increased production resulted in an increase in revenue of million  for a total increase in revenue of million excluding the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives 
in each of the core operating areas where chesapeake sells its oil and natural gas  established marketing and transportation infrastructures exist thereby contributing to high wellhead price realizations on all properties in which we own an economic interest 
chesapeake began with estimated proved reserves of  bcfe and ended the year with  bcfe 
taking into account production of bcfe  reserve replacement during the year was  bcfe  or of our production 
this compares to reserve replacement of and for and  respectively 
reserve additions through the drill bit were bcfe including bcfe from performance revisions and bcfe from revisions due to oil and natural gas price increases  or of the total increase in  and reserve additions through acquisitions  net of miscellaneous divestitures  were  bcfe  or of the total increase 
our decline rate on producing properties is projected to be in the first year  in year two  in year three  in year four and in year five 
during  chesapeake drilled net operated wells and participated in another net wells operated by other companies 
chesapeake s drilling costs were million for operated wells and million for non operated wells 
the company s success rate was 
our investment in leasehold and 
index to financial statements d seismic data totaled million exclusive of leases acquired through acquisitions and our acquisition expenditures totaled  million during excluding million of deferred taxes in connection with certain corporate acquisitions 
during  we received net proceeds of billion through issuances of million of common equity  million of preferred equity convertible preferred stock  million principal amount of senior notes due  million principal amount of senior notes due and million principal amount of senior notes due as of december   the company s debt as a percentage of total capitalization total capitalization is the sum of debt and stockholders equity was  compared to as of december  additionally  through debt repurchases and exchanges completed in  we have extended the average maturity of our long term debt to over nine years and have lowered our average interest rate to approximately 
during  all of our outstanding preferred stock was converted into  shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
also during  we exchanged  shares of our outstanding preferred stock for  shares of common stock 
in march  we paid million representing the balance outstanding on our senior notes upon their maturity and we redeemed the million outstanding balance of our senior notes due in december  we repurchased and retired million of our senior notes due for cash 
we subsequently repurchased and retired an additional million of our senior notes due for cash in january we intend to continue to focus on improving the strength of our balance sheet 
we believe our business strategy and operational performance will lead to an investment grade credit rating for our unsecured debt in the future 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity and uses of funds our primary source of liquidity to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures other than for certain acquisitions is cash flow from operations 
based on our current production  price and expense assumptions  we expect cash flow from operations will exceed our drilling capital expenditures in our budget for drilling  land and seismic activities during is currently between billion and billion 
while we believe this level of exploration and development will be sufficient to increase our reserves in and achieve our target of a to increase in production over production inclusive of acquisitions completed in through the filing date of this report but without regard to any additional acquisitions that may be completed in  higher drilling and field operating costs  drilling results that alter planned development schedules  acquisitions or other factors could cause us to revise our drilling program  which is largely discretionary 
any cash flow from operations not needed to fund our drilling program will be available for acquisitions  debt repayment or other general corporate purposes in cash provided by operating activities exclusive of changes in assets and liabilities was  million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase from to was primarily due to higher realized prices and higher volumes of oil and gas production 
the million increase from to was primarily due to higher prices and higher volumes produced 
we expect that production volumes will be higher than in and that cash provided by operating activities in will exceed levels 
while a precipitous decline in gas prices in would significantly affect the amount of cash flow that would be generated from operations  we have of our expected oil production in hedged at an average nymex price of per barrel of oil and of our expected natural gas production in hedged at an average nymex price of per mcf 
this level of hedging provides certainty of the cash flow we will receive for a substantial portion of our production 
depending on changes in oil and gas futures markets and management s view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends  however  we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions 

index to financial statements based on fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices  our hedging counterparties may require us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance from time to time 
at december  and march   we had million and million  respectively  of letters of credit securing our performance of hedging contracts 
to mitigate the liquidity impact of those collateral requirements  we have negotiated caps on the amount of collateral that we might be required to post with five of our counterparties 
all of our existing commodity hedges that are not under our secured hedge facility are with these counterparties and the maximum amount of collateral that we would be required to post with these counterparties is capped at million 
a significant source of liquidity is our billion revolving bank credit facility which matures in january at march   there was million of borrowing capacity available under the revolving bank credit facility 
we use the facility to fund daily operating activities and acquisitions as needed 
we borrowed  million and repaid  million in  and we borrowed and repaid million in and million in under our bank credit facility 
we incurred million  million and million of financing costs related to our revolving credit facility in  and  respectively  as a result of amendments to the credit facility agreement 
we believe that our available cash  cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our revolving bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operating  interest and general and administrative expenses  our capital expenditure budget  our short term contractual obligations and dividend payments at current levels for the foreseeable future 
our revolving bank credit facility and secured hedge facility are both syndicated facilities  neither of which contain material adverse or adequate assurance clauses 
although the applicable interest rates and commitment fees in our bank credit facility fluctuate slightly based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings  neither the bank facility nor the secured hedge facility contain provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the facilities or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings 
the public and institutional markets have been our principal source of capital to finance certain of our acquisitions 
we have sold debt and equity in both public and private offerings in the past  and we expect that these sources of capital will continue to be available to us in the future for acquisitions 
nevertheless  we caution that ready access to capital on reasonable terms and the availability of desirable acquisition targets at attractive prices are subject to many uncertainties  as explained under risk factors in item business 
the following table reflects the proceeds from sales of securities we issued in  and in millions total proceeds net proceeds total proceeds net proceeds total proceeds net proceeds unsecured senior notes guaranteed by subsidiaries convertible preferred stock common stock total we filed a million universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission on september  securities issued under this shelf may be in the form of common stock  preferred stock  depository shares representing fractional shares of preferred stock or debt securities of chesapeake

no securities have been issued under this shelf registration statement 
in june  we amended our certificate of incorporation to increase our authorized capital stock 
the number of authorized shares of our common stock increased from million to million and the number of authorized shares of our preferred stock increased from million to million 

index to financial statements we paid dividends on our common stock of million  million and million in  and  respectively  and we paid dividends on our preferred stock of million  million and million in  and  respectively

we paid million to purchase treasury stock in to fund our matching contributions to our k make up plan 
outstanding payments from certain disbursement accounts in excess of funded cash balances where no legal right of set off exists increased by million and million in and  respectively 
all disbursements are funded on the day they are presented to our bank using available cash on hand or draws on our credit facility 
historically  we have used significant funds to purchase and retire outstanding senior notes issued by chesapeake

during  we took several steps to improve our capital structure  including the transactions described below under financing transactions 
these transactions enabled us to extend our average maturity of long term debt to over nine years with an average interest rate of approximately 
the company s debt as a percentage of total capitalization decreased to and debt per mcfe of proved reserves decreased to per mcfe 
maintaining a debt to total capitalization ratio below and reducing debt per mcfe of proved reserves to below are key goals of our business strategy 
our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of oil and natural gas million at december  and exploration and production companies which own interests in properties we operate million at december  
this industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic  industry or other conditions 
we generally require letters of credit for receivables from customers which are judged to have sub standard credit  unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated 
our liquidity is not dependent on the use of off balance sheet financing arrangements  such as the securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities 
we have not relied on off balance sheet financing arrangements in the past and we do not intend to rely on such arrangements in the future as a source of liquidity 
we are not a commercial paper issuer

january and february amended our revolving bank credit facility to increase the committed borrowing base to billion and extend the maturity of the facility to january completed a private purchase of million of our senior notes due for million including premium of million and accrued interest of million 
contractual obligations we currently have a billion revolving bank credit facility which matures in january the credit facility was increased from million to billion in january as of december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under this facility and had utilized million of the facility for various letters of credit 
borrowings under the facility are collateralized by certain producing oil and gas properties and bear interest at either i the greater of the reference rate of union bank of california  na  or the federal funds effective rate plus or ii london interbank offered rate libor  at our option  plus a 
index to financial statements margin that varies according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings 
the collateral value and borrowing base are redetermined periodically 
the unused portion of the facility is subject to an annual commitment fee that also varies according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings 
currently the annual commitment fee is 
interest is payable quarterly or  if libor applies  it may be payable at more frequent intervals 
the credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  sell properties  purchase or redeem our capital stock  make investments or loans  and create liens 
prior to its amendment and restatement in january  the credit facility agreement required us to maintain a current ratio as defined of at least to and a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined of at least to at december   our current ratio was to and our fixed charge coverage ratio was to as amended  the agreement no longer includes a current ratio test 
the to fixed charge coverage ratio continues to apply and a new financial covenant was added requiring an indebtedness to ebitda ratio as defined not to exceed to under this test  our indebtedness to ebitda ratio at december  was to if we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants  the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable 
such acceleration  if involving a principal amount of million or more  would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures  which could in turn result in the acceleration of our senior note indebtedness 
the credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness we may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of million 
some of our commodity price and financial risk management arrangements require us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance to the counterparties in the event that our payment obligations exceed certain levels 
as of december   we were required to post million of collateral in the form of letters of credit with respect to such derivative transactions 
these collateral requirements were million as of march  future collateral requirements are uncertain and will depend on arrangements with our counterparties and fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices and interest rates 
we currently have arrangements with five of our counterparties which limit the amount of collateral that we would be required to post with a counterparty to no more than million each 
in may  we entered into a secured natural gas hedging facility with a nationally recognized counterparty 
under this hedging facility  which matures in may  we can enter into cash settled natural gas commodity transactions  valued by the counterparty  for up to million 
outstanding transactions under the facility are collateralized by certain oil and gas properties  exclusive of the oil and gas properties that collateralize our revolving bank credit facility 
the hedging facility is subject to an annual fee of of the maximum total capacity and a exposure fee  which is assessed quarterly on the average of the daily negative fair market value amounts  if any  during the quarter 
as of december   the fair market value of the natural gas hedging transactions related to the hedging facility was an asset of million 
the hedging facility contains the standard representations and default provisions that are typical of such agreements 
the agreement also contains various restrictive provisions which govern the aggregate gas production volumes that we are permitted to hedge under all of our agreements at any one time 
the hedging facility is guaranteed by chesapeake and its subsidiaries 
our subsidiary  chesapeake exploration limited partnership  is the borrower under our revolving bank credit facility and is the named party of our hedging facility 
the facilities are guaranteed by chesapeake and all its other subsidiaries 
our revolving bank credit facility and secured hedge facility are both syndicated facilities  neither of which contain material adverse or adequate assurance clauses 
although the applicable interest rates and commitment fees in our bank credit facility fluctuate slightly based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings  neither the bank facility nor the secured hedge facility contain provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the facilities or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings

debt ratings for the senior notes are ba by moody s investor service positive outlook  bb by standard poor s ratings services positive outlook and bb by fitch ratings 
our senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of chesapeake and rank equally with all of our other unsecured indebtedness 
all of our wholly owned subsidiaries guarantee the notes including chesapeake energy marketing  inc  mayfield processing  llc and midcon compression  llc  for which the guarantee became effective september  the indentures permit us to redeem the senior notes at any time at specified make whole or redemption prices 
the indentures contain covenants limiting our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem  repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  make investments and other restricted payments  incur liens  engage in transactions with affiliates  sell assets  and consolidate  merge or transfer assets 
the debt incurrence covenants do not presently restrict our ability to borrow under or expand our secured credit facility 
as of december   we estimate that secured commercial bank indebtedness of approximately billion could have been incurred under the most restrictive indenture covenant

index to financial statements hedging activities oil and gas hedging activities our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
executive management is involved in all risk management activities and the board of directors reviews the company s hedging program at every board of director s meeting 
we believe we have sufficient internal controls to prevent unauthorized hedging 
as of december   our oil and gas derivative instruments were comprised of swaps  cap swaps  basis protection swaps  call options and collars 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contains a description of each of these instruments 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
hedging allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our hedged oil and gas production 
we closely monitor the fair value of our hedging contracts and may elect to settle a contract prior to its scheduled maturity date in order to lock in a gain or loss 
commodity markets are volatile  and chesapeake s hedging activity is dynamic 
mark to market positions under oil and gas hedging contracts fluctuate with commodity prices 
as described above under contractual obligations  we may be required to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance if our payment obligations to our hedging counterparties exceed levels stated in our contracts 
realized gains and losses from our oil and gas derivatives resulted in a net decrease in oil and gas sales of million or per mcfe in  a net decrease of million or per mcfe in and a net increase of million or per mcfe in oil and gas sales also include changes in the fair value of oil and gas derivatives that do not qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas  as well as gains losses on ineffectiveness of instruments designated as cash flow hedges 
unrealized gains losses included in oil and gas sales in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
included in these unrealized gains losses are gains losses on ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges of million in  million in and million in changes in the fair value of oil and gas derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged commodities  and locked in gains and losses of derivative contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until being transferred to earnings in the month of related production 
these unrealized losses  net of related tax effects  totaled million  million and million as of december    and  respectively 
based upon the market prices at december   we expect to transfer to earnings approximately million of the income included in the balance of accumulated other comprehensive income during the next months when the transactions actually occur

to the extent interest rate swaps have been designated as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and the corresponding debt are reflected as adjustments to interest expense in the corresponding months covered by the derivative agreement 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded currently as adjustments to interest expense

these interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges of the related senior notes 
the settlement amounts received will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining terms of the related senior notes 
the senior notes hedged mature in and in  we closed the and interest rate swaps for gains totaling million 
these interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges of the related senior notes 
the settlement amounts received will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining terms of the related senior notes 
the senior notes hedged mature in and in march  chesapeake entered into an interest rate swap which requires chesapeake to pay a fixed rate of while the counterparty pays chesapeake a floating rate of six month libor plus on a notional amount of million 
the counterparty may elect to terminate the swap and cause it to be settled at the then current estimated fair value of the interest rate swap on march  and annually thereafter until march  the interest rate swap expires on march  chesapeake may elect to terminate the swap and cause it to be settled at the then current estimated fair value of the interest rate swap at any time during the term of the swap 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of million 
because the interest rate swap is not designated as a fair value hedge  changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
in  interest expense related to the swap included an unrealized loss of million and a realized loss of million 
in january  chesapeake acquired a million interest rate swap as part of the purchase of concho resources inc under the terms of the interest rate swap  the counterparty pays chesapeake a floating three month libor rate and chesapeake pays a fixed rate of 
payments are made quarterly and the interest rate swap extends through september an initial liability of million was recorded based on the fair value of the interest rate swap at the time of acquisition 
as of december   the interest rate swap had a negligible fair value 
because this instrument is not designated as a fair value hedge  an unrealized gain of million was recognized in as part of interest expense 
results of operations general

the increase in prices in resulted in an increase in revenue of million and increased production resulted in a million increase  for a total increase in revenues of million excluding unrealized gains or losses on oil and gas derivatives 
the increase in production from period to period was due to the combination of production growth from drilling as well as acquisitions completed during those periods 
for  we realized an average price per barrel of oil of  compared to in and in weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives 
natural gas prices realized per mcf excluding unrealized gains or losses on derivatives were  and in  and  respectively 
realized gains or losses from our oil and gas derivatives resulted in a net decrease in oil and gas revenues of million or per mcfe in  a net decrease of million or per mcfe in and a net increase of million or per mcfe in a change in oil and gas prices has a significant impact on our oil and gas revenues and cash flows 
assuming production levels  a change of per mcf of gas sold would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flow of approximately million and million  respectively  and a change of per barrel of oil sold would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flow of approximately million and million  respectively  without considering the effect of hedging activities

production expenses  which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes  were million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
on a unit of production basis  production expenses were per mcfe in compared to and per mcfe in and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to higher field service costs 
the decrease 
index to financial statements in costs on a per unit basis in is due primarily to lower production costs associated with properties acquired during the year and realization of efficiencies from a higher scale of operations in the mid continent region

general and administrative expenses  which are net of internal payroll and non payroll costs capitalized in our oil and gas properties see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were million in  million in and million in the increase in and was the result of the company s growth related to the various acquisitions which occurred in and and the increase in drilling activity associated with the growth of our exploration activities 
this growth has resulted in a substantial increase in employees and related costs 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses for will be between and per mcfe produced  which is approximately the same level as chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
we capitalized million  million and million of internal costs in  and  respectively  directly related to our oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development efforts 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation was million in  million in and million in during  million shares of restricted stock were granted to employees 
the cost of all outstanding restricted shares is amortized over a four year period which resulted in the recognition of million of stock based compensation costs during of this amount  million was reflected as stock based compensation expense a sub category of general and administrative costs in the consolidated statements of operations  and the remaining million was capitalized to oil and gas properties 
chesapeake did not issue restricted stock awards prior to additionally  we recognized million  million and million in stock based compensation expense in  and  respectively  as a result of modifications made to previously issued stock options 
stock based compensation was per mcfe for we anticipate that stock based compensation expense for will be between and per mcfe produced 
provision for legal settlements 
in  we recorded a provision for legal settlement of million related to certain pending litigation 
in  recorded a million provision related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit whereby we refunded certain royalty owners 
oil and gas depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties was million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the average dd a rate per mcfe  which is a function of capitalized costs  future development costs  and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented  was  and in  and 
index to financial statements  respectively 
the increase in the average rate from in to in is primarily the result of higher drilling costs  higher costs associated with acquisitions and the recognition of the tax effect of acquisition costs in excess of tax basis acquired in certain corporate acquisitions 
we expect the dd a rate to be between and per mcfe produced 
depreciation and amortization of other assets 
depreciation and amortization of other assets was million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in and was primarily the result of higher depreciation costs resulting from the acquisition of a processing plant  various gathering facilities  construction of new buildings at our corporate headquarters complex and at various field office locations and the purchase of additional information technology equipment and software in and property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight line basis 
buildings are depreciated over years  drilling rigs are depreciated over years and all other property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from two to fifteen years 
to the extent drilling rigs are used to drill our wells  a substantial portion of the depreciation is capitalized in oil and gas properties as exploration or development costs 
we expect depreciation and amortization of other assets to be between and per mcfe produced 
interest and other income 
interest and other income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the income consisted of million of interest income  million of income related to earnings on investments  and million of miscellaneous income 
the income consisted of million of interest income  a million loss on our investment in pioneer drilling company amex pdc  a million gain on the final settlement of the sale of our canadian subsidiary and million of miscellaneous income 
the income consisted of million in interest income  million of interest accrued on our investment in seven seas  a million gain on the sale of our investment in ram notes  a million loss on our investment in petroleum place and million of miscellaneous income 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in compared to million in and million in as follows years ended december  in millions interest expense on senior notes and revolving bank credit facility capitalized interest amortization of loan discount unrealized loss on interest rate derivatives realized gain on interest rate derivatives total interest expense average long term borrowings we use interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure to the volatility in interest rates 
for interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas  changes in fair value of interest rate derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets liabilities and the debt s carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative 
any resulting differences are recorded currently as ineffectiveness in the consolidated statements of operations as an adjustment to interest expense 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded currently as adjustments to interest expense 
a detailed explanation of our interest rate derivative activity appears below in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
interest expense  excluding unrealized gains losses on derivatives  was per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in and in we expect interest expense for to be between and per mcfe produced before considering the effect of interest rate derivatives 

index to financial statements loss on investment in seven seas 
in july  chesapeake purchased million principal amount of senior secured notes due issued by seven seas petroleum inc and detachable seven year warrants to purchase approximately million shares of seven seas common stock at an exercise price of approximately per share 
in the third quarter of  chesapeake recorded an impairment of million representing of the cost allocated to our seven seas common stock warrants 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional impairment of million to reduce our net investment in the senior secured notes  including accrued interest  to million  representing chesapeake s anticipated share of the net proceeds from the liquidation of seven seas assets in bankruptcy 
in the third quarter of  we received approximately million in proceeds from the sale of its principal assets 
seven seas reported in october that it had no source of additional cash flow and only contingent assets remaining  the value of which was considered speculative 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of we determined that any remaining assets of seven seas would not be adequate for us to realize the remaining investment on our books 
at that time  we recorded an impairment of million which reduced the carrying value of our investment to zero 
loss on repurchases or exchanges of debt 
during the past three years we have repurchased or exchanged chesapeake debt and incurred losses in connection with these transactions 
the following table shows the losses related to these transactions for  and  respectively in millions notes retired loss on repurchases exchanges for the year ended december  premium other a total senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due for the year ended december  senior notes due b for the year ended december  senior notes due c a includes write offs of discounts  deferred charges and interest rate derivatives associated with notes retired and transaction costs 
b includes a million loss that was recognized based on the hedging relationship between the notes and the interest rate derivative 
c includes a million gain that was recognized based on the hedging relationship between the notes and the interest rate derivative 
income tax expense 
chesapeake recorded income tax expense of million in compared to income tax expense of million in and million in our effective income tax rate decreased to in compared to in and in the decrease in and reflected the impact state income taxes and permanent differences had on our overall effective rate 
our effective income tax rate will increase to in to reflect our current assessment of the impact state income taxes and permanent differences will have on our overall effective rate 
during and  we determined that it was more likely than not that million and million  respectively  of the deferred tax assets related to louisiana net operating losses would not be realized and we recorded a valuation allowance equal to such amounts during those years 
in  we acquired louisiana oil and gas properties which resulted in us determining that it was more likely than not that the million of deferred tax assets related to louisiana net operating losses would be realized 
therefore  the million valuation allowance was reversed at december  as part of the recording of the purchase of these assets 
all income tax expense was deferred  and we expect most  if not all  of our and income tax expense to be deferred 

index to financial statements cumulative effect of accounting change 
effective january   chesapeake adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
upon adoption of sfas in  we recorded the discounted fair value of our expected future obligations of million  a cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  as an increase to earnings of million net of income taxes and an increase in net oil and gas properties of million 
loss on conversion exchange of preferred stock 
loss on conversion exchange of preferred stock was million in this loss was the result of a private exchange of million of our cumulative convertible preferred stock for million shares of common stock and a public exchange of million of our cumulative convertible preferred stock for million shares of common stock 
the loss on the exchanges represented the excess of the fair value of the common stock issued over the fair value of the securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms 
we also incurred million in transaction costs related to the public exchange 
application of critical accounting policies readers of this report and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the four policies we consider to be the most significant are discussed below 
the company s management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
hedging 
chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate our exposure to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas and interest rates 
recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction 
results of oil and gas derivative transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales  and results of interest rate hedging transactions are reflected in interest expense 
the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains losses within oil and gas sales or interest expense 
cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the same category within the statement of cash flows as the items being hedged  or on a basis consistent with the nature of the instruments 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas  is recognized immediately in oil and gas sales 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas  changes in fair value  as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  are recognized currently in earnings 
differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument  if any  represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings 
see hedging activities above and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities 

index to financial statements one of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives 
we have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources 
these values are based upon  among other things  futures prices  volatility  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at the inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates  the company s financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december   and  the net market value of our derivatives was an asset of million  a liability of million and a liability of million  respectively 
with respect to our derivatives held as of december   an increase or decrease in natural gas prices of per mmbtu would decrease or increase the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately million 
an increase or decrease in crude oil prices of per barrel would decrease or increase the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately million 
oil and gas properties 
the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of oil and gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result  our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher oil and gas depreciation  depletion and amortization rate 
capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil and gas reserves 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense is also based on the amount of estimated reserves 
if we maintain the same level of production year over year  the depreciation  depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves changes significantly 
proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying value of unproved properties  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
no income is recognized in connection with contractual services provided by chesapeake on properties in which we hold an economic interest 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
we review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties  and otherwise if impairment has occurred 
unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant 

index to financial statements we review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the securities and exchange commission on a quarterly basis 
this quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test 
under the ceiling test  capitalized costs  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues adjusted for cash flow hedges less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves  less any related income tax effects 
the two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and current prices  and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increases the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates 
as of december   approximately of our present value discounted at of estimated future net revenues of proved reserves was evaluated by independent petroleum engineers  with the balance evaluated by our internal reservoir engineers 
in addition  our internal engineers reevaluate our reserves on a quarterly basis 
all reserve estimates are prepared based upon a review of production histories and other geologic  economic  ownership and engineering data we developed 
the present value of estimated future net revenue shown is not intended to represent the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves we own 
additional information about our year end reserve evaluation is included under oil and gas reserves in item properties 
in addition  the prices of natural gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period 
price changes directly impact the estimated revenues from our properties and the associated present value of future net revenues 
such changes also impact the economic life of our properties and thereby affect the quantity of reserves that can be assigned to a property 
the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and the impact of revisions to reserve estimates can have a significant impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
our oil and gas depreciation  depletion and amortization rates have fluctuated between per mcfe in to per mcfe in reflecting the impact of changes in prices and finding costs during these periods 
as of december   a decrease in natural gas prices of per mcf and a decrease in oil prices of per barrel would reduce the company s estimated proved reserves by bcfe and by bcfe  respectively  and would also reduce the company s present value of estimated future net revenues by approximately million and million  respectively 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which chesapeake operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as derivative instruments  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and the net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
generally  to the extent chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provisions in the consolidated statement of operations 

index to financial statements under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists a the more positive evidence is necessary and b the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are taxable income projections in future years  whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits  future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures  and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition 
if a natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels and if such decreases were considered other than temporary  b exploration  drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels  or c we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our ability to realize our nol carryforwards prior to their expiration  we may be required to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of million 
accounting for business combinations 
our business has grown substantially through acquisitions and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise 
we have accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method  which is the only method permitted under sfas prior to the issuance of sfas  accounting for business combinations in  we applied the guidance provided by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 and its interpretations  as well as various other authoritative literature and interpretations that address issues encountered in accounting for business combinations 
the accounting for business combinations is complicated and involves the use of significant judgment 
under the purchase method of accounting  a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given  whether in the form of cash  assets  stock or the assumption of liabilities 
the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values  and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values 
the excess of the cost of an acquired entity  if any  over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity  if any  is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain acquired assets 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment  since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices  where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment  they can change as new information becomes available 
each of the business combinations completed during the past five years were of small to medium sized exploration and production companies with oil and gas interests 
we believe that the consideration we have paid to acquire these companies has represented the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the time of acquisition 
consequently  we have not recognized any goodwill from any of our business combinations  nor do we expect to recognize any goodwill from similar business combinations that we may complete in the future 
disclosures about effects of transactions with related parties as of december   we had accrued accounts receivable from our ceo and coo of million and million  respectively  representing joint interest billings from december which were invoiced and paid 
index to financial statements in january since chesapeake was founded in  our chief executive officer and chief operating officer have acquired small working interests in certain of our oil and gas properties by participating in our drilling activities 
joint interest billings to the ceo and coo are settled in cash immediately upon delivery of a monthly joint interest billing 
under their employment agreements  the ceo and coo are permitted to participate in all or none of the wells drilled by or on behalf of chesapeake during each calendar quarter  but they are not allowed to participate only in selected wells 
a participation election is required to be received by the compensation committee of chesapeake s board of directors days prior to the start of a quarter 
their participation is permitted only under the terms outlined in their employment agreements  which  among other things  limit their individual participation to a maximum working interest of in a well and prohibits participation in situations where chesapeake s working interest would be reduced below as a result of their participation 
in addition  the company is reimbursed for the cost of its leasehold acquired by the ceo and coo as a result of their well participation 
as disclosed in
