item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and operating results should be read in conjunction with item selected financial and other data and our audited annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
results of operations financial reporting during reorganization in connection with our bankruptcy proceedings  we were required to report in accordance with statement of position  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code  sop 
sop requires  among other things  i that pre petition liabilities that are subject to compromise be segregated in our consolidated balance sheet as liabilities subject to compromise and ii the identification of all transactions and events that are directly associated with our reorganization in the consolidated statement of operations 
seasonality typically  movie studios release films with the highest expected revenues during the summer and the holiday period between thanksgiving and christmas  causing seasonal fluctuations in revenues 
however  movie studios are increasingly introducing more popular film titles throughout the year 
in addition  in years where christmas falls on a weekend day  our revenues are typically lower because our patrons generally have shorter holiday periods away from work or school 
revenues we derive almost all of our revenues from box office admissions and concession sales 
we recognize admissions revenues when movie tickets are sold at the box office  and concession sales revenues when the products are sold in the theatre 
admissions and concession sales revenues depend primarily upon attendance  ticket price and the price and volume of concession sales 
our attendance is affected by the quality and timing of movie releases and our ability to obtain films that appeal to patrons in our markets 
we record proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale type certificates in current liabilities and recognize admission and concession revenue when a holder redeems a gift card or other advanced sale type certificate 
we recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale type certificates upon expiration 
expenses film exhibition costs vary according to box office admissions and are accrued based on the specified splits of receipts in firm term agreements with movie distributors 
the agreements usually provide for a decreasing percentage of box office admissions to be paid to the movie studio over the first few weeks of the movie s run  subject to a floor for later weeks 
where firm terms do not apply  film exhibition costs are accrued based on estimates of the final settlement that is agreed between us and the movie studio after the completion of the movie s run 
concession cost of sales are incurred as products are sold 
we purchase substantially all of our beverage supplies from the coca cola company 
we purchase substantially all of our other concession supplies from a single vendor of which we are the principal customer 

table of contents other theatre operating costs include labor  utilities and occupancy  and facility lease expenses 
labor costs have both a variable and fixed cost component 
during non peak periods  a minimum number of staff is required to operate a theatre facility 
however  to handle attendance volume increases  theatre staffing and thus salaries and wages vary in relation to revenues 
utilities  repairs and maintenance services also have variable and fixed costs components 
our occupancy expenses and property taxes are primarily fixed costs  as we are generally required to pay applicable taxes  insurance and fixed minimum rent 
our general and administrative expenses include costs not specific to theatre operations  and are composed primarily of corporate overhead 
net operating losses as of december   after utilizing approximately million for  we had approximately million of federal and state operating loss carryforwards with which to offset our future taxable income 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in the year the company is limited in using its net operating losses 
such limitation is projected to be million per year for the first five years beginning and will decrease to approximately million per year thereafter 
our ability to utilize such net operating losses is also subject to certain uncertainties regarding the application of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  to prior changes in ownership of the company  including the change resulting from the company s reorganization in january see risk factors we may be limited in our ability to utilize  or may not be able to utilize  net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our future tax liability for more information regarding these uncertainties

income tax expense 
we recognized an income tax expense of million for the year ended december   representing a combined federal and state tax rate of  compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  during the quarter ended december   we determined that the available positive evidence carried more weight than the historical negative evidence and concluded it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized in future periods 
therefore  the million valuation allowance was released creating an income tax benefit for the positive evidence management considered included operating income for and  our subsequent stock offering and refinancing  resulting in significant prospective interest expense reduction  and anticipated operating income and cash flows for future periods in sufficient amounts to realize the net deferred tax assets

table of contents depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  remained relatively flat compared to the year ended december  gain on sales of property and equipment for the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december  due to higher sales of surplus property

income tax expense benefit 
for the period ending december   the company recognized an income tax expense of million 
additionally  we will pay approximately thousand in alternative minimum taxes for the year ended december  during the quarter ended december   we determined the available positive evidence carried more weight than the historical negative evidence and concluded it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized in future periods 
therefore  the million valuation allowance was released creating an income tax benefit for the positive evidence management considered included operating income for and  our subsequent stock offering and refinancing  resulting in significant prospective interest expense reduction  and anticipated operating income and cash flows for future periods in sufficient amounts to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we recognized an income tax benefit of million in the income tax benefit recorded in is the result of the job creation and worker assistance act of  which allowed for additional carryback of net operating losses resulting in a cash refund of approximately million 
as is customary  the internal revenue service reviews refunds of this size 
this review was completed on november  with no adjustments made by the internal revenue service 
the new provision also temporarily suspends the limitation found in internal revenue code section d on the use of net operating loss carrybacks arising in tax years ending in and for alternative minimum tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources general our revenues are collected in cash and credit card payments 
because we receive our revenues in cash prior to the payment of related expenses  we have an operating float which partially finances our operations 
we had working capital of million as of december  compared to a working capital deficit of million at december  the change in working capital is primarily due to our refinancing completed on february  see note debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had available borrowing capacity of million under our revolving credit facility and approximately million in cash and cash equivalents on hand 
the material terms of our revolving credit facility are described below in material credit agreements and covenant compliance 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  this change is due to increased profit from operations related primarily to lower interest expenses  offset by changes in accounts payable  payments to general unsecured creditors and other reorganization items 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  due to increased construction of new theatres 
for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities was million compared to million for the year ended december  due to our refinancing 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  this change is due to increased profit from operations related primarily to lower interest expenses  offset by changes in accounts payable  payments to general unsecured creditors and other 
table of contents reorganization items 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities was million compared to million for the year ended december  our liquidity needs are funded by operating cash flow  sales of surplus assets  availability under our credit agreements and short term float 
the exhibition industry is very seasonal with the studios normally releasing their premiere film product during the holiday season or summer months 
this seasonal positioning of film product makes our needs for cash vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
additionally  the ultimate performance of the film product  any time during the calendar year  will have the most dramatic impact on our cash needs 
we plan to make the maximum capital expenditures allowed under the revolving credit facility for the foreseeable future 
the revolving credit facility currently limits capital expenditures to million annually  plus the carryover of any unused portion for the life of the facility 
we anticipate we will add approximately screens during the course of and close approximately screens in older theatres where leases will not be renewed 
the expenses associated with exiting these closed theatres typically relate to costs associated with removing owned equipment and is not material to our operations 
our ability to service our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate this cash will depend largely on future operations 
based upon our current level of operations  we believe that cash flow from operations  available cash  sales of surplus assets and borrowings under our credit agreements will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months 
however  the possibility exists that  if our liquidity needs are not met and we are unable to service our indebtedness  we could come into technical default under any of our debt instruments  causing the agents or trustees for those instruments to declare all payments due immediately or  in the case of the senior debt  to issue a payment blockage to the more junior debt 
a similar situation contributed to the circumstances that led us to file our voluntary petition for relief under chapter in august  as described in our reorganization 
we cannot make assurances that our business will continue to generate significant cash flow to fund our liquidity needs 
we are dependent to a large degree on the public s acceptance of the films released by the studios 
we are also subject to a high degree of competition and low barriers of entry into our industry 
in the future  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot make assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or raise additional capital through other means  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we have insufficient cash flow to fund our liquidity needs and are unable to refinance our indebtedness or raise additional capital  we could come into technical default under our debt instruments as described below 
in addition  we may be unable to pursue growth opportunities in new and existing markets and to fund our capital expenditure needs 
material credit agreements and covenant compliance as described below  our credit and leasing facilities contain certain restrictive provisions which  among other things  limit additional indebtedness  limit capital expenditures  limit the payment of dividends and other defined restricted payments  require that certain debt to capitalization ratios be maintained and require minimum levels of defined cash flows

in particular  our revolving credit agreement generally prohibits us from incurring additional indebtedness other than purchase money debt or capital leases less than million  acquired debt less than million or subordinated debt or other unsecured debt less than million  in each case subject to compliance with financial covenants 
subsequent to december   we executed amendment no 
to our revolving credit facility 
this amendment modified the definition of consolidated capital expenditures and increased the amount allowable as capital expenditures from million to million for the year ended december  and million annually  plus the carryover of any unused portion for the remaining life of the credit facility 
had we not negotiated this amendment we would have been in default under the maximum consolidated capital expenditures financial covenant for the year ended december  the revolving credit facility also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of consolidated total debt to adjusted ebitda no greater than to and adjusted ebitda to consolidated cash interest expense not less than to

notwithstanding this limitation  we are also permitted to incur other indebtedness  including purchase money debt and capital leases less than million  acquired debt of less than million and other unsecured debt of up to million 
the lenders under the term loan facility have a second priority security interest in substantially all our tangible and intangible assets  including the capital stock of our subsidiaries

upon a change in control  as defined in the term loan facility agreement  subject to certain exceptions  we are required to offer to repurchase from each lender all or any portion of each lender s term loans at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase

in addition  under the terms of the indenture governing the notes  we are prohibited from incurring any subordinated debt that is senior in any respect in right of payment to the notes 
we completed an exchange of the notes for registered notes with the same terms in august  upon a change of control  as defined in the indenture  subject to certain exceptions  we are required to offer to repurchase from each holder all or any part of each holder s notes at a purchase price of of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet financing transactions or arrangements other than disclosed in the table above 
asset impairments in and  we identified impairments of asset values for certain theatres which we reflected as operating expenses in our consolidated financial statements 
based on our analysis  no such charges were required in the table below sets out certain information concerning these impairments in millions except number of theatres and screens annual impairment charge included in operations reduction in carrying values reduction in accumulated depreciation and amortization expenses number of theatres affected number of screens affected the impairment charges in and were primarily caused by reductions in estimated theatre cash flows due to the impact of new or increased competition on certain older  auditorium style theatres  negative evaluation of the operating results produced from theatres previously converted to discount theatres  or our inability to improve a marginal theatre s operating results to a level that would support the carrying value of the long lived assets 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  
table of contents including those related to leasing transactions  depreciation of property and equipment  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies and  in particular  those related to impairment of long lived assets including goodwill 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions and such difference could be material 
all critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
property and equipment property and equipment are carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  or cost adjusted for recognized impairments 
assets held for disposal are reported at the lower of the asset s carrying amount or its fair value less costs to sell 
amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is included with depreciation expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we compute depreciation on a straight line basis as follows building and improvements years leasehold improvements years leasehold interests years capital leases years long term financing assets years equipment years number of years is based on the terms of the applicable lease impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as a purchase 
the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  were adopted on january  the provisions prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and require that these assets be tested periodically for impairment at least annually 
we consider all of our consolidated operations to be our reporting unit for sfas purposes 
the company tests goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year or on an interim basis should an event occur that may reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
as of december  and  our financial statements included acquisition related goodwill of million  net of previous amortization 
we account for our property and equipment in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

we review our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically review and monitor our internal management reports and the competition in our markets for indicators of impairment 
we consider a trend of operating results that are not in line with management s expectations to be the primary indicator of potential impairment 
an additional impairment indicator used by management is the existence of competition in a market  either from third parties or from our own expansion 
for purposes of sfas no 
 assets are evaluated for impairment at the theatre level except when multiple theatres are located in the same geographic area 
management believes this is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
we deem there to be an impairment if a forecast of undiscounted future operating cash flows directly related to the theatre or market  including estimated disposal value if any  is less than its carrying amount 
if there is a determination of an impairment  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the theatre or market exceeds its fair value 
fair value is based on management s estimates which are based on using the best information available  including prices for similar theatres or the results of valuation techniques such as discounting estimated future cash flows 
considerable judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
see asset impairments above for additional information regarding the effects on the and consolidated financial statements 

table of contents bankruptcy matters as debtors in possession  we had the right  subject to bankruptcy court approval and certain other limitations  to assume or reject executory contracts and unexpired leases during our reorganization 
any damages resulting from rejection of executory contracts or unexpired leases were treated as general unsecured claims in our reorganization 
during our reorganization  we received approval from the bankruptcy court to reject theatre leases on of our theatre locations 
we estimate that our aggregate liability at december  for general unsecured creditors is approximately million  which includes our estimated liability for damages resulting from the rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases which we have not already paid 
as of december   total accrued interest on those claims was  all of these claims are disputed 
as such  we cannot presently determine with certainty the ultimate liability that may result  however  the bankruptcy court still maintains jurisdiction over certain matters related to the implementation of the plan of reorganization  including the unresolved disputed claims 
we have made our best estimate of such liability given the facts available at this time 
if we are unable to resolve these claims with the unsecured creditors we may petition the bankruptcy court to resolve them 
on february   the company filed a motion seeking an order entering a final decree closing the bankruptcy cases 
on march   the united states bankruptcy court of the district of delaware entered a final decree closing the bankruptcy cases 
leases we operate most of our theatres under non cancelable operating lease agreements 
these leases generally provide for the payment of fixed monthly rentals  property taxes  common area maintenance  insurance and repairs 
certain of these leases provide for escalating lease payments over the terms of the leases 
moreover  certain leases also include contingent rental fees based on a percentage of sales 
at our option  we can renew a substantial portion of our theatre leases  at the then fair rental rate  for various periods with the maximum renewal period generally totaling years 
for financial statement purposes  the total amount of base rentals over the terms of the leases is charged to expense on the straight line method over the initial lease terms 
rental expense in excess of lease payments is recorded as a deferred rental liability and is amortized to rental expense over the remaining term of the lease 
percentage rent several leases have a contingent component called percentage rent 
percentage rent is based on a percentage of defined revenue factors over a fixed breakpoint for the lease year as described within the lease 
we accrue for this contingent liability monthly based on the trailing twelve months activity of the affected theatre 
payment of this liability is defined within the lease and the accrual is reconciled at the end of the lease year 
financing obligations the company is considered the owner of certain assets during construction under the provisions of emerging issues task force no 
 as we pay directly for a substantial portion of the construction costs 
once construction is completed  we consider the requirements under financial accounting standards no 
for sale treatment  and if the arrangement does not meet such requirements  we record the reimbursement of some of the construction costs from the landlord as a financing obligation 
the obligation is amortized over the lease term based on the rent payments designated in the contract 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under the sfas no 
 the liability method is used in accounting for income taxes 
in  we established a valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of statement of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we periodically review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets only as reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
for the year ended december   we determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
accordingly  the valuation of approximately million was released and a deferred tax asset of million was recognized 
if our profitability significantly decreases it could negatively impact our ability to utilize the deferred tax asset 
impact of recently issued accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r revises fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation 
in addition  fas r supercedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and amends fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows sfas 

table of contents sfas r requires companies to use fair value to measure stock based compensation awards and cease using the intrinsic value method of accounting  which apb no 
allowed  and resulted in no expense for many awards of stock options where the exercise price of the option equaled the price of the underlying stock at grant date 
the fair value of the award is not remeasured after its initial estimation on the grant date except under specific circumstances 
sfas r must be adopted no later than for periods beginning after june  based on our valuation under the black scholes option valuation model  presently used by the company and still appropriate under sfas r  the company estimates additional deferred compensation expense from adoption to be approximately million for the years ended december  and the company will evaluate other valuation methods  prior to implementation  to determine the most accurate for the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks 
we have floating rate debt instruments and  therefore  are subject to the market risk related to changes in interest rates 
interest paid on our debt is largely subject to changes in interest rates in the market 
our revolving credit facility and our five year term loan credit facility are based on a structure that is priced over an index or libor rate option 
an increase of in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our million term loan credit agreement  million on an annual basis 
if our million revolving credit agreement was fully drawn a increase in interest rates would increase interest expense  on an annual basis 
the interest rate on our senior subordinated notes is fixed and changes in interest rates will have no effect on annual interest expense 
a substantial number of our theatre leases have increases contingent on consumer price index cpi changes 
a change in cpi would not have a material effect on rent expense
