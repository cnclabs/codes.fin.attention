item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  as well as the information in item selected consolidated financial data 
overview we are an international industrial company with three business segments outdoor products  industrial and power equipment ipeg and lawnmower 
operating independently from one another  these segments focus on the manufacture and marketing of branded products to industrial companies and consumers 
our products are sold in over countries 
we believe we are a global leader in the sale of cutting chain and chainsaw accessories and a leading provider of timber harvesting equipment and zero turn riding lawnmowers to the north american markets 
our largest segment  outdoor products  accounted for of our revenue in this segment manufactures and markets chainsaw chain  guide bars  sprockets and accessories for chainsaw use  concrete cutting equipment  and lawnmower blades and accessories for outdoor care 
the segment s products are sold to oems for use on new chainsaws and landscaping equipment  and to the retail replacement market through distributors  dealers and mass merchants 
during approximately of the segment s sales were to oems  with the remaining sold into the replacement market 
approximately of the segment s sales were outside of the united states in the outdoor products segment s performance can be impacted by trends in the forestry industry  weather patterns  including natural disasters  foreign currency fluctuations and general economic conditions 
the segment faces competitive price pressure from competitors on a worldwide basis 
the efficient manufacture of the segment s products is critical to ensure that it is competitive with its selling prices  as is successful marketing of newly developed products such as our concrete cutting saws and replacement chain and bars 
this segment has three manufacturing plants in the united states  one in canada and one in brazil  all of which are focused on continuous cost improvement 
in the first quarter of we will be completing construction on the first phase of a production facility in china 
in we will also complete an expansion of our brazilian plant 
timely capital investment into these plants for added capacity and cost reductions  as well as effectively sourcing critical raw materials at favorable prices  is required to remain competitive 
the ipeg segment manufactures and markets timber harvesting equipment  industrial tractors and loaders  rotational bearings and mechanical power transmission units 
sales in this segment accounted for of our total sales in sales are made through a distribution network to customers in the timber harvesting  material handling  construction  land reclamation and utility businesses  as well as to pulp and lumber mills  contractors and scrap yard operators 
the segment s customer base is concentrated in the southeastern united states  with international sales amounting to of segment sales in in march  we entered into supply and marketing agreements with caterpillar inc caterpillar to distribute a line of purpose built forestry equipment to caterpillar dealers with the brand name of timberking 
under these agreements  some of the models of both the blount and the timberking product line are manufactured at our facilities and the others at caterpillar s facilities 
we are responsible for the marketing of both lines of products  and these arrangements have increased the segment s sales in both domestic and international markets and increased the utilization of the segment s manufacturing plants 
the performance of ipeg is aligned with overall trends in the forestry industry  including the import export balance of wood products  the utilization of lumber and paper mill capacity in the united states and the level of logging production 
the cyclical nature of the forestry industry can significantly impact the operating income and cash flow of ipeg from year to year 
to react to such trends  the segment must consistently manage its four united states manufacturing plants on a lean basis  tightly control the discounting of its products and minimize working capital 
the lawnmower segment represented of our sales in this segment manufactures and markets zero turn riding lawnmowers and related accessories under the dixon brand name 
dixon was the pioneer in zero turning technology 
this technology allows for more efficient grass cutting compared to conventional tractor style riding lawnmowers 
the segment s products are sold through full service dealers and distributors 
international sales were of total segment sales in the performance of the lawnmower segment is impacted by domestic economic conditions  seasonal weather patterns and changes in competitive offerings 
operating income and cash flow in this segment are dependent on providing quality products at competitive prices 
critical to the success of the segment is the offering of enhancements to existing models on an annual basis and the periodic introduction of new products in response to market demand 
the lawnmower segment operates a single united states facility for the manufacture and distribution of its products 
we maintain a corporate staff at our headquarters located in portland  oregon 
in addition to providing management oversight for the three business segments  the corporate staff manages our capital structure  administers various health and welfare plans and supervises compliance and legal matters 
our capital structure has undergone noteworthy changes in we began the year with a significant amount of debt outstanding and a concentration of common stock ownership by affiliates of lehman brothers holdings inc  including a wholly owned subsidiary of lehman brothers merchant banking partners ii  lp lehman merchant banking that owned approximately of our stock outstanding 
in august of we executed several refinancing transactions  and in december lehman merchant banking reduced its holdings to approximately through a secondary public offering of our stock 
as a result of these transactions  at the end of  our capital structure has a reduced  though still significant  amount of debt outstanding  and an ownership structure that no longer has a or greater shareholder 
even with these changes  however  our capital structure requires the conservation of cash in order to reduce debt and increase shareholder value 
in order to conserve cash  we place a high priority on minimizing working capital  appropriately allocating capital spending to higher return projects and leveraging existing assets for additional product output 
operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales for were million compared to million in operating income increased to million from million in net income in was million per diluted share compared to a net loss of million per diluted share in our sales in increased by million  or  from in addition to an improved economic climate  our sales increased during for the following reasons an increase in sales volume within the outdoor products segment  which yielded million  or  in additional sales in this increase is attributable to several factors  including the relative weakness of the us dollar provided a more competitive selling price for our products 
the segment s international sales increased by  or million  in the effects of natural disasters had an unusually large impact on demand for our products in the united states replacement market  and also contributed to the international sales growth 
the sale of new chainsaws by oems increased by a faster rate than normal 
contributing factors include lower price points for consumers through growing mass merchant distribution  higher oil costs resulting in increased use of wood as heating fuel  and the increase in natural disasters within the united states and elsewhere in the world 
the impact of a weaker us dollar resulted in increased sales of million due to the effects of foreign currency translation 
expansion of the timberking line of timber harvesting equipment in conjunction with the marketing and supply agreements with caterpillar generated million in incremental sales 
an increase in the number of blount branded timber harvesting equipment units resulted in a million increase in sales as the united states forestry market continued to improve from a cyclical downturn that began in and ended in higher average selling prices in our timber harvesting equipment business added million 
this was primarily due to increases in net prices  including a reduction of competitive discounts 
the introduction of a new dixon lawnmower product line featuring all steel bodies helped increase lawnmower segment sales by million  or operating income increased by million  or  from to the improvement is primarily due to a year over year gross profit increase of million  or  partially offset by a million  or  increase in selling  general and administrative expense sg a

the million increase in sales occurred across all product lines but was particularly strong for chainsaw parts and accessories and the products related to concrete cutting 
the continued weakening of the us dollar during provided a better competitive selling price and demand surged  in part due to an increase in severe weather events 
this increase included million due to volume alone 
foreign currency translation provided an additional million 
geographically  most major markets experienced improved demand  with international sales increasing by from to million 
from a channel standpoint  sales to oems and replacement sales grew by and  respectively 
the higher growth rate in sales to oems relates to industry growth in sales of chainsaws by chainsaw producers due to improvement in general economic conditions  the increase in natural disasters  and higher oil costs which result in more woodcutting for use as fuel

gross profit increased million  or  as increased sales volume contributed million 
gross profit as a percent of sales held even at 
operating leverage achieved through an increase in capacity utilization  to in compared to in was countered by downward pressure in unit margins due primarily to product mix

this model is the segment s first all steel body residential mower and was targeted for the growing high end residential and low end commercial zero turn riding mower market segments 
in  dixon continued with this focus  introducing additional all steel models for the model year 
the successful introduction of these changes has resulted in a increase in average unit selling prices even with the effect of our shift in marketing strategy towards distributors  where average prices are lower than through the dealer channel 
the million increase in lawnmower segment contribution to operating income in from was primarily due to the million increase in gross profit generated by the increase in unit sales 
the segment s plant operated at approximately of capacity in compared to in  helping offset other upward pressures in average production costs 
the combination of product cost and mix added an estimated million to cost of sales from the prior year

product cost and mix increased by million  or  as higher raw materials costs  employee wage increases and benefit costs were partially offset by productivity gains in our plants 
we instituted an average wage increase during and experienced higher benefit costs due to rising medical cost trends and increased pension expense  which was caused by reduced investment returns within the pension fund during recent years 
a million  or  increase in sg a costs tempered some of the gross profit increase 
the majority of this increase can be attributed to higher staffing levels to meet the needs of the growth in sales 
worldwide headcount in the sg a area increased by to people during the year

outdoor products segment 
sales for the outdoor products segment for were million compared to million in  a increase 
segment contribution to operating income in was million compared to million in  a increase 
the increase in sales was driven by stronger demand for chainsaw products and outdoor care equipment 
sales for our products increased in as the effects of a weaker us dollar provided a better competitive selling price and demand surged  in part due to a hurricane  forest fires in the united states and increased tree limb cutting that resulted from the northeast power outage in august 
additionally  the sales of our outdoor care products were expanded through increased use of the oregon brand name to gain new distribution 
prior to  many of these products were not marketed under the oregon brand name 
the outdoor products segment s sales increased by million in volume accounted for million of this increase  with foreign currency translation amounting to million 
geographically  most major markets experienced improved demand  with international sales increasing by from to million 
from a channel standpoint  sales to oems and replacement sales grew by and  respectively 
the higher growth rate in sales to oems reflects weaker results in  which were negatively impacted by higher customer inventory levels 
segment contribution to operating income increased by million in due to a million  or  increase in gross profit  partially offset by a million  or  increase in sg a expenses 
the improvement in gross profit reflects higher sales volume of million and the net favorable impact of foreign currency of million 
included in the sales volume impact are the favorable effects of increasing the utilization of the segment s manufacturing facilities to  which resulted in additional operating cost leverage 
the net translation impact of currency is primarily from a stronger euro  partially offset by the effect of a stronger canadian dollar on our canadian manufacturing plant 
sg a costs increased due to the effects of currency translation on the international operations  amounting to million  and higher incentive compensation costs of million due to achievement of above target performance 
these increases were partially offset by a million cost reduction involving the transfer of individuals to the corporate office at the start of industrial and power equipment segment 
sales for the industrial and power equipment segment for were million compared to million in  a increase 
segment contribution to operating income in was million compared to million in  a increase 
this segment is a cyclical  capital goods business whose results are closely linked to the performance of the forestry industry in general  particularly in our most important market  the southeastern united states 
during  the industry conditions in north america trended upward as pulp and lumber pricing improved  housing construction remained strong and imports of wood products declined due to the weakening of the us dollar 
the resulting improvement in demand for our products yielded a  or million  increase in timber harvesting equipment sales 
increased volume accounted for million of the increase  with higher average selling prices adding an additional million 
included in the increased volume was million in sales related to the joint marketing agreement with caterpillar initiated during offsetting some of the gain in timber harvesting sales was a  or million  decline in the sales of power transmission components from as improvements in the utility and construction markets that are served by the segment lagged behind the recovery generally experienced in the forestry industry 
the majority  or  of this decline was volume related  but average selling prices also declined slightly due to competitive pricing 
segment contribution to operating income in increased by million compared to the increase in profitability was the result of higher sales levels and increases in selling prices 
gross profit increased million  or  as increased sales contributed million 
the higher average selling price accounted for million of this increase 
included in the volume impact is the favorable result of increasing plant utilization to in from in cost of sales increased  or million  due to higher costs of raw materials  product liability and a higher inventory valuation allowance 
sg a costs increased by million  or  due to incremental marketing costs from the caterpillar agreement and higher benefit costs 
lawnmower segment 
sales in the lawnmower segment declined million in to million from million in the segment had a contribution loss of million in compared to a segment contribution of million in the decline in sales was primarily due to a reduction in unit volume  accounting for million of the decrease  as increased competition reduced our market share in the zero turn riding mower market 
in addition to the increase in competition  we experienced a weaker than normal spring selling season due to unfavorable weather conditions 
the million reduction in lawnmower segment contribution in from was primarily due to the million negative impact from unit volume decline 
the segment s plant operated at approximately of capacity in  resulting in higher average production costs 
additionally  manufacturing costs were negatively impacted by higher health care trends and other benefit costs 
during we incurred an above average number of medical and workers compensation claims that are not expected to continue at the same rate in the future 
corporate expense 
corporate expenses for increased to million from million in the increase in expense was due  in part  to the reassignment of certain functions from the outdoor products segment to corporate during the impact of this reassignment was approximately million 
these costs relate to completion of the relocation of our headquarters in late  and reflect wages and benefits of employees that were transferred from the outdoor products segment to the corporate staff at the start of additional increases were incurred in for pension and post retirement expenses of million  accrued incentive compensation of million  legal costs of million  compliance costs of million  and increased insurance costs of million 
restructuring expense in of million was related to severance benefits in conjunction with the movement of company assets between manufacturing facilities 
during we incurred million in restructuring expense for the movement of manufacturing assets and million for the relocation of our headquarters from montgomery  alabama to portland  oregon see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net interest expense in was million in comparison to million in the lower interest expense was due to a combination of lower average debt outstanding and lower interest rates on our term loans  as well as an increase in interest income of million relating to income tax refunds 
other expense for was million and included an expense of million related to the early retirement of debt in conjunction with the extinguishment of our prior term loan and revolver facility see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other expense for was million and included a million loss on the sale of our former corporate headquarters in montgomery  alabama and a fractional interest in an aircraft  million for the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs  together with prepayment penalties related to the early payment of debt from the net proceeds generated from the sale of assets and a million loss on an executive benefit trust  offset by million in income from life insurance proceeds 
our effective income tax rate in was compared to in this significant increase was primarily due to the recognition of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million during the third quarter of the year 
we determined at that time that it was more likely than not that all of our deferred tax asset would not be utilized 
we made this determination based on the following available evidence with the completion of the federal income tax return in september  we exhausted our ability to carry back operating losses to prior years 
in conjunction with the filing of the federal income tax return  we submitted a refund claim in the amount of million for taxes paid in accumulated operating losses can only be used to offset future domestic operating income 
we had not recorded domestic operating income since and were projecting a domestic operating loss for the fiscal year 
our high leverage and associated domestic based interest expense were projected to limit our ability to become profitable in the united states in the foreseeable future despite recent improvements in market conditions 
our operating income was due to profitable international operations partially offset by domestic operating losses 
we had valid tax planning strategies available including a potential debt buyback strategy for our outstanding bonds that had been trading at a substantial discount to utilize the benefit of accumulated net operating losses as of the end of that dissipated during the first nine months of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we did not record any income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  net income from discontinued operations in of million was primarily due to proceeds on a settlement of a claim involving our former construction business 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources at december   as a result of the merger and recapitalization transactions see note of notes to consolidated financial statements the merger and recapitalization  we had significant amounts of debt  with interest payments on notes and interest and principal payments under the credit facility representing significant obligations for us 
in the last two years we have initiated certain actions to reduce our debt and related interest expense 
in we entered into a new senior credit facility to replace a previous credit facility 
this credit facility consisted of a million revolving credit facility  a term a loan of up to million  a term b loan of up to million and a canadian term loan of up to million 
on august   we executed a series of refinancing transactions 
these transactions  referred to as the refinancing transactions  included the issuance of  shares of company common stock  which generated gross proceeds of million  the issuance of new senior subordinated notes due in that generated gross proceeds of million  and  the amendment and restatement of our existing senior credit facilities  including an increase in amounts available  with the total amounts drawn increasing by million 
we then used the net proceeds of these financing transactions as follows the redemption of our senior notes with million principal outstanding  the redemption of our senior subordinated notes with million principal outstanding  the repayment of our convertible preferred equivalent security for million principal and accrued payment in kind interest outstanding  and  the payment of related fees and expenses of million 
on december   we again amended our senior credit facilities to  among other things  provide repayment of the million second collateral institutional loan  established in august  with the proceeds from a new incremental term loan b of a like amount  and otherwise to achieve a lower borrowing rate and to amend certain financial covenants 
total debt at december  was million compared with total debt at december  of million 
our term loans are subject to certain reporting and financial covenant compliance requirements and we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  non compliance with these covenants could result in severe limitations to our overall liquidity 
the term loan lenders could require actions for immediate repayment of outstanding amounts  including the potential sale of our assets 
our debt is not subject to any triggers that would require early payment of debt due to any adverse change in our credit rating  although our credit ratings can result in increases or decreases to our borrowing rate 
outstanding debt as of december  consisted of term loans of million and senior subordinated notes of million  with a weighted average interest rate of 
the company and all of our domestic subsidiaries other than blount  inc guarantee blount  inc s obligations under the senior credit facilities 
the obligations under the senior credit facilities are collateralized by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of blount  inc and its domestic subsidiaries  as well as a pledge of all of blount  inc s capital stock 
in addition  blount  inc 
has pledged of the stock of its non domestic subsidiaries as further collateral 
interest and principal payment obligations have been reduced as a result of these changes to our debt structure and the company is now benefiting from lower interest expense 
interest expense was million in the fourth quarter of compared to million for the same period in interest expense has been reduced primarily due to a reduction in our average borrowing rate  and to a lesser extent the reduction in long term debt 
our annual interest expense may vary in the future due to the fact that the senior credit facility interest rates are variable 
cash interest paid to our lenders in was million  excluding million cash interest related to the day notice period for the redemption transactions  compared to million in the million  or  decrease in interest expense during the fourth quarter of will continue into  and will result in reduced cash interest payments during principal payments have also been affected by the new debt structure  and most significantly  a million payment required to redeem our former senior notes by june of has been satisfied 
the company s debt continues to be significant and interest and principal payments continue to represent substantial obligations 
this degree of leverage may adversely affect our operations and could have important consequences  including the following a substantial portion of cash flows available from operations continue to be required for the payment of interest expense and principal  which reduces the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and investment in future business opportunities  a substantial decrease in net income and cash flows or an increase in expenses may make it difficult to meet debt service requirements or force us to modify operations  the amount of leverage continues to make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressure  and the ability to obtain additional financing to fund our operational needs may be impaired or may not be available on favorable terms 
we intend to fund working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next twelve months through expected cash flows generated from operations 
interest on loan and credit facilities is payable in arrears according to varying interest rates and periods 
the company expects its remaining resources will be sufficient to cover any additional increases in working capital and capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will be the case 
we may also consider other options available to us in connection with future liquidity needs 
the revolving credit facility  previously with availability of up to million  has been amended and restated and increased to million as part of the refinancing transactions  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amount available to be drawn on the revolving credit facility could be restricted by our leverage ratio and first lien credit facilities leverage ratio 
under the amended and restated agreement  availability is determined by adjusting for outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility 
at december   the company had no amount drawn down on this facility and had borrowing availability of million 
this compares to december  when the company had no amount drawn down and million available 
cash balances at december  were million compared to million at december  the increase of million in cash balance for compares to an increase of million in cash generated by operating activities in was million compared to million for the million increase in generated cash reflects the following year over year increase in earnings before taxes of million  after adjusting for the expenses associated with the early extinguishment of debt  million of tax refund and related interest income recorded in was received during  effect of increase in business activity on working capital accounts used an additional million as follows additional usage of million for accounts receivable  million for inventories  and million for accrued expenses offset buy million additional source due to the growth in accounts payable  year over year increase in contributions to funded pension plans of million  and  cash generation during included the release of million previously held in escrow in connection with the disposition of assets in a prior year 
the net increase in accounts receivable  due primarily to the increase in sales  also includes a reduction in allowance for doubtful accounts of million to million at december  from million reported on december  the decrease in the allowance reflects the combination of actual amounts written off and reduction in specific concerns included in the december  balance  offset partially by an increase in trade receivables 
as a result of the decline in asset values of our company sponsored defined benefit plan during and  annual cash contributions to the pension fund increased in and further increased in the decline in asset value is due to overall weakness in the stock and bond markets prior to cash contributions for all funded plans were million for and million for we did not make any contributions to our other post retirement benefit plans in the company will make contributions to our funded pension plans in  estimated at million  and we believe that cash flow from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to cover the planned pension contribution levels 
furthermore  we have adjusted our minimum pension liability in accordance with sfas no

we maintain arrangements with third party finance companies by which certain customers of our industrial and power equipment segment and dixon may finance the purchase of equipment 
as part of these arrangements  we may be required to repurchase certain equipment from the third party financing companies should a customer default on payment 
as of december   the maximum repurchase obligation was million 
additionally  under our agreement  another third party financing company may require us to reimburse the third party financing company for its net loss 
the maximum exposure with respect to this net loss position is million 
these arrangements have not had a material effect on our operating results in the past since  with respect to the repurchase obligations  any equipment repurchased has historically been resold with minimal  if any  loss recognized 
we do not expect to incur any material charges related to these agreements in future periods 
as of december  our contractual obligations  including payments due by period  are as follows in millions dollar amounts in millions total thereafter debt obligations estimated interest payments purchase commitments operating lease obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations expected future interest payments based on existing debt 
variable interest rate debt payments based on assumed interest rate increases 
primarily related to the receipt of various goods and services as of december  advisory and consulting fees for certain current and former officers and directors of the company and the expected contribution to the funded pension plan 
we expect cash flow from operations and the amounts available under our revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to cover any additional increases in working capital 
while there can be no assurance  management believes we will comply with all financial performance covenants during the next twelve months 
should we not comply with the covenants  additional significant actions will be required 
these actions may include  among others  an attempt to renegotiate our debt facilities  sales of assets  restructuring and reductions in capital expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements in january  the fasb issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
we do not have any variable interest entities or off balance sheet arrangements as defined by this pronouncement 
market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities  and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivatives 
when utilized  derivatives are used as risk management tools and not for trading or speculative purposes 
see interest rate risk and commodity price risk below for discussion of our expectations as regards to future use of interest rate and commodity price derivatives 
interest rate risk 
we manage our ratio of fixed to variable rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate 
historically  we have  on occasion  entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange fixed and variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts and we have entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the interest rate of an anticipated debt issue 
at december  and  no derivative financial instruments were outstanding to hedge interest rate risk 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt outstanding by million 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rates on our variable rate long term debt for a duration of one year would increase interest expense by approximately million in foreign currency exchange risk 
approximately of the outdoor products segment s sales and of its operating costs and expenses were transacted in foreign currencies in as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates impact the amount of the outdoor products segment s reported sales and operating income 
historically  our principal exposures have been related to local currency operating costs and expenses in canada and brazil  and local currency sales and expenses in europe principally france and germany 
during the past three years  we have not used derivatives to manage any foreign currency exchange risk and  at december   no foreign currency exchange derivatives were outstanding 
the table below illustrates the estimated effect of a hypothetical immediate change in major currencies defined for us as the euro  canadian dollar and brazilian real effect of weaker us dollar dollar amounts in millions sales cost of sales operating income euro canadian dollar brazilian real commodity price risk 
we secure raw materials through purchasing functions at each of our operating divisions 
these functions are staffed by professionals who determine the sourcing of materials by assessing quality  availability  price and service of potential vendors 
when possible  multiple vendors are utilized to ensure competitive prices and to minimize risk of lack of availability of materials 
some of these raw materials are subject to price volatility over time 
we have not hedged against the price volatility of any raw materials within our operating segments by using any derivative instruments during  or our largest sourced commodity is steel  purchases of which in the year ended december  amounted to approximately million 
a hypothetical immediate change in the price of steel would have an estimated million effect on pre tax income in we utilize multiple suppliers to purchase steel 
raw material price volatility has not been significant in recent years  with the exception of steel pricing  which has risen sharply in the past year 
we estimate the impact of this increase resulted in our cost of purchased steel to be million higher in than in partially to offset this cost increase  some selling prices to our customers have been increased 
we source many of our outdoor care products from asia through brokers and we anticipate expanding this practice in our other divisions 
for example  we believe that we can source both timber harvesting and lawnmower components at a lower cost from international locations 
historically  we have not incurred any issues of significance in sourcing internationally  in part due to the fact that there are multiple suppliers for the products we purchase 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable and consistent with industry practice 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we record reductions to selling prices as products are shipped 
these reductions are based on competitive and market conditions  in addition to specific customer contracts in some instances 
these reductions are estimated and recorded at the time of shipment either through a reduction to invoice or the establishment of an accrual for payment at a later date 
the amount accrued may increase or decrease prior to payment due to customer performance and market conditions 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments 
such allowance is based on an ongoing review of customer payments against terms and a review of customers financial statements and conditions through monitoring services 
based on these reviews  additional allowances may be required and are recorded in the appropriate period 
specific industry market conditions can significantly increase or decrease the level of inventory on hand in any of our business units 
we adjust for changes in demand by reducing or increasing production levels 
we estimate the required inventory reserves for excess or obsolete inventory by assessing inventory turns and market selling prices on a product by product basis 
we maintain such reserves until a product is sold or market conditions require an increase in the reserves 
we offer certain warranties with the sale of our products 
the warranty obligation is recorded as a charge to cost of goods sold and as a liability on the balance sheet and is estimated based upon historic customer claims  supplier performance and new product reliability analysis 
should a change in trend occur in customer claims  an increase or decrease in the warranty liability may be necessary 
we incur expenses in connection with product liability claims as a result of alleged product malfunctions or defects 
we maintain insurance for a portion of this exposure and record a liability for our non insured obligations 
we estimate our product liability obligations on a case by case basis  in addition to a review of product performance trends 
these estimated obligations may be increased or decreased as more information on specific cases becomes available or performance trends change 
we determine our post retirement obligations on an actuarial basis that requires management to make certain assumptions 
these assumptions include the long term rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate to be used in calculating the applicable benefit obligation and the anticipated trend in health care costs 
these assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis and consideration is given to market conditions  as well as to the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and no 
 employers accounting for post retirement costs other than pensions 
the assumed rate of return on plan assets was for and we anticipate the same rate to be utilized in we believe this rate is reasonable  given the asset composition and long term historic trends 
we lowered our discount rate assumption to to determine our plan liabilities at december  from in the previous year due to the market declines in benchmark interest rates 
we assumed that health care costs in would increase by per year and future increases would decline by per year until is reached 
our annual post retirement expenses can be impacted by changes in these assumptions 
a change in the return on assets would change annual pension expense by million 
a decrease in the discount rate as of december  would result in million in increased pension expenses in and a increase in the discount rate as of december  would decrease pension expense in by million 
a change in the health care cost trend assumption for and beyond would change annual post retirement medical costs by approximately million a year 
on december   the president signed the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of this act introduces a federal subsidy to employers whose prescription drug benefits are actuarially equivalent to the new medicare part d 
the company believes its post retirement medical plan is actuarially equivalent to part d and as such is reflecting a reduction in the annual net periodic postretirement benefit cost of million  on account of the expected subsidy from medicare part d 
the reduction of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost is comprised of a million reduction in the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation attributed to past service  a million reduction in actuarial losses  and a million reduction in the current period s service cost 
in accordance with sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
as of december  we have a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million
