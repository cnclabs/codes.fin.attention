item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview dte energy is a diversified energy company with approximately billion in revenues in and approximately billion in assets at december  we are the parent company of detroit edison and michcon  regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales and distribution services throughout southeastern michigan 
additionally  we have numerous non utility subsidiaries involved in energy related businesses predominantly in the midwest and eastern us a significant portion of our earnings is derived from our utility operations  synthetic fuel business  and energy marketing and trading operations 
earnings in were million  or per diluted share  down from earnings of million  or per diluted share 
as discussed in the results of operations section that follows  the comparability of earnings was impacted by discontinued businesses and the adoption of new accounting rules 
excluding discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes  earnings from continuing operations in were million  or per diluted share  compared to earnings of million  or per diluted share for the same period 
income reflects reduced contributions from our utility operations  partially offset by increased contributions from our non utility businesses and corporate other 
significant items that influenced our financial performance and or may affect future results are electric customer choice penetration  electric and gas rate orders  higher operating costs  weather  synfuel related earnings and the risk of higher oil prices  and growth of non utility businesses 
electric customer choice program since  michigan residents and businesses have had the option of participating in the electric customer choice program 
this program is designed to give all customers added choices and the opportunity to benefit from lower power costs resulting from competition 
however  detroit edison s rates are regulated by the michigan public service commission mpsc  while alternative suppliers can charge market based rates 
this regulation has hindered detroit edison s ability to retain customers 
in addition  the mpsc has maintained regulated rates for certain groups of customers that exceed the cost of service to those customers 
this has resulted in high levels of participation in the electric customer choice program by those customers that have the highest rates relative to their cost of service  primarily commercial and industrial businesses 
as a result  our margins continue to be affected 
to address this issue  we filed a revenue neutral rate restructuring proposal in february designed to adjust rates for each customer class to be reflective of the full costs incurred to service such customers 
under the proposal  detroit edison s commercial and industrial rates would be lowered in  but residential rates would increase over a five year period beginning in the number and mix of customers participating in the electric customer choice program could be impacted under the rate restructuring 
lost margins and electricity volumes associated with electric customer choice were approximately million and  gigawatthours gwh in this compares with lost electric customer choice margins and volumes of approximately million and  gwh in the financial impact of electric customer choice was affected by the issuance of electric interim and final rate orders that increased base rates  authorized transition charges and reaffirmed the resumption of the power supply cost recovery pscr mechanism  as subsequently discussed 
partially offsetting the impact of lost margins on income  we recorded regulatory assets representing stranded costs that we believe are 
table of contents recoverable under existing michigan legislation and mpsc orders 
there are a number of variables and estimates that impact the level of recoverable stranded costs  including weather  sales mix and transition charges 
as a result  our estimate of stranded costs could increase or decrease 
as subsequently discussed  the mpsc authorized the recovery of million in stranded costs for the period of january through february detroit edison rate orders  along with the rate restructuring proposal  address certain issues with the electric customer choice program 
however  current regulation continues to hinder our ability to retain certain customers 
accordingly  we will continue working with the mpsc and michigan legislature to address other issues associated with the electric customer choice program 
electric rate orders in  public act pa froze electric rates for all residential  commercial and industrial customers through the legislation also prevented rate increases or capped rates for small commercial and industrial customers through and for residential customers through the rate freeze and caps apply to base rates as well as rates designed to recover fuel and purchased power costs which has traditionally been a cost pass through under the power supply cost recovery pscr mechanism 
in  the mpsc issued interim and final rate orders that authorized electric rate increases totaling million  and eliminated transition credits and implemented transition charges for electric customer choice customers 
the increases were applicable to all customers not subject to a rate cap 
the interim order affirmed the resumption of the pscr mechanism for both capped and uncapped customers  which reduced pscr revenues by million in however  the order allowed detroit edison to increase base rates for customers still subject to a cap in an equal and offsetting amount to the change in the pscr factor to maintain the total capped rate levels in effect for these customers 
the mpsc also authorized the recovery of approximately million in regulatory assets  including stranded costs 
as a result of rate caps  regulatory asset adjustments and other factors  the rate orders decreased earnings by million 
the impact of the rate orders is expected to increase earnings in and as rate caps expire 
effect of interim and final rate orders in millions base rate increase and transition charges pscr reduction regulatory assets stranded costs adjustment regulatory asset deferrals cessation pre tax income decrease net income decrease we ceased recording regulatory assets for costs that are reflected in rates pursuant to the mpsc s rate orders 
see note for a further discussion of the mpsc s interim and final rate orders 
gas interim rate order in september  michcon filed an application with the mpsc for an increase in service and distribution charges base rates for its gas sales and transportation customers 
the filing requested an overall increase in base rates of million annually approximately increase  inclusive of gas costs  beginning january  in september  michcon received an interim order in this rate case authorizing an increase in base rates of million annually  effective september  the interim rate order increased earnings by approximately million in michcon expects a final order from the mpsc in the first quarter of 
table of contents operating costs during  we experienced increases in operation and maintenance costs  primarily within our electric and gas utilities 
the increases were driven by higher costs associated with pension and postretirement benefits and uncollectible accounts receivable 
pension and postretirement benefits expense totaled million in  compared to million in the increase is due to financial market performance  lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates 
we have made modifications to the pension and postretirement benefit plans to mitigate the earnings impact of higher costs 
additionally  the recoverability of pension and health care benefits costs were part of our electric and gas rate filings 
the mpsc approved a pension tracking mechanism in detroit edison s final rate order that provides for the recovery or refunding of pension costs above or below the amount reflected in base rates 
the mpsc also required detroit edison to propose a similar tracking mechanism for retiree health care costs 
detroit edison filed a request with the mpsc in february seeking authority to implement a tracking mechanism for retiree health care costs 
both utilities continue to experience high levels of past due receivables  especially within our energy gas operations 
the increase is attributable to economic conditions  high natural gas prices and the lack of adequate levels of assistance for low income customers 
as a result of these factors  our allowance for doubtful accounts expense for the two utilities increased to million in compared to million for the corresponding period 
we are taking aggressive actions to reduce the level of past due receivables  including customer disconnections  contracting with collection agencies and working with the state of michigan and others to increase the share of low income funding allocated to our customers 
in michcon s current gas rate filing  we addressed numerous operating cost issues  including uncollectible accounts receivable expense 
the mpsc staff supports a provision proposed by michcon that would allow michcon to recover or refund of uncollectible accounts receivable expense above or below the amount that is reflected in base rates 
we support the mpsc staff s recommendation and believe the provision would significantly reduce our risk of high uncollectible gas accounts receivable 
to partially address this issue of rising costs  we continue to employ the dte energy operating system  which is the application of tools and practices to obtain operating efficiencies and enhance operating performance 
we are targeting over million in savings during through the application of operating system principles 
weather earnings in our electric and gas utilities are seasonal and sensitive to weather 
electric utility earnings are dependent on hot summer weather  while the gas utility s results are driven by cold winter weather 
we experienced both milder summer and winter weather during  which negatively impacted sales demand 
the lower demand reduced current year earnings by million compared to additionally  we occasionally experience various types of storms that damage our electric distribution infrastructure resulting in power outages 
the impact of storms on our current year earnings was significantly lower than in  which was affected by several catastrophic wind and ice storms  as well as by the august blackout 
restoration and other costs associated with storm related power outages lowered pretax earnings by million compared to million in synthetic fuel operations we operate nine synthetic fuel production plants at eight locations 
since  we have sold majority interests in eight of the nine plants  representing approximately of our total production capacity 
synfuel facilities chemically change coal  including waste and marginal coal  into a synthetic fuel as determined under applicable internal revenue service irs rules 
section of the internal revenue code provides tax credits for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from coal 
synfuel related tax credits expire in december operating expenses associated with synfuel projects exceed operating revenues and therefore generate operating losses  which have been more than offset by the resulting section tax credits 
in order to 
table of contents recognize section tax credits  a taxpayer must have sufficient taxable income in the year the tax credit is generated 
once earned  the tax credits are utilized subject to certain limitations but can be carried forward indefinitely 
we have not had sufficient taxable income to fully utilize tax credits earned in prior periods 
as of december  we had million in tax credit carry forwards 
in order to optimize income and cash flow from our synfuel operations  we have sold majority interests in eight of our nine facilities and intend to sell a majority interest in the remaining plant during  representing of our production capacity 
when we sell an interest in a synfuel project  we recognize the gain from such sale as the facility produces and sells synfuel and when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
gain recognition is dependent on the synfuel production qualifying for section tax credits and the value of such credits as subsequently discussed 
in substance  we are receiving synfuel gains and reduced operating losses in exchange for tax credits associated with the projects sold 
sales of interests in synfuel projects allow us to accelerate cash flow while maintaining a stable income base 
the value of a section tax credit can vary each year and is adjusted annually by an inflation factor as published by the irs in april of the following year 
additionally  the value of the tax credit in a given year is reduced if the reference price of oil within the year exceeds a threshold price and is eliminated entirely if the reference price exceeds a phase out price 
the reference price of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the annual average wellhead price per barrel for domestic crude oil  which in recent years has been lower than the new york mercantile exchange nymex price for light  sweet crude oil 
the actual or estimated reference price and beginning and ending phase out prices per barrel of oil for  and are as follows beginning phase out ending phase out reference price price price actual estimated estimated not available numerous recent events have significantly increased domestic crude oil prices  including terrorism  storm related supply disruptions and strong worldwide demand 
as of february   the nymex closing price of a barrel of oil to be delivered in march was  which is comparable to a reference price assuming that such price was to continue for an entire year 
for and later years  if the reference price falls within or exceeds the phase out range  the availability of tax credits in that year would be reduced or eliminated  respectively 
as previously discussed  until the gain recognition criteria is met  gains from selling interests in synfuel facilities will be deferred 
it is possible that gains will be deferred in the first  second and or third quarters of each year until there is persuasive evidence that no tax credit phase out will occur for the applicable calendar year 
this could result in shifting earnings from earlier quarters to later quarters of a calendar year 
as discussed in notes and  we have entered into derivative and other contracts to economically hedge approximately of our synfuel cash flow exposure related to the risk of an increase in oil prices 
we are continuing to evaluate the current volatility in oil prices and alternatives available to mitigate our unhedged exposure to oil prices as part of our synfuel related risk management strategy 
assuming no synfuel tax credit phase out in future years  we expect cash flow from our synfuel business to total approximately billion between and the source of synfuel cash flow includes cash from operations  asset sales  and the utilization of section tax credits carried forward from synfuel production prior to non utility growth during  we continued to experience growth in our non utility businesses with income reaching million compared to million in the improvement primarily reflects increased contributions in our energy marketing trading segment  primarily due to a one time contract gain 
additionally  non utility growth in is attributable to increased earnings from our synfuels  coke 
table of contents batteries and on site energy projects 
also affecting the year over year comparison are asset gains  losses and impairments during and as subsequently discussed 
outlook we made significant progress during the past year on our corporate priorities  which included successful rate case outcomes  addressing structural issues with the electric customer choice program  continuing sell down of synfuel portfolio  continuing non utility growth momentum  and maintaining cash and balance sheet strength 
our long term strategy has not changed and in we will focus on maintaining a strong utility base  pursuing a unique growth strategy focused on value creation in targeted markets  maintaining a strong balance sheet and paying an attractive dividend 
the impact of the rate orders is expected to increase utility earnings in and as rate caps expire 
our financial performance will be dependent on successfully redeploying an expected billion of cash flow through  primarily associated with proceeds from the sale of interests in synfuel facilities 
our objective for cash redeployment is to strengthen the balance sheet and coverage ratios  as well as replace the value of synfuels that is currently inherent in our share price 
we will first use our cash to reduce parent company debt 
secondly  we will continue to pursue growth investments that meet our strict risk return and value creation criteria 
lastly  share repurchases will be used to build share value if adequate investment opportunities are not available 
results of operations we had earnings of million in  or per diluted share  compared to earnings of million  or per diluted share in and earnings of million  or per diluted share in as subsequently discussed  the comparability of earnings was impacted by our two discontinued businesses  international transmission company and southern missouri gas company  and the adoption of two new accounting rules in excluding discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes  our earnings from continuing operations in were million  or per diluted share  compared to earnings of million  or per diluted share in and earnings of million  or per diluted share in the following sections provide a detailed discussion of our segments  operating performance and future outlook 
segment performance outlook through  we operated our businesses through three strategic business units energy resources  energy distribution and energy gas 
each business unit had utility and non utility operations 
the balance of our business consisted of corporate other 
this resulted in the following reportable segments 
in  we expect to realign our business units as discussed in note in millions  except per share data net income loss energy resources utility power generation non utility energy services energy marketing trading other total non utility energy distribution utility power distribution

net income energy resources utility power generation the power generation plants of detroit edison comprise our regulated power generation business 
detroit edison s numerous fossil plants  its hydroelectric pumped storage plant and its nuclear plant generate electricity 
the generated electricity  supplemented with purchased power  is sold principally throughout michigan and the midwest to residential  commercial  industrial and wholesale customers 
factors impacting income power generation earnings decreased million in and million in  compared to the prior year 
as subsequently discussed  these results primarily reflect reduced gross margins and increased operation and maintenance expenses 

table of contents in millions operating revenues fuel and purchased power gross margin operation and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes other than income operating income other income and deductions income tax provision net income operating income as a percent of operating revenues gross margins declined million during and million in the declines were due primarily to lost margins from retail customers choosing to purchase power from alternative suppliers under the electric customer choice program as well as reduced cooling demand resulting from mild summer weather 
as a result of electric customer choice penetration  detroit edison lost of retail sales in  compared to of such sales during the loss of retail sales under the electric customer choice program also resulted in lower purchase power requirements  as well as excess power capacity that was sold in the wholesale market 
under the interim and final rate orders previously discussed  revenues from selling excess power reduce the level of recoverable fuel and purchased power costs and therefore do not impact margins associated with uncapped customers 
the rate orders also lowered pscr revenues  which were partially offset by increased base rate and transition charge revenues 
weather in was milder than  resulting in lost margins of million 
weather in was also milder than the prior year  resulting in lost margins of million 
the decline in margins and revenues in was also due to the allocation of a smaller portion of detroit edison s billings to power generation 
bar chart operating revenues and fuel and purchased power costs decreased in and reflecting a per megawatt hour mwh decline in fuel and purchased power costs during and a 
per mwh decline during fuel and purchased power costs are a pass through with the reinstatement of the pscr in  and therefore do not affect margins or earnings associated with uncapped customers 
the decrease in fuel and purchased power costs is attributable to lower priced purchases and the use of a more favorable power supply mix driven by higher generation output 
the favorable mix is due to lower purchases  driven by lost sales under the electric customer choice program 
the comparison was also 
table of contents affected by higher costs associated with substitute power purchased to meet customer demand during the august blackout 
we were required to purchase additional power during the day period it took for our generation fleet to return to pre blackout capacity 
electric sales and use in thousands of mwh retail wholesale and other internal use and line loss power generated and purchased in thousands of mwh power plant generation fossil nuclear fermi purchased power system output average unit cost mwh generation purchased power overall average unit cost represents fuel costs associated with power plants 
includes amounts associated with hedging activities 
operation and maintenance expense increased million in and million in the increase reflects costs associated with maintaining our generation fleet  including costs of scheduled and forced plant outages 
additionally  the increase in is due to incremental costs associated with the implementation of our dte project  a company wide initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems  including finance  human resources  supply chain and work management 
operation and maintenance expense in both years includes higher employee pension and health care benefit costs due to financial market performance  discount rates and health care trend rates 
expenses in were also affected by million in costs associated with the august blackout 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million in and decreased million in the variations reflect the income effect of recording regulatory assets  which lowered depreciation and amortization expenses 
the regulatory asset deferrals totaled million in and million in  representing net stranded costs and other costs we believe are recoverable under pa other income and deductions expense increased million in and decreased million in the increase is primarily due to lower income associated with recording a return on regulatory assets  as well as costs associated with addressing the structural issues of pa the decrease is attributable to lower interest expenses and increased interest income 
interest expense reflects lower borrowing levels and rates  and interest income includes the accrual of carrying charges on environmental related regulatory assets 
outlook future operating results are expected to vary as a result of external factors such as regulatory proceedings  new legislation  changes in market prices of power  coal and gas  plant performance  changes in economic conditions  weather and the levels of customer participation in the electric customer choice program 

table of contents as previously discussed  we expect cash flows and operating performance will continue to be at risk due to the electric customer choice program until the issues associated with this program are addressed 
we will accrue as regulatory assets our unrecovered generation related fixed costs stranded costs due to electric customer choice that we believe are recoverable under michigan legislation and mpsc orders 
we have addressed certain issues of the electric customer choice program in our february rate restructuring proposal 
we cannot predict the outcome of these matters 
in conjunction with the sale of the transmission assets of itc in february  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc froze itc s transmission rates through december it is expected that annual rate adjustments pursuant to a formulistic pricing mechanism beginning in january will result in an estimated increase in detroit edison s transmission expense of million annually 
additionally  in a proceeding before the ferc  several midwest utilities seek to recover transmission revenues lost as a result of a ferc order modifying the pricing of transmission service in the midwest 
detroit edison estimates that its potential obligation as a result of this proceeding could be million per month from december through march and million per month from april through march detroit edison is expected to incur an additional million in for charges related to the implementation of midwest independent transmission operator s open market 
as previously discussed  detroit edison received rate orders in that allow for the recovery of increased transmission expenses through the pscr mechanism 
see note regulatory matters 
energy services energy services is comprised of coal based fuels  on site energy projects and non utility power generation 
coal based fuels operations include producing synthetic fuel from nine synfuel plants and producing coke from three coke battery plants 
the production of synthetic fuel from all of our synfuel plants and the production of coke from one of our coke batteries generate tax credits under section of the internal revenue code 
on site energy projects include pulverized coal injection  power generation  steam production  chilled water production  wastewater treatment and compressed air supply 
power generation owns and operates four gas fired peaking electric generating plants and manages and operates two additional gas fired power plants under contract 
additionally  power generation develops  operates and acquires coal and gas fired generation 
factors impacting income energy services earnings decreased million in and increased million in  compared to the prior year 
as subsequently discussed  these results primarily reflect higher gains recognized from selling majority interests in our synfuel plants  varying levels of section tax credits  a gain from contract termination  uncollectible accounts written off and losses on synfuel hedges 

table of contents in millions operating revenues coal based fuels on site energy projects power generation non utility operation and maintenance fuel and purchased power depreciation and amortization fuel and purchased power taxes other than income gain on sale of interests in synfuel projects operating income loss other income and deductions minority interest income taxes provision benefit section tax credits net income operating revenues increased million in and million in reflecting higher synfuel  coal and coke sales  as well as increased revenues from our on site energy projects 
the improvement in synfuel revenues results from increased production due to additional sales of project interests in and  reflecting our strategy to produce synfuel primarily from plants in which we had sold interests in order to optimize income and cash flow 
as previously discussed  operating expenses associated with synfuel projects exceed operating revenues and therefore generate operating losses  which have been more than offset by the resulting section tax credits 
when we sell an interest in a synfuel project  we recognize the gain from such sale as the facility produces and sells synfuel and when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds to the company have become fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
in substance  we are receiving synfuel gains and reduced operating losses in exchange for tax credits associated with the projects sold 
bar chart coal marketing revenues in have also been affected by our strategy to produce synfuel primarily from plants in which we had sold interests 
this strategy resulted in the reduction of synfuel production levels 
we were contractually obligated to supply coal to customers at certain sites that did not produce synfuel as a result of our current production strategy 
to meet our obligations to provide coal under long term contracts with customers  we acquired coal that was resold to customers 
the coal was sold at prices higher than the prices at which synfuel would have been sold to these customers 

table of contents revenues from coke sales were higher in  due to higher coke sales volumes combined with higher market prices  due to limited supplies of coke in the us revenues from on site energy projects increased in  reflecting the completion of new long term utility services contracts with a large automotive company and a large manufacturer of paper products 
revenues in include a million pre tax fee generated in conjunction with the development of a related energy project  of which was sold to an unaffiliated partner 
operation and maintenance expense increased million in and million in  reflecting costs associated with synfuel production and coke operations 
partially offsetting the higher synfuel operating costs in was the recording of insurance proceeds associated with an accident at one of our coke batteries 
operation and maintenance expense in was affected by a million pre tax gain from the termination of a tolling agreement at one of our generation facilities  substantially offset by the establishment of a million pre tax reserve for receivables associated with a large customer that filed for bankruptcy 
gains on sale of interests in synfuel projects increased million in and million in the improvements are due to additional sales of majority interests in our synfuel projects 
to hedge our exposure to the risk of an increase in oil prices that could reduce synfuel sales proceeds  we entered into derivative and other contracts covering approximately of our synfuel cash flow exposure 
the derivative contracts are accounted for under the mark to market method with changes in their fair value recorded as an adjustment to synfuel gains 
we recorded a mark to market loss during the fourth quarter  which reduced synfuel gains by million pre tax 
see note for further discussion 
minority interest increased million in and million in  reflecting our partners share of operating losses associated with synfuel operations 
the sale of interests in our synfuel facilities during and resulted in allocating a larger percentage of such losses to our partners 
income taxes increased million in and million in  reflecting higher taxable earnings and a decline in the level of section tax credits due to the sale of interests in synfuel facilities 
outlook energy services will continue leveraging its extensive energy related operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow the on site energy business 
we expect solid earnings from our on site energy business in as a result of executing long term utility services contracts in energy marketing trading energy marketing trading consists of the electric and gas marketing and trading operations of dte energy trading and coenergy 
dte energy trading focuses on physical power marketing and structured transactions  as well as the enhancement of returns from dte energy s power plants 
coenergy focuses on physical gas marketing and the optimization of dte energy s owned and contracted natural gas pipelines and gas storage capacity 
to this end  both companies enter into derivative financial instruments as part of their marketing and hedging strategies  including forwards  futures  swaps and option contracts 
most of the derivative financial instruments are accounted for under the mark to market method  which results in earnings recognition of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives 
factors impacting income energy marketing trading s earnings increased million in  consisting of a million improvement at dte energy trading and a million improvement at coenergy 
earnings increased million in  of which million was attributable to dte energy trading and million to coenergy 
dte energy trading s earnings improvement in and was primarily due to realized margins associated with short term physical trading and origination activities

unrealized margins include mark to market gains and losses on derivative contracts  net of gains and losses reclassified to realized 
see fair value of contracts section that follows 
proprietary trading represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take advantage of market price movements 
structured contracts represent the net unrealized effect of derivative transactions entered into with the intent to capture profits by originating substantially hedged positions with wholesale energy marketers  utilities  retail aggregators and alternative energy suppliers 
economic hedges represent the net unrealized effect of derivative activity associated with assets owned or contracted for by dte energy  including forward sales of gas production and trades associated with transportation and storage capacity 
gas in inventory margins represent gains associated with fair value accounting in coenergy changed its method of accounting for inventory in january note 
excludes the impact on margins from the modification of a transportation agreement with an interstate pipeline company 
coenergy s earnings in and were affected by varying gains and losses on economic hedge contracts related to storage assets 
as subsequently discussed in the outlook section  the unrealized gains and losses of economic hedge contracts are required to be recognized under mark to market accounting  while the offsetting unrealized losses and gains on the underlying asset positions are not recognized 
coenergy s earnings in reflect a million one time pre tax gain from modifying a future purchase commitment under a transportation agreement and terminating a related long term gas exchange storage agreement with an interstate pipeline company 
under the gas exchange agreement  we received gas from the customer during the summer injection period and redelivered the gas during the winter heating season 
the realized and unrealized margins comparison for both dte energy trading and coenergy was affected by our decision in late to monetize certain in the money derivative contracts while simultaneously entering into replacement at the market contracts 
the monetizations were completed in conjunction with implementing a series of initiatives to improve cash flow and fully utilize section tax 
table of contents credits 
although the monetizations did not impact earnings  they had the effect of decreasing realized margins and increasing unrealized margins on economic hedges in  and having the opposite effect on margins in outlook energy marketing trading will seek to manage its business in a manner consistent with  and complementary to  the growth of our other business segments 
gas storage and transportation capacity enhances our ability to provide reliable and custom tailored bundled services to large volume end users and utilities 
this capacity  coupled with the synergies from dte energy s other businesses  positions the segment to add value 
significant portions of the energy marketing trading portfolio are economically hedged 
the portfolio includes financial instruments and gas inventory  as well as owned and contracted natural gas pipelines and storage assets 
the financial instruments are deemed derivatives  whereas the gas inventory  pipelines and storage assets are not considered derivatives for accounting purposes 
as a result  energy marketing trading will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked to market without revaluing the underlying non derivative contracts and assets 
the majority of such earnings volatility is associated with the natural gas storage cycle  which runs annually from april of one year to march of the next year 
our strategy is to economically hedge the price risk of all gas purchases for storage with sales in the over the counter forwards and futures markets 
current accounting rules require the marking to market of forward sales and futures  but do not allow for the marking to market of the related gas inventory 
this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods 
we anticipate the financial impact of this timing difference will reverse by the end of each storage cycle 
see fair value of contracts section that follows 
non utility other our other non utility businesses include our coal services and biomass units 
coal services provides fuel  transportation and rail equipment management services 
we specialize in minimizing fuel costs and maximizing reliability of supply for energy intensive customers 
additionally  we participate in coal trading and coal to power tolling transactions  as well as the purchase and sale of emissions credits 
coal services has formed a subsidiary  dte peptec inc  which uses proprietary technology to produce high quality coal products from fine coal slurries typically discarded from coal mining operations 
biomass develops  owns and operates landfill recovery systems in the us gas produced from many of these landfill sites qualifies for section tax credits 
factors impacting income earnings increased million in and declined million in the increase reflects higher sales from coal and emissions credits  partially offset by increased costs associated with our waste coal operations 
the decline reflects reduced marketing and tolling income as well as an increase in operating costs associated with ramping up the dte peptec business 
our first waste coal facility in ohio became operational in late dollars in millions coal services tons of coal shipped in millions biomass gas produced in bcf tax credits generated dte energy s portion of total tax credits generated 
outlook we expect to continue to grow our coal services and biomass units 
we believe a substantial market could exist for the use of dte peptec inc technology and we continue to modify and prove out this technology 
coal services and biomass have formed a new subsidiary to enter the coal mine methane business 
we purchased coal mine methane assets in illinois at the end of  and expect to reconfigure equipment and restart operations by mid 
table of contents the section tax credits generated by biomass are subject to the same phase out risk if domestic crude oil prices reach certain levels  as detailed in the synthetic fuel operations discussion 
see note energy distribution utility power distribution power distribution operations include the electric distribution services of detroit edison 
power distribution distributes electricity generated and purchased by energy resources and alternative energy suppliers to detroit edison s million customers 
factors impacting income power distribution earnings increased million during and decreased million in  compared to the prior year 
as subsequently discussed  these results primarily reflect varying operating revenues and operation and maintenance expenses as well as a non recurring loss recorded in in millions operating revenues fuel and purchased power operation and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes other than income operating income other income and deductions income tax provision net income operating income as a percent of operating revenues electric deliveries in thousands of mwh residential commercial industrial wholesale other electric choice electric choice self generations total electric deliveries represents deliveries for self generators who have purchased power from alternative energy suppliers to supplement their power requirements 
operating revenues increased million in  primarily due to an increase in base rates resulting from the interim and final rate orders 
the improvement is also attributable to residential sales growth and the allocation of a higher portion of detroit edison s billings to power distribution  partially offset by the effects of milder weather 
operating revenues decreased million in  reflecting mild summer weather and the impact of slower economic conditions 
operation and maintenance expense decreased million in and increased million in the operation and maintenance expense comparability was affected by restoration costs associated with three catastrophic storms and the august blackout 
both years were also affected by an increase in 
table of contents reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable  reflecting high past due amounts attributable to economic conditions  and an increase in employee benefit costs 
additionally  the comparisons were affected by incremental costs associated with our dte project implementation  a million pre tax loss in from the sale of our steam heating business  and the accrual of refunds in and associated with transmission services 
bar chart outlook operating results are expected to vary as a result of external factors such as weather  changes in economic conditions and the severity and frequency of storms 
we experienced numerous catastrophic storms over the past few years 
the effect of the storms on annual earnings was partially offset by storm insurance 
we have been unable to obtain storm insurance at economical rates and as a result  we do not anticipate having insurance coverage at levels that would significantly offset unplanned expenses from ice storms  tornadoes  or high winds that damage our distribution infrastructure 
non utility non utility energy distribution operations consist of dte energy technologies  which assembles  markets  distributes and services distributed generation products  provides application engineering  and monitors and manages on site generation system operations 
factors impacting income non utility results declined million in and improved million in the decrease includes an impairment charge for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of an investment in a joint venture that supplied certain distributed generation equipment and materials to dte energy technologies 
outlook dte energy technologies will focus on sales of proprietary pre engineered and packaged continuous generation products in key applications 
this will likely result in near term revenue decline  but we anticipate gross profit margins will improve 
combined with continuing cost reductions and resumption of sales growth  we believe these actions will lead to improved financial performance in 
table of contents energy gas utility gas distribution gas distribution operations include gas distribution services primarily provided by michcon  our gas utility that purchases  stores  distributes and sells natural gas to million residential  commercial and industrial customers located throughout michigan 
factors impacting income gas distribution s earnings declined million in and million in  compared to the prior year 
as subsequently discussed  results primarily reflect varying gross margins  higher operation and maintenance expenses and a non recurring loss recorded in in millions operating revenues cost of gas gross margins operation and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes other than income operating income other income and deductions income tax provision benefit net income operating income as a percent of operating revenues gross margins increased million in and decreased million in  compared to the prior year

partially offsetting these improvements were lower sales and end user transportation deliveries due to milder weather 
the gross margin comparison was also affected by a million pre tax reserve recorded in for the potential disallowance in gas costs pursuant to an mpsc order in michcon s gas cost recovery gcr plan case note

table of contents operation and maintenance expense increased million in and million in  reflecting higher reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and pension and health care costs 
the increase in uncollectible accounts expense reflects high past due amounts attributable to an increase in gas prices  continued weak economic conditions and a lack of adequate public assistance for low income customers 
bar chart other income and deductions expense increased million in and decreased million in  reflecting a gain on sale of interests in a series of real estate partnerships 
income taxes in and were impacted by lower earnings and favorably affected by an increase in the amortization of tax benefits previously deferred in accordance with mpsc regulations 
outlook operating results are expected to vary as a result of external factors such as regulatory proceedings  weather and changes in economic conditions 
higher gas prices and economic conditions have resulted in an increase in past due receivables 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates 
however  failure to make continued progress in collecting past due receivables would unfavorably affect operating results 
energy assistance programs funded by the federal government and the state of michigan remain critical to michcon s ability to control uncollectible accounts receivable expenses 
we are working with the state of michigan and others to increase the share of funding allocated to our customers to be representative of the number of low income individuals in our service territory 
as a result of the continued increase in operating costs  michcon filed a rate case in september to increase rates by million annually to address future operating costs and other issues 
michcon received an interim order in this rate case in september increasing rates by million annually 
the mpsc staff has recommended a provision that would allow michcon to recover or refund of uncollectible accounts receivable expense above or below the amount that is reflected in base rates 
see note regulatory matters 
non utility non utility operations include the gas production business and the gas storage  pipelines processing business 
our gas production business produces gas from proven reserves in northern michigan and sells the gas to the energy marketing trading segment 
gas storage  pipelines processing has a partnership interest in an interstate transmission pipeline  seven carbon dioxide processing facilities and a natural gas storage field  as well as lease rights to another natural gas storage field 
the assets of these businesses are well integrated with other dte energy entities 
factors impacting income earnings decreased million in and increased million in the decline in is due to gains recorded in from selling our pipeline interest in the portland natural gas transmission system  as well as from selling certain gas properties 
excluding those gains  income increased million reflecting the acquisition of an additional ownership in the vector 
table of contents pipeline in late  increased sales of transportation capacity by vector pipeline and increased storage sales throughout outlook we anticipate further expansion of our storage facilities and vector pipeline to take advantage of available growth opportunities 
we are also seeking to secure markets for our interest in the millennium pipeline 
we expect to continue developing our gas production properties in northern michigan and leverage our experience in this area by pursuing investment opportunities in unconventional gas production outside of michigan 
during  we acquired approximately  leasehold acres in the southern region of the barnett shale in texas  an area of increasing production 
we began drilling test wells in december and anticipate drilling a significant number of additional test wells in the first half of initial results from the test wells are expected in mid if the results are successful  we could commit up to million of capital over the next several years to develop these properties 
corporate other corporate other includes various corporate support functions such as accounting  legal and information technology 
as these functions essentially support the entire company  their costs are fully allocated to the various segments based on services utilized and therefore the effect of the allocation on each segment can vary from year to year 
additionally  corporate other holds certain non utility debt and investments  including assets held for sale and in emerging energy technologies 
factors impacting income corporate other results improved million in  compared to a million decline in the improvement was affected by a million net of tax gain from the sale of million shares of plug power stock note  as well as lower michigan single business taxes  resulting from tax saving initiatives

under us generally accepted accounting principles  we classified smgc as a discontinued operation in and recognized a net of tax impairment loss of approximately million  representing the write down to fair value of the assets of smgc  less costs to sell  and the write off of allocated goodwill 
in november  we entered into a definitive agreement providing for the sale of smgc 
following receipt of regulatory approvals and resolution of other contingencies  it is anticipated that the transaction will close in international transmission company in february  we sold itc  our electric transmission business  to affiliates of kohlberg kravis roberts co 
and trimaran capital partners  llc 
accordingly  we classified itc as a discontinued operation 
the sale generated a preliminary net of tax gain of million in the gain was net of transaction costs  the portion of the gain that was refundable to customers and the write off of approximately million of allocated goodwill 
the gain was lowered to million in under the mpsc s november final rate order that resulted in a revision of the applicable transaction costs and customer refund

capital resources and liquidity dte energy and its subsidiaries require cash to operate and cash is provided by both internally and externally generated sources 
we manage our liquidity and capital resources to maintain financial flexibility to meet our current and future cash flow needs 
cash requirements we use cash to maintain and expand our electric and gas utilities and to grow our non utility businesses  in addition to retiring and paying interest on long term debt and paying dividends 
our strategic direction anticipates base level capital investments and expenditures for existing businesses in of up to billion 
the capital needs of our utilities will increase due primarily to environmental related expenditures 
capital spending for general corporate purposes will increase in  primarily as a result of dte and environmental spending 
we began implementing the dte project in the company expects the project to incrementally cost approximately million to million 
the epa ozone transport regulations and final new air quality standards relating to ozone and particulate air pollution will continue to impact us 
detroit edison estimates that it will spend approximately million in and incur up to an additional billion of future capital expenditures over the next five to eight years to satisfy both existing and proposed new control requirements 
the full recovery of million of environmental expenditures was authorized in the mpsc s november final rate order 
non utility capital spending will approximate million to million annually for the next several years 
capital spending for growth of existing or new businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet our strict risk return and value creation criteria 
debt maturing in  excluding securitization debt  totals approximately million 
we believe that we will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital requirements

our non utility businesses also provide sources of cash flow to the enterprise and reflect a range of operating profiles 
the profiles vary from our synthetic fuels business  which we believe will provide over billion in cash through  to new start ups 
these new start ups include our unconventional gas and waste coal recovery businesses  which we are growing and  if successful  could require significant investments 
although dte energy s overall earnings were million in  cash from operations totaling million was up million from the comparable period 
the operating cash flow comparison reflects an increase of over million in net income  after adjusting for non cash items depreciation  depletion  amortization  deferred taxes and gains  substantially offset by a million increase in working capital and other requirements 
a portion of this improvement is attributable to the change in our strategy to primarily produce synfuel from plants in which we have sold interests 
as previously discussed  synfuel projects generate operating losses  which have been more than offset by tax credits that we have been unable to fully utilize  thereby negatively affecting operating cash flow 
cash for working capital primarily reflects higher income tax payments of million in  reflecting a different payment pattern of taxes in compared to the increase in working capital was mitigated by company initiatives to improve cash flow  including better inventory management  cash sales transactions  deferral of retirement plan contributions and the utilization of letters of credit 
certain cash initiatives in lowered cash flow in 
table of contents our net operating cash flow in was million  reflecting a million decline from the decrease was attributable to lower utility net income  after adjusting for non cash items 
partially offsetting the declines were lower working capital and other requirements reflecting company initiatives to improve cash flow and optimize synfuel operations 
the improvement in working capital was achieved despite a million contribution to our pension plans 
outlook we expect cash flow from operations to increase over the long term primarily due to improvements from utility rate increases and the sales of interests in our synfuel projects 
this will be partially offset by higher cash requirements  primarily within our gas storage business 
we are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow through cash improvement initiatives 
operating cash flow from our utilities is expected to increase in  but will be affected by the level of sales migration under the electric customer choice program and the ability of the mpsc within the regulatory processes to put in place a customer choice program that has sound economic fundamentals 
in addition  the customer choice program s impact will also be determined by the success of the company in addressing certain structural flaws within additional regulatory proceedings and the legislative process 
another factor affecting utility cash flows is the degree and timing of rate relief within the electric and gas rate cases 
based on the final and interim orders issued by the mpsc in  approximately million of additional revenues were realized in the calendar year 
due to the structure of the interim and final rate orders  we will not realize the full benefits of interim and final rate relief until when all customer rate caps expire 
improvements in cash flow from our utilities are also expected from better management of our working capital requirements  including the continued focus on reducing past due accounts receivable 
our emphasis in these businesses will continue to be centered around cash generation and conservation 
cash flows from our synfuel business are expected to total approximately billion between and the redeployment of this cash represents a unique opportunity to increase shareholder value and strengthen our balance sheet 
we expect to use this cash to reduce debt  to continue to pursue growth investments that meet our strict risk return and value creation criteria and to potentially repurchase common stock if adequate investment opportunities are not available 
our objectives for cash redeployment are to strengthen the balance sheet and coverage ratios in order to improve our current credit ratings and outlook  and to more than replace the value of synfuels 
cash flows from our synfuel business are expected to approximate million in the source of synfuel cash flow includes cash from operations excluding certain working capital changes  asset sales  and the utilization of section tax credits carried forward from synfuel production prior to our other operating non utility businesses are expected to contribute approximately million through remaining start up businesses such as unconventional gas production  waste coal recovery and distributed generation will continue to use cash in excess of their cash generation over the next couple of years while they are being further developed 
certain of the previously discussed cash initiatives resulted in accelerating the receipt of cash in  which will have the impact of lowering cash flow in cash from investing activities cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets 
in any given year  we will look to harvest cash from under performing or non strategic assets 
capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain our generation and distribution infrastructure  comply with environmental regulations and gas pipeline replacements 
capital spending within our non utility businesses is for ongoing maintenance and some expansion 
the balance of non utility spending is for growth  which we manage very carefully 
we look to make investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy  management skills  risks and returns 
all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis 
we have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will 
table of contents not make investments unless they meet our criteria 
for new business lines  we invest tentatively based on research and analysis 
based on a limited investment  we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results 
in any given year  the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of the company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings 
net cash relating to investing activities declined million in and improved billion in  compared to the prior year 
the changes were primarily due to proceeds received in totaling million from the sale of itc  interests in three synfuel projects and non strategic assets 
additionally  the changes are due to variations in cash contractually designated for debt service 
longer term  with the expected improvement at our utilities and continued cash generation from the synfuel business  cash flows are expected to improve 
we will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined fashion if we can find opportunities that meet our strategic  financial and risk criteria 
cash from financing activities we rely on both short term borrowings and longer term financings as a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied by the company s operations 
short term borrowings  which are mostly in the form of commercial paper borrowings  provide us with the liquidity needed on a daily basis 
our commercial paper program is supported by our unsecured credit facilities 
dte energy and its subsidiaries have a total of billion in credit facilities  which provide liquidity to our commercial paper programs and support the use of letters of credit 
in millions issuing entity facility amount maturity date dte energy dte energy dte energy detroit edison detroit edison michcon michcon borrowings under the facilities are available at prevailing short term interest rates

to at december  the companies are currently in compliance with these financial covenants 
should either detroit edison or michcon have delinquent debt obligations of at least million to any creditor  such delinquency will be considered a default under dte energy s credit agreements 
these agreements have standard material adverse change mac clauses  however  the agreements expiring in october include a provision that the mac clause does not apply when borrowings are made to repay maturing commercial paper 
additionally  detroit edison has a million short term financing agreement secured by customer accounts receivable 
the agreement contains certain covenants related to the delinquency of accounts receivable 
detroit edison is currently in compliance with these covenants 
for additional information see note short term credit arrangements and borrowings 

table of contents our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend as to fixed and variable interest rates and maturity 
we continually evaluate our leverage target  which is currently or lower  to ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating 
we have completed a number of refinancings with the effect of extending the average maturity of our long term debt and strengthening our balance sheet 
the extension of the average maturity was accomplished at interest rates that lowered our debt costs 
net cash used for financing activities improved million in and declined billion in  compared to the prior periods 
the change was primarily due to higher issuances of new long and short term debt and fewer repurchases of long term debt 
the change was due to higher redemptions of long term debt and lower proceeds from issuances of new debt and common stock 
for additional information on debt issuances and redemptions  see note long term debt and preferred securities 
amounts available under shelf registrations include million at dte energy and million at detroit edison 
michcon does not have current shelf capacity 
in  we plan on filing new shelf registration statements for michcon and detroit edison 
common stock issuances or repurchases can also be a source or use of cash 
in january  we announced the dte energy board has authorized the repurchase of up to million in common stock through the authorization provides company management with flexibility to pursue share repurchases from time to time  and will depend on future cash flows and investment opportunities 
in january  we discontinued issuing new dte energy shares for our dividend reinvestment plan  which generated approximately million annually 
we also contributed million of dte energy common stock to our pension plan in the first quarter of contractual obligations the following table details our contractual obligations for debt redemptions  leases  purchase obligations and other long term obligations as of december  less in millions than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt mortgage bonds  notes other securitization bonds equity linked securities trust preferred linked securities capital lease obligations interest operating leases electric  gas  fuel  transportation storage purchase obligations other long term obligations total obligations excludes amounts associated with full requirements contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required 
credit ratings credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
management believes that the current credit ratings of the company provide sufficient access to the capital markets 
however  disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to dte 
table of contents energy may affect the company s ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 
in november  moody s investors service and fitch ratings downgraded michcon 
in december  standard poor s downgraded dte energy  detroit edison and michcon 
the ratings reflect weaker credit metrics due to decreased cash flows mainly stemming from increased operation and maintenance costs without sufficient regulatory relief 
additional unfavorable changes in our ratings could restrict our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates and increase our borrowing costs 
we have issued guarantees for the benefit of various non utility subsidiaries 
in the event that our credit rating is downgraded to below investment grade  certain of these guarantees would require us to post cash or letters of credit valued at approximately million at december  additionally  our trading business could be required to restrict operations and our access to the short term commercial paper market could be restricted or eliminated 
while we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade  we cannot predict the outcome of current or future reviews

such estimates relate to regulation  risk management and trading activities  section tax credits  goodwill  pension and postretirement costs  the allowance for doubtful accounts  and legal and tax reserves 
regulation a significant portion of our business is subject to regulation 
detroit edison and michcon currently meet the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
application of this standard results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and non regulated businesses 
sfas no 
requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non regulated businesses 
future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in discontinuing the application of sfas no 
for some or all of our businesses 
if we were to discontinue the application of sfas no 
on all our operations  we estimate that the extraordinary loss would be as follows

derivative contracts are only marked to market to the extent that markets are considered highly liquid where objective  transparent prices can be obtained 
unrealized gains and losses are fully reserved for transactions that do not meet this criterion 
section tax credits we generate section tax credits from our synfuel  coke battery and biomass operations 
we recognize earnings as tax credits are generated at our facilities in one of two ways 
first  to the extent we generate credits to our own account  we recognize earnings through reduced tax expense 
second  to the extent we have sold an interest in our synfuel facilities to third parties  we recognize gains as synfuel is produced and sold  and when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
all section tax credits taken after are subject to audit by the irs  however  all of our synthetic fuel facilities have received favorable private letter rulings from the irs with respect to their operations 
audits of four of our synfuel facilities for the years and were successfully completed during one synfuel facility is currently under audit 
if our section tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit  there could be a significant write off of previously recorded earnings from such tax credits 

table of contents tax credits generated by our facilities were million in  as compared to million in and million in the portion of tax credits generated for our own account were million in  as compared to million in and million in  with the remaining credits generated allocated to third party partners 
outside firms assist us in assuring we operate in accordance with our private letter rulings and within the parameters of the law  as well as calculating the value of tax credits 
goodwill certain of our business units have goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations notes and 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  each of our reporting units with goodwill is required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired 
in order to perform these impairment tests  we must determine the reporting unit s fair value using valuation techniques  which use estimates of discounted future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit 
these cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance 
to the extent estimated cash flows are revised downward  the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill  which would adversely impact our earnings 
as of december   our goodwill totaled billion 
the majority of our goodwill is allocated to our utility reporting units  with approximately million allocated to the utility energy gas reporting unit 
the value of the utility reporting units is significantly impacted by rate orders and the regulatory environment 
the utility energy gas reporting unit is comprised primarily of michcon 
we have made certain cash flow assumptions for michcon that are dependent upon the successful outcome of the outstanding gas rate case note 
these assumptions may change when we receive a final rate order  which is expected during the first quarter of based on our goodwill impairment test  we determined that the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying value and no impairment existed 
we will continue to monitor regulatory events  and evaluate their impact on our valuation assumptions and the carrying value of the related goodwill 
while we believe our assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ from our projections 
pension and postretirement costs our costs of providing pension and postretirement benefits are dependent upon a number of factors  including rates of return on plan assets  the discount rate  the rate of increase in health care costs and the amount and timing of plan sponsor contributions 
we had pension costs for qualified pension plans of million in  million in  and pension income of million in postretirement benefits costs for all plans were million in  million in  and million in pension and postretirement benefits costs for is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on our plan assets of 
in developing our expected long term rate of return assumption  we evaluated input from our consultants  including their review of asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions 
projected returns are based on broad equity and bond markets 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of in equity markets  in fixed income markets  and invested in other assets 
because of market volatility  we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate 
given market conditions  we believe is a reasonable long term rate of return on our plan assets 
we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions  including our expected rate of return  at least annually 
we base our determination of the expected return on qualified plan assets on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic manner over a three year period 
because of this method  the future value of assets 
table of contents will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
we have unrecognized net gains due to the recent favorable performance of the financial markets 
as of december   we had million of cumulative gains that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from at december  to at december  due to recent financial market performance  lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates  we estimate that our pension costs will approximate million compared to million in and our postretirement benefit costs will approximate million compared to million in in the last several years we have made modifications to the pension and postretirement benefit plans to mitigate the earnings impact of higher costs 
future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design 
additionally  future pension costs for detroit edison will be affected by a pension tracking mechanism  which was authorized by the mpsc in its november rate order 
the tracking mechanism provides for the recovery or refunding of pension costs above or below the amount reflected in detroit edison s base rates 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by would have increased our qualified pension costs by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by would have increased our pension costs for by approximately million 
lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by would have decreased our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for by approximately million 
the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets has been affected by the financial markets 
the value of our plan assets increased from billion at december  to billion at december  the value at december  increased to billion 
the investment performance returns and declining discount rates required us to recognize an additional minimum pension liability  an intangible asset and an entry to other comprehensive loss shareholders equity at december  and the additional minimum pension liability and related accounting entries will be reversed on the balance sheet in future periods if the fair value of plan assets exceeds the accumulated pension benefit obligations 
the recording of the minimum pension liability does not affect net income or cash flow 
pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without substantial returns in the financial markets 
we made a million cash contribution to the pension plan in  a million cash contribution in and a million contribution to our pension plan in the form of dte energy common stock in we also contributed million to the postretirement plans in and contributed million to the postretirement plans in we did not contribute to the postretirement plans in we do not anticipate making a contribution to our qualified pension plans in at the discretion of management  we anticipate making a to million contribution to our postretirement plans in in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act was signed into law 
this act provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law 
the effects of the subsidy on the measurement of net periodic postretirement benefit costs reduced costs by million in see note retirement benefits and trusteed assets for a further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefit plans 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends  economic conditions  age of receivables and other information 
higher customer bills due to increased gas prices  the lack of adequate levels of assistance for low income customers and economic conditions have also contributed to the increase in past due receivables 
as a result of these factors  our allowance for doubtful accounts increased in and we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates 
however  failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables would unfavorably affect operating results and cash flow 
legal and tax reserves we are involved in legal and tax proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
we regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters  and establish reserves when appropriate 
legal reserves are based upon management s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings against the company 
tax reserves are based upon management s assessment of potential adjustments to tax positions taken 
we regularly review ongoing tax audits and prior audit experience  in addition to current tax and accounting authority in assessing potential adjustments 
environmental matters protecting the environment  as well as correcting past environmental damage  continues to be a focus of state and federal regulators 
legislation and or rulemaking could further impact the electric utility industry including detroit edison 
the environmental protection agency epa and the michigan department of environmental quality have aggressive programs to clean up contaminated property 
air the epa ozone transport and acid rain regulations and final new air quality standards relating to ozone and particulate air pollution will continue to impact us 
detroit edison has spent approximately million through december and estimates that it will spend up to million in detroit edison estimates it will incur from million to billion of additional future capital expenditures over the next five to eight years to satisfy both existing and proposed new control requirements 
recovery of costs to be incurred through december was provided for in our november electric rate order 
see note regulatory matters 
the epa has initiated enforcement actions against several major electric utilities citing violations of the clean air act  asserting that older  coal fired power plants have been modified in ways that would require them to comply with the more restrictive new source provisions of the clean air act 
detroit edison received and responded to information requests from the epa on this subject 
the epa has not initiated proceedings against detroit edison 
the united states district court for the southern district of ohio eastern division issued a decision in august finding ohio edison company in violation of the new source provisions of the clean air act 
if the court s decision is upheld  the electric utility industry could be required to invest substantial amounts on pollution control equipment 
during the same month  however  a district court in a different division rendered a conflicting decision on the matter 
on october   the epa promulgated new rules  effective december   allowing repair  replacement or upgrade of production equipment without triggering source requirement controls if the cost of the parts and repairs do not exceed of the replacement value of the equipment being upgraded 
such repairs will be considered routine maintenance  however any changes in emissions would be subject to existing pollution permit limits and other state and federal programs for pollutants 
several states and environmental organizations have challenged these regulations and  on december   were granted a stay until the us court of appeals us circuit hears the arguments on the case 
we cannot predict the future impact of this issue upon detroit edison 
water in july  the epa published final regulations establishing performance standards for reducing fish loss at existing power plant cooling water intake structures 
these regulations require individual facility studies  and possible intake modifications that will be determined and implemented 
table of contents over the next five to seven years 
it is estimated that we will incur up to million in additional capital expenditures for detroit edison 
contaminated sites dte enterprises inc michcon and citizens owns  or previously owned  former manufactured gas plant mgp sites 
during the mid s  enterprises conducted preliminary environmental investigations at former mgp sites  and some contamination related to the by products of gas manufacturing was discovered at each site 
enterprises employed outside consultants to evaluate remediation alternatives and associated costs for these sites 
as a result of these studies  enterprises accrued a liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of million 
at december   the reserve balance was million of which million was classified as current 
our current estimates indicate that the previously accrued amounts are adequate to cover the costs of required remedial actions 
detroit edison conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites  including two former mgp sites  the area surrounding an ash landfill and several underground and aboveground storage tank locations 
the findings of these investigations indicated that the estimated cost to remediate these sites is approximately million  which is expected to be incurred over the next several years 
as a result of the investigation  detroit edison accrued approximately million liability during dte energy operating system and dte during  we adopted the dte energy operating system  which is the application of tools and operating practices that have resulted in operating efficiencies  inventory reductions and improvements in technology systems  among other enhancements 
operation and maintenance expenses benefited from our company wide initiative to pursue cost efficiencies and enhance operating performance 
we expect continued cost containment efforts and process improvements 
in  we began the implementation of dte  a company wide initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems including  finance  human resources  supply chain and work management 
we expect to incrementally spend approximately million to million over the life of the project 
we expect the benefits to outweigh this investment primarily from lower costs  faster business cycles  repeatable and optimized processes  enhanced internal controls  improvements in inventory management and reductions in system support costs 
we are in process of launching the first phase of our multi year dte project 
although our implementation plan includes detailed testing and contingency arrangements to ensure a smooth and successful transition  we can provide no assurance that complications will not arise that could interrupt our operations

fair value of contracts the following disclosures are voluntary and we believe provide enhanced transparency of the derivative activities and position of our energy trading marketing segment and our other businesses 
we use the criteria in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  to determine if certain contracts must be accounted for as derivative instruments 
the rules for determining whether a contract meets the criteria for derivative accounting are numerous and complex 
moreover  significant judgment is required to determine whether a contract requires derivative accounting  and similar contracts can sometimes be accounted for differently 
if a contract is accounted for as a derivative instrument  it is recorded in the 
table of contents financial statements as assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activity  at the fair value of the contract 
the recorded fair value of the contract is then adjusted quarterly to reflect any change in the fair value of the contract  a practice known as mark to market mtm accounting 
fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction 
to determine the fair value of contracts that are accounted for as derivative instruments  we use a combination of quoted market prices and mathematical valuation models 
valuation models require various inputs  including forward prices  volatility  interest rates  and exercise periods 
contracts we typically classify as derivative instruments are power and gas forwards  futures  options and swaps  as well as foreign currency contracts 
items we do not generally account for as derivatives and which are therefore excluded from the following tables include gas inventory  gas storage and transportation arrangements  full requirements power contracts and gas and oil reserves 
as subsequently discussed  we have fully reserved the value of derivative contracts beyond the liquid trading timeframe and which therefore do not impact income 
the subsequent tables contain the following four categories represented by their operating characteristics and key risks 
proprietary trading represents derivative activity transacted with the intent of taking a view  capturing market price changes  or putting capital at risk 
this activity is speculative in nature as opposed to hedging an existing exposure 
structured contracts represents derivative activity transacted with the intent to capture profits by originating substantially hedged positions with wholesale energy marketers  utilities  retail aggregators and alternative energy suppliers 
although transactions are generally executed with a buyer and seller simultaneously  some positions remain open until a suitable offsetting transaction can be executed 
economic hedges represents derivative activity associated with assets owned and contracted by dte energy  including forward sales of gas production and trades associated with owned transportation and storage capacity 
changes in the value of derivatives in this category economically offset changes in the value of underlying non derivative positions  which do not qualify for fair value accounting 
the difference in accounting treatment of derivatives in this category and the underlying non derivative positions can result in significant earnings volatility as discussed in more detail in the preceding results of operations section 
gas production represents derivative activity associated with our michigan gas reserves 
a substantial portion of the price risk associated with these reserves has been mitigated through changes in the value of the hedges are recorded as liabilities from risk management and trading with an offset in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedges are deemed effective 
the amounts shown in the following tables exclude the value of the underlying gas reserves and the changes therein

our intent is to recognize mtm activity only when pricing data is obtained from active quotes and published indexes 
actively quoted and published indexes include exchange traded ie  nymex and over the counter otc positions for which broker quotes are available 
the nymex has currently quoted prices for the next months 
although broker quotes for gas and power are generally available for and months into the future  respectively  we fully reserve all unrealized gains and losses related to periods beyond the liquid trading timeframe and which therefore do not impact income

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk dte energy has commodity price risk arising from market price fluctuations in conjunction with the anticipated purchase of electricity to meet its obligations during periods of peak demand 
we also are exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations on gas sale and purchase contracts  gas production and gas inventories 
to limit our exposure to commodity price fluctuations  we have entered into a series of electricity and gas futures  forwards  option and swap contracts 
commodity price risk associated with our electric and gas utilities is limited due to the pscr and gcr mechanisms note 
our energy services and biomass businesses are also subject to crude oil price risk 
as previously discussed  the section tax credits generated by dte energy s synfuel and biomass operations are subject to phase out if domestic crude oil prices reach certain levels 
see note financial and other derivative instruments for further discussion 
credit risk bankruptcies we purchase and sell electricity  gas  coal  coke and other energy products from and to numerous companies operating in the steel  automotive  energy  retail and other industries 
a number of customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
we have negotiated or are currently involved in negotiations with each of the companies  or their successor companies  that have filed for bankruptcy protection 
we regularly review contingent matters relating to purchase and sale contracts and record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss 
we believe our accrued amounts are adequate for probable losses 
the final resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements in the period they are resolved 
we engage in business with customers that are non investment grade 
we closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and  when deemed necessary  we request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations

interest rate risk dte energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt and preferred securities 
in order to manage interest costs  we use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements 
our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in us treasury rates  commercial paper rates and london inter bank offered rates libor 
as of december   the company has a floating rate debt to total debt ratio of approximately excluding securitized debt 
foreign currency risk dte energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts 
these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of power as well as for long term transportation capacity 
to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  we have entered into a series of currency forward contracts through summary of sensitivity analysis we performed a sensitivity analysis to calculate the fair values of our commodity contracts  long term debt instruments and foreign currency forward contracts 
the sensitivity analysis involved increasing and decreasing forward rates at december  by a hypothetical and calculating the resulting change in the fair values of the commodity  debt and foreign currency agreements
