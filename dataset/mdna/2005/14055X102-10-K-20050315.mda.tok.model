overview we are a specialized commercial finance company providing loans to small and medium sized businesses 
our goal is to be the lender of choice for small and medium sized businesses with annual revenues ranging from million to million that require customized and sophisticated debt financing 
we conduct our business in one reportable segment through three focused lending businesses corporate finance  which generally provides senior and mezzanine loans principally to businesses backed by private equity sponsors  healthcare and specialty finance  which generally provides asset based revolving lines of credit  first mortgage loans  equipment financing and other senior and mezzanine loans to healthcare businesses and a broad range of other companies  and structured finance  which generally provides asset based lending to finance companies and commercial real estate owners 
we offer a range of senior secured asset based loans  first mortgage loans  senior secured cash flow loans and mezzanine loans to our clients 
although we occasionally make loans greater than million  our loans generally range from million to million  with an average loan size as of december  of million  and generally have a maturity of two to five years 
substantially all of our loans require monthly interest payments at variable rates 
in many cases  our loans provide for interest rate floors that help us maintain our yields when interest rates are low or declining 
our revenue consists of interest and fees from our loans and  to a lesser extent  other income which includes unrealized appreciation depreciation on certain investments  gains losses on the sale of warrants and other investments  gains losses on derivatives  third party loan servicing income  income from fee generating business and deposits forfeited by our prospective borrowers 
our expenses consist principally of interest expense on our borrowings and operating expenses  which include compensation and employee benefits and other administrative expenses 
we borrow money from our lenders at variable interest rates 
we generally lend money at variable rates based on the prime rate 
to a large extent  our operating results and cash flow depend on the difference between the interest rate at which we borrow funds and the interest rate at which we lend these funds 
the primary driver of our results of operations and financial condition has been our significant growth since our inception on september  our interest earning assets  which consist primarily of loans  grew to billion as of december   an increase of  from billion as of december   and generated a gross yield of for the year ended december  we believe we have been able to manage our significant growth since inception without material adverse effects on the credit quality of our portfolio 
we have provided an allowance for loan losses consistent with our expectation of losses inherent in our portfolio 
as of december   loans with an aggregate principal balance of million were or more days delinquent 
as of december   loans with an aggregate principal balance of million were on non accrual status 
our business depends on our access to external sources of financing and the cost of such funds 
since inception  we have funded our business through a combination of secured credit facilities  secured term debt  convertible debt  equity and retained earnings 
the weighted average interest cost of our borrowings for the year ended december  was 
all of our term debt transactions have been accounted for as on balance sheet financings with no gain or loss recorded on the transactions 
as of december   our debt to equity ratio was x 
our ability to continue to grow depends to a large extent on our ability to continue to borrow from our lenders and our access to the debt capital markets 
to the extent these markets were to suffer from prolonged disruptions  our ability to finance continued growth could be hampered 
we believe that our capital structure and access to additional funding sources provide us with the flexibility to continue to grow our assets as we pursue attractive lending opportunities 
we accelerated our hiring and investments in other operational assets during our first years in operation and have continued to make these investments 
we believe our expenses generally will continue to decrease as a percentage of our average total assets as we continue to monitor our operating expenses and spread these expenses over a growing portfolio of loans 
for the year ended december   the ratio of our operating expenses to average total assets was  down from for the year ended december  during  short term interest rates rose  and we expect them to continue to rise 
increases in short term interest rates will have a positive impact on our net interest income as substantially all of our loans are at variable rates  while certain of our borrowings are at fixed rates 
however  with respect to our borrowers who generate cash flow in an amount that is only sufficient to service our debt  rising interest rates may adversely affect their ability to service our debt absent any improvements in their businesses 
we intend to closely monitor the effect of interest rate movements on our clients ability to make timely payments 
portfolio composition prior to february   our security alarm industry loans were included in our structured finance business and are reflected as such in the portfolio statistics below 
the composition of our loan portfolio by type and by lending business as of december  and was as follows december  in thousands composition of portfolio by loan type senior secured cash flow loans senior secured asset based loans first mortgage loans mezzanine loans total composition of portfolio by lending business corporate finance healthcare and specialty finance structured finance total the number of loans  average loan size  number of clients and average loan size per client by lending business as of december  were as follows number of average number average loan size loans loan size of clients per client in thousands composition of portfolio by lending business corporate finance healthcare and specialty finance structured finance overall portfolio the scheduled maturities of our loan portfolio by type as of december  were as follows due in due in one one year to five due after or less years five years total in thousands scheduled maturities by loan type senior secured cash flow loans senior secured asset based loans first mortgage loans mezzanine loans total the dollar amounts of all fixed rate and adjustable rate loans by loan type as of december  were as follows adjustable fixed rates rates total in thousands composition of portfolio by loan type senior secured cash flow loans senior secured asset based loans first mortgage loans mezzanine loans total percentage of total portfolio we also invest in equity interests  typically in connection with a loan to a client 
the investments include common stock  preferred stock  limited liability company interests  limited partnership interests and warrants to purchase equity instruments 
as of december  and  the carrying value of our investments was million and million  respectively 
as of december   investments totaling million are carried at fair value with increases and decreases recorded in other income expense 
as of december   we were committed to contribute million of additional capital to ten private equity funds 
interest and fee income interest and fee income represents loan interest and net fee income earned from our loan operations 
substantially all of our loans charge interest at variable rates that generally adjust daily 
fee income includes the amortization of loan origination fees  net of the direct costs of origination  the amortization of original issue discount  the amortization of the discount or premium on loans acquired  and other fees charged to borrowers 
loan prepayments may materially affect fee income since  in the period of prepayment  the amortization of remaining net loan origination fees and discounts is accelerated and prepayment penalties may be assessed on the prepaid loans 
interest expense interest expense is the amount paid on borrowings  including the amortization of deferred financing fees 
with the exception of our convertible debt  which pays a fixed rate  all of our borrowings charge interest at variable rates based on day libor or commercial paper rates plus a margin 
as our borrowings increase and as short term interest rates rise  our interest expense will increase 
deferred financing fees and the costs of acquiring debt  such as commitment fees and legal fees  are amortized over the shorter of either the first call period or the contractual maturity of the borrowing 
loan prepayments may materially affect interest expense since in the period of prepayment the amortization of remaining deferred financing fees and debt acquisition costs is accelerated 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the periodic cost of maintaining an appropriate allowance for loan losses inherent in our portfolio 
as the size of our portfolio increases  the mix of loans within our portfolio changes  or if the credit quality of the portfolio declines  we record a provision to increase the allowance for loan losses 
operating expenses operating expenses include compensation and benefits  professional fees  travel  rent  insurance  depreciation and amortization  marketing and other general and administrative expenses 
other income expense other income expense consists of gains losses on the sale of equity investments and warrants  unrealized appreciation depreciation on certain investments  gains losses on derivatives  due diligence deposits forfeited  fees associated with hud origination activities  third party servicing income  and other miscellaneous fees and expenses not attributable to our loan operations 
income taxes we were originally organized as a limited liability company 
during the period that we were organized as a limited liability company  all income taxes were the responsibility of our individual members  therefore  our historical consolidated statements of income do not include any provision for income taxes 
since our reorganization into a c corporation for income tax purposes in august  we are responsible for paying federal  state and local income taxes 
deferred tax liabilities and assets have been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book value and the tax basis of particular assets and liabilities  using tax rates scheduled to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
segment reporting statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  requires that a public business enterprise report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments including a measure of segment profit or loss  certain specific revenue and expense items  and segment assets 
we operate as a single business segment and  therefore  this statement is not applicable 
because our clients require customized and sophisticated debt financing  we have created three lending businesses to develop the industry experience required to structure loans that reflect the particular credit and security characteristics required by different types of clients 
however  we manage our operations as a whole rather than by lending business 
for example to date  our resources have been sufficient to support our entire lending business 
we obtain resources for the benefit of the entire company and do not allocate resources to specific lending businesses based on their individual or relative performance 
generally  we fund all of our loans from common funding sources 
we have established common loan origination  credit underwriting  credit approval and loan monitoring processes  which are used by all lending businesses 
we do not factor the identity of the lending business originating a loan into our decision as to whether to fund proposed loans 
rather  we fund every loan that is approved by our credit committee and is acceptable to our customers  and we expect this trend to continue 
results of operations our results of operations continue to be driven primarily by our rapid growth 
the most significant factors influencing our results of operations for the years ended december   and described in this section were significant growth in our loan portfolio  increased borrowings to fund our growth  increased operating expenses  consisting primarily of higher employee compensation directly related to increases in the number of employees necessary to originate and manage our loan portfolio  increased provision for loan losses as our portfolio continued to grow  and increased effective tax rate 
our operating results for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  and for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  were as follows year ended year ended december  december  change change change change in thousands interest income fee income interest expense provision for loan losses operating expenses other income income taxes  n a net income comparison of the years ended december  and interest income the increase in interest income was due to the growth in average interest earning assets  primarily loans  of billion  or  partially offset by a decrease in the interest component of yield of for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  fluctuations in yields are driven by a number of factors including the coupon on new originations  the coupon on loans that pay down or pay off and the effect of external interest rates 
fee income the increase in fee income was primarily due to two factors 
first  the recognition of greater prepayment fee income associated with the accelerated amortization of deferred net origination fees and loan discounts and prepayment fees which aggregated million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the remaining million increase in fee income was due to the overall growth in interest earning assets 
interest expense we fund our growth largely through borrowings 
consequently  the increase in our interest expense was primarily due to an increase in borrowings as well as rising interest rates during the year 
in  our borrowings increased billion  or 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in our cost of borrowings resulting from more cost effective financings 
net interest margin net interest margin  defined as net interest income divided by average interest earning assets  was for the year ended december   a decline of basis points from for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to the increase in interest expense resulting from higher leverage 
net interest spread  the difference between our gross yield on interest earning assets and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities  was for the year ended december   a decrease of basis points from for the year ended december  gross yield is the sum of interest and fee income divided by our average interest earning assets 
the decrease in net interest spread is attributable to the changes in its components as described above 
the yields of interest earning assets and the costs of interest bearing liabilities for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  interest and interest and weighted fee income average weighted fee income average average interest yield average interest yield balance expense cost balance expense cost in thousands interest earning assets interest income fee income total interest earning assets total interest bearing liabilities net interest spread net interest margin net yield on interest earning assets interest earning assets include loans  cash and restricted cash 
interest bearing liabilities include credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and repurchase agreements 
provision for loan losses the increase in the provision reflected the growth and the seasoning of the portfolio and an increase in the balance of impaired loans in the portfolio 
another factor contributing to the increase in the provision was the change in composition of our portfolio by loan type 
during  senior secured cash flow loans and mezzanine loans increased at a faster rate than the rest of our portfolio 
due to their higher risk profile  senior secured cash flow loans and mezzanine loans have a higher general reserve provision than the other loans in our portfolio 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded specific reserves of million and million  respectively  for loans which we considered to be impaired 
we consider a loan to be impaired when  based on current information  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  including principal and scheduled interest payments 
other income the decrease in other income for the year ended december  was primarily due to the decrease in gain on investments to million from million for the year ended december  due primarily to the gain on sale of our equity interest in medcap properties llc of million recognized in partially offsetting this decrease was the increase of million in fees arising from our activities in originating federally insured mortgage loans  the addition of million in third party servicing fees and an increase of million in diligence deposits forfeited 
operating expenses the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher total employee compensation  which increased million  or 
the higher employee compensation was attributable to the increase in employees during to as of december  from as of december   as well as higher incentive compensation relating to the growth in our operating profits 
a significant portion of employee compensation is composed of annual bonuses 
during  we established a variable methodology for employee bonuses partially based on the performance of the company  pursuant to which we accrued for employee bonuses throughout the year 
for the years ended december  and  bonus expense totaled million and million  respectively 
the remaining million increase in operating expenses for the year ended december  was attributable to an increase of million in professional fees  million in travel and entertainment expenses  million in rent  million in insurance and million in other general business expenses 
operating expenses as a percentage of average total assets decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  our efficiency ratio  which represents operating expenses as a percentage of our net interest and fee income and other income  decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the improvements in operating expenses as a percentage of average total assets and the efficiency ratio were attributable to controlling our operating expenses and spreading those expenses over a growing portfolio of loans 
the improvement in our efficiency ratio also partially resulted from the significant increase in our net interest and fee income 
income taxes we provided for income taxes on the income earned for the year ended december  based on a effective tax rate 
we provided for income taxes on the income earned from august  to december  based on a effective tax rate 
prior to our reorganization as a c corporation on august   we operated as a limited liability company and all income taxes were paid by the members 
at the reorganization date  we recorded a million net deferred tax asset and corresponding deferred tax benefit which lowered the effective tax rate 
since we were not a taxpayer prior to august  and due to the one time deferred tax benefit  our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was comparison of the years ended december  and interest income the increase in interest income was due to growth in average interest earning assets of billion  or  offset by a decline in the yield on average interest earning assets of basis points 
the decline in the yield on average interest earning assets was due primarily to overall declines in market interest rates 
fee income the increase in fee income was primarily due to the recognition of fee income associated with the accelerated amortization of deferred net origination fees and loan discounts and prepayment fees in the aggregate amount of million  for the year ended december  in addition  the accretion of loan discounts into fee income related to purchased loans contributed million in additional fee income for the year ended december  the remaining million increase in fee income was due to the overall growth in interest earning assets 
interest expense the increase was due to an increase in average borrowings of million  or  to fund growth in interest earning assets and an increase in our debt to equity ratio to x as of december  from x as of december  this increase was offset by a decrease in our cost of borrowings of basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease was a result of the falling interest rate environment during the year 
net interest margin net interest margin  defined as net interest income divided by average interest earning assets  was for the year ended december   a decline of basis points from for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest margin was due to an increase in our debt to equity ratio due to additional borrowings  partially offset by a decline in net interest spread 
net interest spread  the difference between our gross yield on interest earning assets and the total cost of our interest bearing liabilities  was for the year ended december   a decrease of basis points from for the year ended december  gross yield is the sum of interest and fee income divided by our average interest earning assets

we consider a loan to be impaired when  based on current information  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  including principal and scheduled interest payments 
we had no impaired loans during other income other income for the year ended december  included gains on investments of million compared with million as of december   an increase of million 
the increase in other income also was partially attributable to an increase of million in fees arising from our activities in originating federally insured mortgage loans and an increase of million in diligence deposits forfeited 
another component of the increase in other income was a million decrease in loss on derivatives to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating expenses contributing to the increase was higher employee compensation  which increased million  or 
the higher employee compensation was attributable to the increase in employees to as of december  from as of december   as well as higher incentive compensation relating to the growth in our operating profits 
a significant portion of the employee compensation is composed of annual bonuses  which we accrue throughout the year

we invest cash on hand in short term liquid investments 
we generally fund new loan originations and growth in revolving loan balances using advances under our credit facilities 
we had million and million of restricted cash as of december  and  respectively

our term and convertible debt are one time fundings that do not provide any ability for us to draw down additional amounts 
credit facilities we currently have four revolving credit facilities which we use to fund our loans on a daily basis 
our loans are held  or warehoused  in these facilities until we complete a term debt transaction in which we securitize a pool of loans from our credit facilities 
we use the proceeds from our term debt transactions to pay down our credit facilities which results in increased capacity to draw on them as needed 
availability under our credit facilities depends on our borrowing base  which is calculated based on the outstanding principal amount of eligible loans in each credit facility combined with specified portfolio concentration criteria

subject to certain conditions  we have the ability to repurchase or replace a loan held in our asset securitizations 
the expected maturity dates discussed in the preceding schedule are based upon the contractual maturity dates of the underlying loans  and assume a constant annual prepayment rate of and that there are no defaults or delinquencies on any of those loans 
if the loans have their maturities extended  experience defaults or delinquencies  or experience a prepayment rate of less than  the interest payments collected on the loans may be used to fund the interest reserve or to make principal payments on the notes 
the notes issued under each term debt transaction include accelerated amortization provisions that require cash flows to be applied first to fully pay the senior noteholders if the senior notes remain outstanding beyond the expected maturity dates 
if the accelerated amortization provisions are triggered  we would not receive cash flows from our retained junior notes until all the senior notes that have passed their expected maturity dates have been retired 
as of december   there were no defaults or delinquencies in the  and term debt transactions  and they had experienced prepayment rates of  and  respectively

repurchase agreement in august  we entered into a million master repurchase agreement with an affiliate of credit suisse first boston llc csfb to finance healthcare mortgage loans 
this repurchase agreement allows us to sell mortgage loans that we originate to csfb for a purchase price equal to of the outstanding principal balance of those mortgage loans  and to have the obligation to repurchase the loans no later than months after the sale 
as of december   we have not sold any mortgage loans to csfb under this repurchase agreement 
other liquidity additional liquidity is provided by our cash flow from operations 
for the years ended december   and  we generated cash flow from operations of million  million and million  respectively 
proceeds from our equity offerings  borrowings on our credit facilities and term loans  the issuance of asset backed notes in our term debt transactions and the issuance of convertible debt provide cash from financing activities 
for the years ended december   and  we generated cash flow from financing activities of billion  billion and million  respectively 
investing activities primarily relate to loan origination 
for the years ended december   and  we used cash in investing activities of billion  billion and million  respectively 
as of december   the amount of our unfunded commitments to extend credit to our clients exceeded our unused funding sources and unrestricted cash by million 
our obligation to fund unfunded commitments generally is based on our client s ability to provide additional collateral to secure the requested additional fundings  the additional collateral s satisfaction of eligibility requirements and our client s ability to meet certain other preconditions to borrowing 
provided our client s additional collateral meets all of the eligibility requirements of our funding sources  we believe that we have sufficient funding capacity to meet short term needs related to unfunded commitments 
if we do not have sufficient funding capacity to satisfy these commitments  our failure to satisfy our full contractual funding commitment to one or more of our clients could create breach of contract liability for us and damage our reputation in the marketplace  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we expect cash from operations  other sources of capital  including additional borrowings on existing and future credit facilities and term debt  to be adequate to support our projected needs for funding our existing loan commitments in the short term 
for the long term  the growth rate of our portfolio and other assets will determine our requirement for additional capital 
in addition to continuing to access the secured debt market for this capital  we will explore additional sources of financing 
these financings may include the general unsecured debt markets  equity related securities such as convertible debt  the issuance of common equity or other financing sources 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will have access to any of these funding sources in the future 
off balance sheet risk depending on the legal structure of the transaction  term debt securitizations may either be accounted for as off balance sheet with a gain or loss on the sale recorded in the statement of income or accounted for as on balance sheet financings 
all of our term debt transactions to date have been recorded as on balance sheet financings 
we are subject to off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business primarily from commitments to extend credit 
as of december  and  we had unfunded commitments to extend credit to our clients of billion and billion  respectively 
these commitments are subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance as the on balance sheet financial instruments we hold 
we use interest rate swap agreements to hedge fixed rate and prime rate loans pledged as collateral for our term debt 
our interest rate swap agreements modify our exposure to interest rate risk by converting fixed rate and prime rate loans to a day libor rate 
we enter into interest rate swaps to offset the basis swaps required by our term debt 
additionally  we use interest rate cap agreements to hedge loans with embedded interest rate caps that are pledged as collateral for our term debt 
our interest rate hedging activities partially protect us from the risk that interest collected under fixed rate and prime rate loans will not be sufficient to service the interest due under the day libor based term debt 
the fair market values of the interest rate swap agreements were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements was not significant as of december  and we are required to enter into interest rate swaps if we have more than million of fixed rate loans collateralizing our multi bank credit facility 
as of december   we had million of fixed rate loans collateralizing the facility 
therefore  as of december   we were not required to enter into fixed rate interest rate swaps 
we may make additional fixed rate loans in the future  which could require us to enter into new interest rate swap agreements 
for a detailed discussion of our derivatives and off balance sheet financial instruments  see note  derivatives and off balance sheet financial instruments  in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
contractual obligations in addition to our scheduled maturities on our credit facilities  term debt and convertible debt we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts 
we lease office space and office equipment under long term operating leases 
we have committed to purchase million of additional interests in ten private equity funds 
the expected contractual obligations under our credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt  operating leases  and commitments under non cancelable contracts as of december  were as follows credit convertible operating non cancelable facilities term debt debt leases contracts total in thousands thereafter total the contractual obligations for term debt are computed based on the contractual maturities of the underlying loans pledged as collateral and assume a constant prepayment rate of 
the underlying loans are subject to prepayment  which would shorten the life of the term debt transactions 
the underlying loans may be amended to extend their term  which will lengthen the life of the term debt transactions 
at our option  we may substitute new loans for prepaid loans up to specified limitations  which may also impact the life of the term debt transactions 
also  the contractual obligations for the term debt transaction are computed based on the initial call date 
the contractual obligations for convertible debt are computed based on the initial put call date 
the legal maturity of the convertible debt is for further discussion of terms of our convertible debt and factors impacting their maturity see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  borrowings  in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from the changes in the level of interest rates 
our net interest income is affected by changes in various short term interest rates  including day libor and the prime rate 
the majority of our loan portfolio bears interest at a spread to the prime rate with the remainder bearing interest at a fixed rate or at a spread to libor 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio bore interest at a fixed rate 
the interest rates on our borrowings are based on libor and commercial paper rates 
we attempt to mitigate exposure to the earnings impact of interest rate changes by lending and borrowing funds on a variable rate basis 
except as required by our various credit facilities and term debt as discussed above under off balance sheet risk  we do not engage in hedging activities because we have determined that the cost of hedging the risks associated with interest rate changes outweighs the risk reduction benefit 
the estimated changes in net interest income for a month period based on changes in the interest rates applied to our loan portfolio as of december  were as follows estimated increase in net interest income rate change over months basis points in thousands for the purposes of the above analysis  we excluded the impact of principal payments and assumed a advance rate on our variable rate borrowings 
as shown above  both reductions and increases in interest rates of basis points or more will result in increases in our net interest income 
approximately of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our loans had interest rate floors as of december  the loans with interest rate floors as of december  were as follows in thousands loans with contractual interest rates exceeding the interest rate floor at the interest rate floor below the interest rate floor loans with no interest rate floor total we also are exposed to changes in market values of our investments  many of which are carried at fair value 
as of december   and  investments totaled million  million and million  respectively  and mark to market adjustments on those investments totaled million  million and million  respectively 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of critical accounting policies  many of which require management to make estimates and assumptions 
the following describes the areas in which judgments are made by our management in the application of our accounting policies that significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations 
income recognition interest and fee income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
for amortizing term loans  original issue discounts and loan fees net of direct costs of origination are amortized into fee income using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the loan 
for revolving lines of credit and non amortizing term loans  original issue discounts and loan fees net of direct costs of origination are amortized into fee income using the straight line method over the contractual life of the loan 
fees due at maturity are recorded over the contractual life of the loan in accordance with our policy to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
if a loan is days or more past due  or we expect that the borrower will not be able to service its debt and other obligations  we will place the loan on non accrual status 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest and fees previously recognized as income but not yet paid are reversed and the recognition of interest and fee income on that loan will stop until factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist and the loan has been brought current 
we will make exceptions to this policy if the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
loan origination fees are deferred and amortized as adjustments to the related loan s yield over the contractual life of the loan 
in certain loan arrangements  we receive warrants or other investments from the client as additional origination fees 
the clients granting these interests typically are not publicly traded companies 
we record the investments received at estimated fair value as determined using various valuation models which attempt to estimate the underlying value of the associated entity 
these models are then applied to our ownership share factoring in any discounts for transfer restrictions or other terms which impact the value 
any resulting discount on the loan from recordation of warrant and other equity instruments are accreted into income over the term of the loan 
if our estimates of value of the investments received are not accurate  our income would be misstated 
allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan losses reflects the aggregate amount of our reserves we have recorded for the loans in our portfolio 
using a proprietary loan reserve matrix  we assign a reserve factor to each loan in the portfolio 
the reserve factor assigned dictates the percentage of the total outstanding loan balance that we reserve 
the actual determination of a given loan s reserve factor is a function of three elements the type of loan  for example  whether the loan is underwritten based on the borrower s assets  real estate or cash flow  whether the loan is senior or subordinated  and the internal credit rating assigned to the loan 
for example  riskier types of loans  such as cash flow loans  are assigned higher reserve factors than less risky loans such as asset based loans 
further  a subordinate loan would generally have a higher reserve factor than a senior loan  and loans with lower internal credit ratings would be assigned reserve factors higher than those with higher internal credit ratings 
we evaluate the internal credit ratings assigned to loans monthly to reflect the current credit risk of the borrower 
the reserve factors are primarily based on historical industry loss statistics adjusted for our own credit experience and economic conditions 
we also establish specific allowances for loan losses for impaired loans based on a comparison of the recorded carrying value of the loan to either the present value of the loan s expected cash flow  the loan s estimated market price or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
we charge off loans against the allowance when realization from the sale of the collateral or the enforcement of guarantees does not exceed the outstanding loan amount 
if our internal credit ratings  reserve factors  or specific allowances for loan losses are not accurate  our assets would be misstated 
valuation of investments with respect to investments in publicly traded equity interests  we use quoted market values to value investments 
with respect to investments in privately held equity interests  each investment is valued using industry valuation benchmarks  and then the value is assigned a discount reflecting the illiquid nature of the investment  as well as our minority  non control position 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  the pricing indicated by the external event will be used to corroborate our private equity valuation 
securities that are traded in the over the counter market or on a stock exchange generally will be valued at the prevailing bid price on the valuation date 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily ascertainable market value  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
a judgmental aspect of accounting for investments involves determining whether an other than temporary decline in value of the investment has been sustained 
if it has been determined that an investment recorded at cost has sustained an other than temporary decline in its value  the investment is written down to its fair value  by a charge to earnings  and a new cost basis for the investment is established 
term debt transactions periodically  we transfer pools of loans to special purpose entities for use in term debt transactions 
these on balance sheet term debt securitizations comprise a significant source of our overall funding  with the face amount of the outstanding loans assumed by third parties totaling billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
transfers of loans have not met the requirements of sfas no 
for sales treatment and are  therefore  treated as secured borrowings  with the transferred loans remaining in investments and the related liability recorded in borrowings 
if our judgments as to whether the term debt transactions met the requirements for on balance sheet financing were not appropriate  the accounting would be materially different with gains or losses recorded on the transfer of loans 
new accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified eitf issue no 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides a three step process for determining whether investments  including debt securities  are other than temporarily impaired and requires additional disclosures in annual financial statements 
the initial effective date of the recognition and measurement requirements in this standard was interim and annual periods beginning after june  the effective date of the disclosure requirements in this standard is effective for annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after june  in september  the fasb delayed the effective date indefinitely for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in eitf the disclosure guidance remains effective 
we do not anticipate that this accounting pronouncement will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the eitf of the fasb reached a final conclusion on eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share eitf 
the eitf concluded the common stock underlying contingent convertible debt instruments such as our convertible debentures should be included in diluted net income per share computations using the if converted method regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent feature has been met 
the eitf concluded that this new treatment should be applied retroactively  with the result that issuers of securities like our convertible debentures described in note of our audited consolidated financial statements would be required to restate previously issued diluted earnings per share 
in october  the fasb approved eitf and established an implementation date of december  under the terms of the indentures governing our convertible debentures  we have the ability to make irrevocable elections to pay the principal balance of the convertible debentures in cash upon any conversion prior to or at maturity 
by making these elections  under current interpretations of sfas no 
 earnings per share  and consistent with the provisions of eitf  convertible bonds with issuer option to settle for cash upon conversion  the common stock underlying the principal amount of the our convertible debentures would not be required to be included in our calculation of diluted net income per share and would have no past or future impact on our diluted net income per share 
the only impact on diluted net income per share from our convertible debentures would be from the application of the treasury stock method to any conversion spread on those instruments 
prior to the effective date of proposed sfas no 
revised  earnings per share  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 we intend to make such irrevocable elections for each series of our convertible debentures 
as a result  we do not anticipate the adoption of eitf will have any impact on our net income or diluted net income per share 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the effective date of this standard is interim and annual periods beginning after june  as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have an impact on our reported results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current guidance 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because it will depend on levels of future grants of share based payments  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was not significant 
on july   we plan to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method as described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
risk factors our business faces many risks 
the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer  and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
you should consider the following risks  together with all of the other information in this annual report on form k  before deciding to invest in our common stock 
risks related to our lending activities we may not recover the value of amounts that we lend 
we experienced charge offs of million for the year ended december  and expect to experience charge offs in the future 
a charge off occurs when all or part of the principal of a particular loan is no longer recoverable and will not be repaid 
as of december   we had an allowance for loan losses of million  including specific reserves of million for impaired loans  reflecting our judgment of the probable loan losses inherent in our portfolio 
if we were to experience material losses on our portfolio  they would have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our business and  to the extent the losses exceed our provision for loan losses  our revenues  net income and assets 
in addition  like other commercial finance companies  we have experienced missed and late payments  failures by clients to comply with operational and financial covenants in their loan agreements and client performance below that which we expected when we originated the loan 
any of the events described in the preceding sentence may be an indication that our risk of credit loss with respect to a particular loan has materially increased 
we make loans to privately owned small and medium sized companies  which present a greater risk of loss than loans to larger companies 
our portfolio consists primarily of commercial loans to small and medium sized  privately owned businesses with annual revenues ranging from million to million 
compared to larger  publicly owned firms  these companies generally have more limited access to capital and higher funding costs  may be in a weaker financial position and may need more capital to expand or compete 
these financial challenges may make it difficult for our clients to make scheduled payments of interest or principal on our loans 
accordingly  advances made to these types of clients entail higher risks than advances made to companies who are able to access traditional credit sources 
numerous factors may affect a client s ability to make scheduled payments on its loan  including the failure to meet its business plan or a downturn in its industry 
in part because of their smaller size  our clients may experience significant variations in operating results  have narrower product lines and market shares than their larger competitors  be particularly vulnerable to changes in customer preferences and market conditions  be more dependent than larger companies on one or more major customers  the loss of which could materially impair their business  financial condition and prospects  face intense competition  including from companies with greater financial  technical  managerial and marketing resources  depend on the management talents and efforts of a single individual or a small group of persons for their success  the death  disability or resignation of whom could materially harm the client s financial condition or prospects  have less skilled or experienced management personnel than larger companies  or do business in regulated industries  such as the healthcare industry  and could be adversely affected by policy or regulatory changes 
accordingly  any of these factors could impair a client s cash flow or result in other events  such as bankruptcy  which could limit that client s ability to repay its obligations to us  and may lead to losses in our portfolio and a decrease in our revenues  net income and assets 
our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to accurately judge the credit performance of our portfolio and  as a result  increases the risk that our allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate 
our business depends on the creditworthiness of our clients 
while we conduct extensive due diligence and a thorough review of the creditworthiness of each of our clients  this review requires the application of significant judgment by our management 
our judgment may not be correct 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses on our financial statements in an amount that reflects our judgment concerning the potential for losses inherent in our portfolio 
management periodically reviews the appropriateness of our allowance considering economic conditions and trends  collateral values and credit quality indicators 
because our loan loss history to date and the relative lack of seasoning of our loans make it difficult to judge the credit performance of our portfolio  we cannot assure you that our estimates and judgment with respect to the appropriateness of our allowance for loan losses are accurate 
our allowance may not be adequate to cover credit losses in our portfolio as a result of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or events adversely affecting specific clients  industries or markets 
if our allowance for loan losses is not adequate  our net income will suffer  and our financial performance and condition could be significantly impaired 
we may not have all of the material information relating to a potential client at the time that we make a credit decision with respect to that potential client or at the time we advance funds to the client 
as a result  we may suffer losses on loans or make advances that we would not have made if we had all of the material information 
there is generally no publicly available information about the privately owned companies to which we generally lend 
therefore  we must rely on our clients and the due diligence efforts of our employees to obtain the information that we consider when making our credit decisions 
to some extent  our employees depend and rely upon the management of these companies to provide full and accurate disclosure of material information concerning their business  financial condition and prospects 
if we do not have access to all of the material information about a particular client s business  financial condition and prospects  or if a client s accounting records are poorly maintained or organized  we may not make a fully informed credit decision which may lead  ultimately  to a failure or inability to recover our loan in its entirety 
we may make errors in evaluating accurate information reported by our clients and  as a result  we may suffer losses on loans or advances that we would not have made if we had properly evaluated the information 
we underwrite our loans based on detailed financial information and projections provided to us by our clients 
even if clients provide us with full and accurate disclosure of all material information concerning their businesses  our investment officers  underwriting officers and credit committee members may misinterpret or incorrectly analyze this information 
mistakes by our staff and credit committee may cause us to make loans that we otherwise would not have made  to fund advances that we otherwise would not have funded or result in losses on one or more of our existing loans 
a client s fraud could cause us to suffer losses 
a client could defraud us by  among other things directing the proceeds of collections of its accounts receivable to bank accounts other than our established lockboxes  failing to accurately record accounts receivable aging  overstating or falsifying records showing accounts receivable or inventory  or providing inaccurate reporting of other financial information 
the failure of a client to accurately report its financial position  compliance with loan covenants or eligibility for additional borrowings could result in the loss of some or all of the principal of a particular loan or loans including  in the case of revolving loans  amounts we may not have advanced had we possessed complete and accurate information 
our concentration of loans to a limited number of borrowers within a particular industry  such as the commercial real estate or healthcare industry  or region could impair our revenues if the industry or region were to experience economic difficulties 
defaults by our clients may be correlated with economic conditions affecting particular industries or geographic regions 
as a result  if any particular industry or geographic region were to experience economic difficulties  the overall timing and amount of collections on our loans to clients operating in those industries or geographic regions may differ from what we expected and result in material harm to our revenues  net income and assets 
for example  as of december   loans representing of the aggregate outstanding balance of our loan portfolio were secured by commercial real estate other than healthcare facilities 
if the commercial real estate sector were to experience economic difficulties  we could suffer losses on these loans 
in addition  as of december   loans representing of the aggregate outstanding balance of our loan portfolio were to clients in the healthcare industry 
additionally  our two largest loans with an outstanding principal balance of million and million were asset based loans to related healthcare clients 
reimbursements under the medicare and medicaid programs comprise the bulk of the revenues of many of these clients 
our clients dependence on reimbursement revenues could cause us to suffer losses in several instances 
if clients fail to comply with operational covenants and other regulations imposed by these programs  they may lose their eligibility to continue to receive reimbursements under the program or incur monetary penalties  either of which could result in the client s inability to make scheduled payments to us 
if reimbursement rates do not keep pace with increasing costs of services to eligible recipients  or funding levels decrease as a result of increasing pressures from medicare and medicaid to control healthcare costs  our clients may not be able to generate adequate revenues to satisfy their obligations to us 
if a healthcare client were to default on its loan  we would be unable to invoke our rights to the pledged receivables directly as the law prohibits payment of amounts owed to healthcare providers under the medicare and medicaid programs to be directed to any entity other than the actual providers 
consequently  we would need a court order to force collection directly against these governmental payors 
there is no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining this type of court order 
as of december   our ten largest clients collectively accounted for approximately of the aggregate outstanding balance of our loan portfolio and our largest client accounted for approximately of the aggregate outstanding balance of our loan portfolio 
because of the nature of our loans and the manner in which we disclose client and loan concentrations  it may be difficult to evaluate our risk exposure to any particular client or group of related clients 
we use the term client to mean the legal entity that is the borrower party to a loan agreement with us 
we have several clients that are related to each other through common ownership and or management 
because we underwrite all of these loans separately  we report each loan to one of these clients as a separate loan and each client as a separate client 
in situations where clients are related through common ownership  to the extent the common owner suffered financial distress  it could be unable to continue to support our clients  which could  in turn  lead to financial difficulties for those clients 
further  some of our healthcare clients are managed by the same entity  and to the extent that management entity suffered financial distress or was otherwise unable to continue to manage the operations of the related clients  those clients could  in turn face financial difficulties 
in both of these cases  our clients could have difficulty servicing their debt to us  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
we may be unable to recognize or act upon an operational or financial problem with a client in a timely fashion so as to prevent a loss of our loan to that client 
our clients may experience operational or financial problems that  if not timely addressed by us  could result in a substantial impairment or loss of the value of our loan to the client 
we may fail to identify problems because our client did not report them in a timely manner or  even if the client did report the problem  we may fail to address it quickly enough or at all 
as a result  we could suffer loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  net income and results of operations 
our balloon loans and bullet loans may involve a greater degree of risk than other types of loans 
as of december   approximately of the outstanding balance of our loans comprised either balloon loans or bullet loans 
a balloon loan is a term loan with a series of scheduled payment installments calculated to amortize the principal balance of the loan so that upon maturity of the loan more than  but less than  of the loan balance remains unpaid and must be satisfied 
a bullet loan is a loan with no scheduled payments of principal before the maturity date of the loan 
all of our revolving loans and some of our term loans are bullet loans 
on the maturity date  the entire unpaid balance of the loan is due 
balloon loans and bullet loans involve a greater degree of risk than other types of loans because they require the borrower to make a large final payment upon the maturity of the loan 
the ability of a client to make this final payment upon the maturity of the loan typically depends upon its ability either to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the loan prior to maturity  to refinance the loan or to sell the related collateral securing the loan  if any 
the ability of a client to accomplish any of these goals will be affected by many factors  including the availability of financing at acceptable rates to the client  the financial condition of the client  the marketability of the related collateral  the operating history of the related business  tax laws and the prevailing general economic conditions 
consequently  the client may not have the ability to repay the loan at maturity and we could lose some or all of the principal of our loan 
we are limited in pursuing certain of our rights and remedies under our term b  second lien and mezzanine loans  which may increase our risk of loss on these loans 
we make term b  second lien and mezzanine loans 
term b loans  which comprised of the aggregate outstanding balance of our loan portfolio as of december   are senior secured loans that are equal as to collateral and junior as to right of payment to obligations to clients other senior loans 
second lien loans are junior as to both collateral and right of payment to obligations to clients senior loans 
mezzanine loans may not have the benefit of any lien against the client s collateral and are junior to any lienholder both as to collateral and payment 
collectively  second lien and mezzanine loans comprised of the aggregate outstanding balance of our loan portfolio as of december  as a result of their junior nature  we may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights to collect principal and interest on these loans or to recover any of the loan balance through a foreclosure of collateral 
for example  typically we are not contractually entitled to receive payments of principal on a junior loan until the senior loan is paid in full  and may only receive interest payments on a term b  second lien or mezzanine loan if the client is not in default under its senior loan 
in many instances  we are also prohibited from foreclosing on a term b  second lien or mezzanine loan until the senior loan is paid in full 
moreover  any amounts that we might realize as a result of our collection efforts or in connection with a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving a client under a term b  second lien or mezzanine loan must generally be turned over to the senior lender until the senior lender has realized the full value of its own claims 
these restrictions may materially and adversely affect our ability to recover the principal of any non performing term b  second lien or mezzanine loans 
the collateral securing a loan may not be sufficient to protect us from a partial or complete loss if the loan becomes non performing  and we are required to foreclose 
while most of our loans are secured by a lien on specified collateral of the client  there is no assurance that the collateral securing any particular loan will protect us from suffering a partial or complete loss if the loan becomes non performing and we move to foreclose on the collateral 
the collateral securing our loans is subject to inherent risks that may limit our ability to recover the principal of a non performing loan 
listed below are some of the risks that may affect the value of different types of collateral in which we typically take a security interest 
inventory 
in those cases where we have taken a security interest in the inventory of the client  the inventory may not be adequate to fully secure our loan if  among other things  any of the following occur our valuation of the inventory at the time we made the loan was not accurate  there is a reduction in the demand for the inventory or the inventory becomes obsolete  the value of the inventory  including  for example  inventory in the retail industry  decreases due to seasonal fluctuations  the inventory is made up of several component parts and the value of those parts falls below expected levels  or the client misrepresents  or does not keep adequate records of  important information concerning the inventory such as the quantity or quality of inventory on hand 
accounts receivable 
factors that could reduce the value of accounts receivable securing our loans include  among other things problems with the client s underlying product or services which result in greater than anticipated returns or disputed accounts  unrecorded liabilities such as rebates  warranties or offsets  the disruption or bankruptcy of key customers who are responsible for material amounts of the accounts receivable  or the client misrepresents  or does not keep adequate records of  important information concerning the amounts and aging of its accounts receivable 
equipment 
the equipment of a client securing our loan could lose value as a result of  among other things changes in market or industry conditions  the failure of the client to adequately maintain or repair the equipment  or changes in technology or advances in new equipment that render the client s equipment obsolete or of limited value 
real estate 
the real estate of a client securing our loan could lose value as a result of  among other things changes in general or local market conditions  changes in the occupancy or rental rates of the property or  for a property that requires new leasing activity  a failure to lease the property in accordance with the projected leasing schedule  limited availability of mortgage funds or fluctuations in interest rates which may render the sale and refinancing of a property difficult  development projects that experience cost overruns or otherwise fail to perform as projected  unanticipated increases in real estate taxes and other operating expenses  challenges to the client s claim of title to the real property  environmental considerations  zoning laws  other governmental rules and policies  uninsured losses including possible acts of terrorism  or a decline in the operational performance at a facility on the real property such as a hotel  nursing home  hospital or other facility 
any one or more of the preceding factors could materially impair our ability to recover principal in a foreclosure on the related loan 
our cash flow loans are not fully covered by the value of tangible assets or collateral of the client and  consequently  if any of these loans becomes non performing  we could suffer a loss of some or all of our value in the loan 
cash flow lending involves lending money to a client based primarily on the expected cash flow  profitability and enterprise value of a client rather than on the value of its tangible assets 
these loans tend to be among the largest and most risky in our portfolio 
as of december   our portfolio included cash flow loans under which we had advanced an aggregate of billion  or  of the aggregate outstanding loan balance of our portfolio 
while in the case of our senior cash flow loans we generally take a lien on substantially all of the client s assets  the value of those assets is typically substantially less than the amount of money we advance to a client under a cash flow loan 
thus  if a cash flow loan became non performing  our primary recourse to recover some or all of the principal of our loan would be to force the sale of the entire company as a going concern 
if we were a subordinate lender rather than the senior lender in a cash flow loan  our ability to take such action would be further constrained by our agreement with the senior lender 
the risks inherent in cash flow lending include  among other things  the following reduced use of or demand for the client s products or services and  thus  reduced cash flow of the client to service the loan as well as reduced value of the client as a going concern  lack of support from the client s equity sponsor  poor accounting systems of the client which adversely affect our ability to accurately predict the client s cash flows  economic downturns  political events and changes  regulatory changes including changes in or enforcement of environmental laws  litigation or acts of terrorism that affect the client s business  financial condition and prospects  and poor management performance 
additionally  many of our clients use the proceeds of our cash flow loans to make acquisitions 
poorly executed or poorly conceived acquisitions can tax management  systems and the operations of the existing business  causing a decline in both the client s cash flow as well as the value of its business as a going concern 
in addition  many acquisitions involve new management teams taking over control of a business 
these new management teams may fail to execute at the same level as the former management team  which could reduce the cash flow of the client to service the loan as well as reduce the value of the client as a going concern 
errors by or dishonesty of our employees could result in loan losses 
we rely heavily on the performance and integrity of our employees in making our initial credit decision with respect to our loans and in servicing our loans after they have closed 
because there is generally little or no publicly available information about our clients  we cannot independently confirm or verify the information our employees provide us for use in making our credit and funding decisions 
errors by our employees in assembling  analyzing or recording information concerning our clients could cause us to originate loans or fund subsequent advances that we would not otherwise originate or fund 
this could result in losses 
losses could also arise if any of our employees were dishonest 
a dishonest employee could collude with our clients to misrepresent the creditworthiness of a prospective client or to provide inaccurate reports regarding the client s compliance with the covenants in its loan agreement 
if  based on an employee s dishonesty  we made a loan to a client that was not creditworthy or failed to exercise our rights under a loan agreement against a client that was not in compliance with covenants in the agreement  we could lose some or all of the principal of the loan 
we have financed in the past  and may finance in the future  the purchase by third parties of non performing loans or problem loans held by us 
these efforts may not eliminate our risk of loss or impairment with respect to these loans 
we may seek to sell non performing loans or the underlying collateral  at par or at a discount  to third parties to reduce our risk of loss 
we consider non performing loans to be either problem loans that we are actively seeking to out place or loans that are in workout status 
we may provide debt financing to the third parties to enable them to purchase these loans or collateral 
the non performing loan or the sold collateral may serve as the collateral for our loan to the purchaser 
in these instances we continue to bear the risk of loss associated with the collateral supporting our original non performing loan 
the loan to the purchaser  however  is reflected in our portfolio as a new loan 
for the year ended december   we consummated one transaction in which we financed the purchase of a non performing or underperforming loan from us by a third party 
as of december   the aggregate outstanding principal balance of this type of financing that we provided to third parties totaled million 
if interest rates continue to rise  some of our existing clients may be unable to service interest on their loans 
most of our loans bear interest at variable interest rates 
to the extent interest rates continue to increase  monthly interest obligations owed by our clients to us will also increase 
some of our clients may not be able to make the increased interest payments  resulting in defaults on their loans 
our loans could be subject to equitable subordination by a court and thereby increase our risk of loss with respect to such loans 
courts have  in some cases  applied the doctrine of equitable subordination to subordinate the claim of a lending institution against a borrower to claims of other creditors of the borrower  when the lending institution is found to have engaged in unfair  inequitable or fraudulent conduct 
the courts have also applied the doctrine of equitable subordination when a lending institution or its affiliates are found to have exerted inappropriate control over a client  including control resulting from the ownership of equity interests in a client 
in connection with the origination of loans representing approximately of the aggregate outstanding loan balance of our portfolio as of december   we have made direct equity investments or received warrants 
payments on one or more of our loans  particularly a loan to a client in which we also hold an equity interest  may be subject to claims of equitable subordination 
if  when challenged  these factors were deemed to give us the ability to control or otherwise exercise influence over the business and affairs of one or more of our clients  this control or influence could constitute grounds for equitable subordination 
this means that a court may treat one or more of our loans as if it were common equity in the client 
in that case  if the client were to liquidate  we would be entitled to repayment of our loan on an equal basis with other holders of the client s common equity only after all of the client s obligations relating to its debt and preferred securities had been satisfied 
one or more successful claims of equitable subordination against us could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operation or financial condition 
we may incur lender liability as a result of our lending activities 
in recent years  a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories  collectively termed lender liability 
generally  lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty  whether implied or contractual  of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders 
we may be subject to allegations of lender liability 
we cannot assure you that these claims will not arise or that we will not be subject to significant liability if a claim of this type did arise 
we have engaged in the past and may engage in the future in lending transactions with affiliates of our directors 
the terms of these transactions may not be in our shareholders best interests 
as of december   we had loans representing million in committed funds to companies controlled by affiliates of our directors 
we may make additional loans to affiliates of our directors in the future 
our conflict of interest policies  which require these transactions to be approved by the disinterested members of our board and be on substantially the same terms as loans to unrelated clients  may not be successful in eliminating the influence of conflicts 
as a result  these transactions may divert our resources and benefit our directors and their affiliates to the detriment of our shareholders 
we are not the agent for some of our loans and  consequently  have little or no control over how those loans are administered or controlled 
in some of our loans we are neither the agent of the lending group that receives payments under the loan nor the agent of the lending group that controls the collateral for purposes of administering the loan 
as of december   approximately of the aggregate outstanding balance of our loan portfolio comprised loans in which we are neither the paying nor the collateral agent 
when we are not the agent for a loan  we may not receive the same financial or operational information as we receive for loans for which we are the agent and  in many instances  the information on which we must rely is provided to us by the agent rather than directly by the client 
as a result  it may be more difficult for us to track or rate these loans than it is for the loans for which we are the agent 
additionally  we may be prohibited or otherwise restricted from taking actions to enforce the loan or to foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan without the agreement of other lenders holding a specified minimum aggregate percentage  generally a majority or two thirds of the outstanding principal balance 
it is possible that an agent for one of these loans may not manage the loan to our standards or may choose not to take the same actions to enforce the loan or to foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan that we would take if we were agent for the loan 
if we violate hud lending requirements  we could lose our ability to originate hud mortgage loans  which could adversely affect our financial results 
as an fha approved mortgagee  we could lose our ability to originate  underwrite and service fha insured loans if  among other things  we commit fraud  violate anti kickback laws  violate identity of interest rules  engage in a continued pattern of poor underwriting  or the fha loans we originate show a high frequency of loan defaults 
our inability to engage in our hud business would lead to a decrease in our net income 
some of our borrowers require licenses  permits and other governmental authorizations to operate their businesses  which licenses  permits or authorizations may be revoked or modified by federal  state and local governmental authorities 
any revocation or modification could have a material adverse effect on the business of a borrower and  consequently  the value of our loan to that borrower 
in addition to our loans to borrowers in the healthcare industry subject to medicare and medicaid regulation discussed above  other borrowers in specified industries require permits and or licenses from various governmental authorities to operate their businesses 
these governmental authorities may revoke or modify such licenses or permits if a borrower is found in violation of any regulation to which it is subject 
in addition  these licenses may be subject to modification by order of governmental authorities or periodic renewal requirements 
the loss of a permit  whether by termination  modification or failure to renew  could impair the borrower s ability to continue to operate its business in the manner in which it was operated when we made our loan to it  which could impair the borrower s ability to generate cash flows necessary to service our loan or repay indebtedness upon maturity  either of which outcomes would reduce our revenues  cash flow and net income 
we make loans to commercial developers 
these borrowers face a variety of risks relating to development  construction and renovation projects  any of which may negatively impact their results of operations and impair their ability to pay interest and principal on our loans to them 
we make loans to clients for development  construction and renovation projects 
the ability of these clients to make required payments to us on these loans is subject to the risks associated with these projects including the risks that a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources if the client determines that the development opportunity is not feasible or if it is unable to obtain all necessary zoning and other required governmental permits and authorizations  development  construction and renovation costs of a project may exceed original estimates  the client may be unable to attract creditworthy tenants or buyers  as the case may be  to its properties  occupancy rates at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable  and projects may not be completed on schedule as a result of several factors  many of which are beyond the control of the client  such as weather  labor conditions and material shortages  resulting in increased construction costs and decreases in revenue  thereby reducing the client s available cash 
if one of these projects is not successful  it could have a material adverse effect on the client s financial condition and results of operations  which could limit that client s ability to repay its obligations to us 
our loans to foreign clients may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in loans to us clients 
loans to foreign clients may expose us to risks not typically associated with loans to us clients 
these risks include changes in exchange control regulations  political and social instability  expropriation  imposition of foreign taxes  less liquid markets and less available information than is generally the case in the united states  higher transaction costs  less developed bankruptcy laws  difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations  lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility 
to the extent that any of our loans are denominated in foreign currency  they will be subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency will change in relation to one or more other currencies 
among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances  the level of short term interest rates  differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies  long term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation  and political developments 
we may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks  but we can offer no assurance that such strategies will be effective 
we may in the future expand our operations in jurisdictions outside the united states  which would subject us to additional regulatory requirements  which may prove difficult to monitor or comply with  and which could subject us to higher than expected operating costs 
the financial services industry is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions outside the united states 
the varying requirements of these jurisdictions may be inconsistent with us rules and may adversely affect our business or limit our ability to operate internationally 
we may not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals  or if approvals are obtained  we may not be able to continue to comply with the terms of the approvals or applicable regulations 
in addition  in many countries  the regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving  and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact regulatory requirements 
our ability to operate as profitably as we expect internationally depends on our ability to respond effectively to the challenges posed by these additional and uncertain regulations 
our debtor in possession loans may have a higher risk of default 
we from time to time make debtor in possession loans to clients that have filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code  which are used by these clients to fund on going operations as part of the reorganization process 
while our security position for these loans is generally better than for our other asset based loans  there is a higher risk of default on these loans due to the uncertain business prospects of these clients 
furthermore  if our predictions as to the outcome or timing of a reorganization are inaccurate  the client may not be able to make payments on the loan on time or at all 
several factors may affect our ability to accurately predict the outcome or timing of the reorganization including the possibility of litigation between the participants in the reorganization proceeding  the need to obtain mandatory or discretionary consents from various governmental authorities or others  and our inability to access reliable information concerning material developments affecting the client or which cause delays in the completion of a reorganization 
we may purchase distressed loans for more than we are able to recover on such loans 
we may purchase loans of companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties  including companies involved in bankruptcy or other reorganization and liquidation proceedings 
although such investments may result in significant returns to us  they involve a substantial degree of risk 
any one or all of the loans which we purchase may be unsuccessful or not show any return for a considerable period of time 
the level of analytical sophistication  both financial and legal  necessary for making a profit on the purchase of loans to companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is unusually high 
there is no assurance that we will correctly evaluate the value of the assets collateralizing the loans or the prospects for a successful reorganization or similar action 
unless the loans are most senior  in any reorganization or liquidation proceeding relating to a distressed company  we may lose the entire amount of our loan  may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than our purchase price and or may be required to accept payment over an extended period of time 
risks related to our funding and leverage our ability to grow our business depends on our ability to obtain external financing 
we require a substantial amount of cash to make new loans and to fund obligations to existing clients 
in the past  we have obtained the cash required for our operations through the issuance of equity and convertible debentures and by borrowing money through credit facilities  term debt and repurchase agreements 
to date  our funding has been limited to these sources 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to access these or other sources of funds in the future 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to extend the term of any of our existing financing arrangements or obtain sufficient funds to repay any amounts outstanding under any financing arrangement before it expires  either from one or more replacement financing arrangements or an alternative debt or equity financing 
if we were unable to repay or refinance any amounts outstanding under any of our existing financing arrangements  our ability to operate our business in the ordinary course would be severely impaired 
even if we are able to refinance our debt  we may not be able to do so on favorable terms 
if we are not able to obtain additional funding on favorable terms or at all  our ability to grow our business will be severely impaired 
if our lenders terminate any of our credit facilities  we may not be able to continue to fund our business 
at december   we had four credit facilities a million facility  a million facility  a million facility and a million facility 
the majority of our loans that we have not securitized are held in these facilities 
under the terms of these facilities we receive the cash flow generated by our loans held in these facilities after deductions for monthly interest and fee payments payable to our lenders 
our credit facilities contain customary representations and warranties  covenants  conditions and events of default that if breached  not satisfied or triggered could result in termination of the facilities 
consequently  if one or more of these facilities were to terminate prior to its expected maturity date  our liquidity position would be materially adversely affected  and we may not be able to satisfy our outstanding loan commitments  originate new loans or continue to fund our operations 
our lenders could terminate us as servicer of our loans held as collateral for our credit facilities or term debt  which would adversely affect our ability to manage our portfolio 
upon the occurrence of specified servicer defaults  our lenders under our credit facilities and the holders of our asset backed notes issued in our term debt transactions may elect to terminate us as servicer of the loans under the applicable facility or term debt transaction and appoint a successor servicer 
if we were terminated as servicer  we would no longer receive our servicing fee 
in addition  because there could be no assurance that any successor servicer would be able to service the loans according to our standards  any transfer of servicing to a successor servicer could result in reduced or delayed collections  delays in processing payments and information regarding the loans and a failure to meet all of the servicing procedures required by the applicable servicing agreement 
consequently  the performance of our loans could be adversely affected and our income generated from those loans significantly reduced 
our liquidity position could be adversely affected if we were unable to complete additional term debt transactions on favorable terms or at all 
through december   we had completed six term debt transactions  all of which we accounted for on balance sheet  through which we raised billion in debt capital to support our lending activities 
our term debt consists of asset securitization transactions in which we transfer loans to a trust that aggregates our loans and  in turn  sells notes collateralized by the trust s assets to institutional investors 
the securities issued by the trusts have been rated by three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
our goal in completing these transactions was to raise additional capital to pay down our borrowings under our credit facilities and to create additional liquidity under our credit facilities for use in funding our loans 
we intend to continue to incur term debt through on balance sheet asset securitization transactions in the future 
relevant considerations regarding our ability to complete additional term debt transactions include to the extent that the capital markets generally  and the asset backed securities market in particular  suffer disruptions  we may be unable to complete term debt transactions  disruptions in the credit quality and performance of our loan portfolio  particularly that portion which has been previously securitized and serves as collateral for existing term debt transactions  could reduce or eliminate investor demand for our term debt transactions in the future  our ability to service our loan portfolio must continue to be perceived as adequate to make the securities issued attractive to investors  any material downgrading or withdrawal of ratings given to securities previously issued in our term debt transactions would reduce demand for additional term debt transactions by us  our term debt transactions require the delivery of legal opinions from our counsel to the effect that the transactions constitute true sales of our loans to bankruptcy remote special purpose entities whose assets would not be consolidated with ours in the event of our future bankruptcy 
to the extent the legal landscape changed or our counsel otherwise determined that they could no longer render these opinions  our ability to consummate additional term debt transactions on favorable terms could be impaired 
furthermore  changes in the legal landscape or the inability to render these opinions could have adverse effects on our existing term debt transactions  and structural changes imposed by the rating agencies or investors may reduce the leverage we are able to obtain  increase the cost and otherwise adversely affect the efficiency of our term debt transactions 
if we are unable to continue completing these term debt transactions on favorable terms or at all  our ability to obtain the capital needed for us to continue to grow our business would be adversely affected 
in turn  this could have a material adverse effect on our growth and stock price 
the cash flows we receive from the interests we retain in our term debt transactions could be delayed or reduced due to the requirements of the term debt  which could impair our ability to originate new loans or fund commitments under existing loans 
we have retained the two most junior classes of securities  totaling million in principal amount  issued in our  and term debt transactions 
the notes issued in these term debt transactions that we did not retain are senior to the junior securities we did retain 
our receipt of future cash flows on those junior securities is governed by provisions that control the distribution of cash flows from the loans included in our term debt 
generally  principal cash flows from those loans must be used to reduce the outstanding balance of the senior notes issued in the term debt transactions and are not available to us until the full principal balance of the senior notes has been repaid 
on a monthly basis  interest cash flows from the loans must first be used to pay the interest on the senior notes  expenses of the term debt transaction and to maintain a required minimum interest reserve 
any related interest cash flows remaining after the payment of these amounts plus any reductions in the minimum interest reserve are distributed to us 
we have retained the most junior classes of securities  totaling million in principal amount  issued in our  and term debt transactions 
the notes issued in these term debt transactions that we did not retain are senior to the junior securities we did retain 
our receipt of future cash flows on those junior securities is governed by provisions that control the distribution of cash flows from the loans included in our term debt transactions 
generally  repayments received on the loans are applied on a pro rata basis to each class of notes based on the respective original principal amounts of each class of notes 
on a monthly basis  interest cash flows from the loans must first be used to pay the interest on the senior notes  to fund expenses of these term debt transactions and to maintain a required minimum interest reserve 
any interest cash flows remaining after the payment of these amounts plus any reductions in the minimum interest reserve are distributed to us 
several factors may influence the timing and amount of the cash flows we receive from loans included in our term debt transactions  including if any loan included in a term debt transaction becomes days or more delinquent  the full principal balance of that loan must be included in the interest reserve 
we will not receive any distributions from interest cash flows until the interest reserve is fully funded 
if a loan included in a term debt transaction has defaulted or is charged off  the full principal balance of that loan must be distributed to the senior noteholders to reduce the outstanding balance of the senior notes 
we will not receive any distributions from interest cash flows until the full amount of defaulted and charged off loans has been distributed 
changes in interest rates and repayment schedules may increase the amount of interest cash flows necessary to fund hedge payments required by  and costs associated with  our term debt transactions 
as a result  interest cash flows must be used to make payments related to the hedging arrangements  thereby reducing the cash flows available to us 
if the actual prepayment rate of the loans included in a term debt transaction is less than the estimated prepayment rate assumed under that term debt transaction  the notes issued under that term debt transaction will remain outstanding past their expected maturities 
in such event  interest cash flows must be used to pay the principal value of the senior notes issued in the term debt transaction until they are fully repaid  thereby eliminating the cash flows available to us until after the senior notes are fully repaid 
in our term debt transaction  certain changes were made from our prior transactions with respect to the effect of modifications to loans 
these changes result in a greater likelihood that a loan will be deemed delinquent or charged off  which adversely affects our ability to receive cash flow from the term debt transaction 
in connection with the term debt transaction  we agreed to amend our term debt transaction to make similar changes regarding loan modifications 
our term debt transaction included similar changes and we expect our future term debt transactions to have similar provisions 
we may be unable to repay or repurchase our convertible debentures 
at maturity  the entire outstanding principal amount of our convertible debentures will become due and payable 
debentureholders may also require us to repurchase their debentures on certain specific dates 
in addition  we intend to make irrevocable elections in accordance with the terms of the indentures governing the debentures to satisfy in cash of the principal amount of the debentures converted or that we may be required to purchase at the option of the holders upon any fundamental change such as a merger or consolidation involving our company 
we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay the principal amount due at maturity or upon conversion  or the repurchase price of the debentures 
any future borrowing arrangements or debt agreements to which we become a party may contain restrictions on or prohibitions against our repayment or repurchase of the debentures 
if we are prohibited from repaying or repurchasing the debentures  we could try to obtain the consent of lenders under those arrangements  or we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the restrictions 
if we do not obtain the necessary consents or refinance the borrowings  we will be unable to repay or repurchase the debentures 
any such failure would constitute an event of default under the indentures which could  in turn  constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness 
fluctuating or rising interest rates could adversely affect our profit margins and ability to grow our business 
we borrow money from our lenders at variable interest rates 
we generally lend money at variable rates based on the prime rate 
many of our loans contain interest rate floors which result in rates above the contractual variable rate specified in the applicable loan agreement 
our operating results and cash flow depend on the difference between the interest rate at which we borrow funds and the interest rate at which we lend these funds 
in addition  changes in market interest rates  or in the relationships between short term and long term market interest rates  or between different interest rate indices  could affect the interest rates charged on interest earning assets differently than the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  which could result in an increase in interest expense relative to our interest income 
because there is no active trading market for most of the loans in our portfolio  we might not be able to sell them at a favorable price or at all 
we may seek to dispose of one or more of our loans to obtain liquidity or to reduce potential losses with respect to non performing assets 
there generally is no established trading market for our loans 
consequently  if we seek to sell a loan  there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so at a favorable price or at all 
risks related to our operations and financial results our limited operating history limits your ability to evaluate our business and prospects and may increase your investment risk 
we commenced operations in september and  as a result  have only a limited operating history for purposes of your evaluation of our business and prospects 
because of this limited operating history  we may not be able to successfully compete with our competitors for loan opportunities  continue to find loan opportunities that meet our strict underwriting parameters  continue to grow and manage our growth  predict what level of delinquencies or defaults we may experience with respect to our loans over longer periods of time  raise additional capital that may be required to fund our ongoing operations  or respond to changes in the marketplace 
our operating results may fluctuate and  therefore  you should not rely on our results in any prior reporting period to be indicative of our performance in future reporting periods 
many different factors could cause our operating results to vary from quarter to quarter  including those factors discussed in this section 
if we fail to effectively manage our growth  our financial results could be adversely affected 
we have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception in as of december   we had employees and offices 
from our inception to december   our assets have grown to billion 
our growth may place a strain on our loan origination and loan management systems and resources 
we must continue to refine and expand our marketing capabilities  our management procedures  our internal controls and procedures  our access to financing sources and our technology 
as we grow  we must continue to hire  train  supervise and manage new employees 
we may not be able to hire and train sufficient lending and administrative personnel or develop management and operating systems to manage our expansion effectively 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our operations and our financial results could be adversely affected 
we may be adversely affected by deteriorating economic or business conditions 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by various economic factors  including the level of economic activity in the markets in which we operate 
delinquencies  foreclosures and credit losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions 
because we lend primarily to small and medium sized businesses  many of our clients may be particularly susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to make scheduled payments of interest or principal on their borrowings during these periods 
therefore  to the extent that economic activity or conditions deteriorate  our non performing assets are likely to increase and the value of our portfolio is likely to decrease 
adverse economic conditions also may decrease the value of the collateral securing some of our loans as well as the value of our equity investments 
further economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a decrease in our revenues  net income and assets 
unfavorable economic conditions may also make it more difficult for us to maintain both our new business origination volume and the credit quality of new business at levels previously attained 
unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs  limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us 
these events could significantly harm our operating results 
our commitments to lend additional sums to existing clients exceed our resources available to fund these commitments 
as of december   our contractual commitments to lend additional sums to our clients under our outstanding loan agreements exceeded by million our cash on hand and the borrowing availability under our existing financing arrangements 
we expect that our loan commitments will continue to exceed our available funds indefinitely 
under the terms of our loan agreements our clients generally cannot require us to fund the maximum amount of our commitments unless they are able to demonstrate  among other things  that they have sufficient collateral to secure all requested additional borrowings 
there is a risk that we have miscalculated the likelihood that our clients will be eligible to receive and will  in fact  request additional borrowings in excess of our available funds 
if our calculations prove incorrect  we will not have the funds to make these loan advances without obtaining additional financing 
our failure to satisfy our full contractual funding commitment to one or more of our clients could create breach of contract liability for us and damage our reputation in the marketplace  which could then have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are in a highly competitive business and may not be able to take advantage of attractive lending opportunities 
the commercial lending industry is highly competitive 
we have competitors who also make the same types of loans to the small and medium sized privately owned businesses that are our target clients 
our competitors include a variety of specialty and commercial finance companies  national and regional banks  private mezzanine funds  insurance companies  private investment funds  investment banks  and other equity and non equity based investment funds 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
they also have greater access to capital than we do and at a lower cost than is available to us 
furthermore  we would expect to face increased price competition if lenders seek to expand within or enter our target markets 
increased competition could cause us to reduce our pricing and lend greater amounts as a percentage of a client s eligible collateral or cash flows 
even with these changes  in an increasingly competitive market  we may not be able to attract and retain new clients and sustain the rate of growth that we have experienced to date  and our market share and future revenues may decline 
if our existing clients choose to use competing sources of credit to refinance their loans  the rate at which loans are repaid may be increased  which could change the characteristics of our loan portfolio as well as cause our anticipated return on our existing loans to vary 
acquisitions of other finance companies or loan portfolios may adversely impact our business 
as part of our business strategy  we have in the past purchased other finance companies as well as loan portfolios and related assets from other finance companies  and we expect to continue these activities in the future 
future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the incurrence of additional debt 
in addition  we face certain risks from our recent asset acquisitions and may face additional risks from future acquisitions  including difficulties in integrating the operations  services  products and personnel of the acquired company or loan portfolio  heightened risks of credit losses as a result of acquired loans not having been originated by us in accordance with our rigorous underwriting standards  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the potentially adverse effects that acquisitions may have in terms of the composition and performance of our loan portfolio  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
our business is highly dependent on members of our credit committee 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our chief executive officer  our president  our chief credit officer our chief legal officer and the presidents of our three businesses who collectively comprise our credit committee 
members of our credit committee have been directly responsible for all of our credit approval decisions since inception 
if any of them were to die  become disabled or otherwise leave our employ  we might not be able to replace him with someone of equal skill or ability 
moreover  our credit committee might not continue to function well without the continued services of the former officer 
risks related to our common stock the price of our common stock may be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially 
the price of the common stock which prevails in the market may be higher or lower than the price you pay  depending on many factors  some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance 
these fluctuations could cause you to lose part or all of your investment in our common stock 
those factors that could cause fluctuations include  but are not limited to  the following price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of financial services companies  actual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts  general economic conditions and trends  major catastrophic events  loss of a major funding source  rating agency downgrade of term debt notes  sales of large blocks of our stock  or departures of key personnel 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
due to the potential volatility of our stock price  we may therefore be the target of securities litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources from our business 
if a substantial number of shares become available for sale and are sold in a short period of time  the market price of our common stock could decline 
if our existing shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 
as of december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
in addition  exercisable options for  shares are held by our employees 
subject to rule compliance  approximately  additional shares are eligible for sale in the public market 
the perception in the public market that our existing shareholders might sell shares of common stock could also depress our market price 
a decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities 
some provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter third parties from acquiring us 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for  among other things a classified board of directors  restrictions on the ability of our shareholders to fill a vacancy on the board of directors  the authorization of undesignated preferred stock  the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without shareholder approval  and advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which restricts the ability of any shareholder that at any time holds more than of our voting shares to acquire us without the approval of shareholders holding at least of the shares held by all other shareholders that are eligible to vote on the matter 
these anti takeover defenses could discourage  delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions than you desire 
insiders continue to have substantial control over us and could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions  including a change of control 
our greater than shareholders  directors and executive officers and entities affiliated with them own approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  these shareholders  if acting together  would be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other extraordinary transactions 
they may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests 
the concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  preventing or deterring a change of control of our company  could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock 
we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and  consequently  your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates 
we do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future 
consequently  the only way to achieve a return on your investment will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit 
there is no guarantee that the price of our common stock that will prevail in the market will ever exceed the price that you pay

equity price risk the debentures we issued in march are initially convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
at the initial conversion price  each  of principal of the debentures is convertible into shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
prior to the effective date of eitf  we intend to make the irrevocable election to pay the principal balance of the debentures in cash upon any conversion or repurchase prior to or at their respective maturities 
holders of the debentures may convert their debentures prior to maturity only if the sale price of our common stock reaches specified thresholds  the trading price of the debentures falls below a specified threshold  the debentures have been called for redemption  or specified corporate transactions occur 
in addition  in the event of a significant change in our corporate ownership or structure  the holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of their debentures for of the principal amount 
concurrently with our sale of these debentures  we entered into two separate call option transactions with an affiliate of one of the initial purchasers  in each case covering the same number of shares as into which the debentures are initially convertible 
in one transaction  we purchased a call option at a strike price equal to the initial conversion price of the debentures 
this option expires on march  and requires physical settlement 
at the time we make the irrevocable election to pay the principal balance of the debentures in cash  we also intend to amend this option to provide that it may be settled in net shares so that the option continues to mirror the terms of the debentures 
we intend to exercise this call option from time to time as necessary to acquire shares that we may be required to deliver upon receipt of a notice of conversion of the debentures 
in the second transaction  we sold warrants to one of the initial purchasers for the purchase of up to million of our common shares at a strike price of approximately per share 
the warrants expire at various dates from march through june and must be settled in net shares 
the net effect of entering into the call option and warrant transactions was to minimize potential dilution as a result of the conversion of the debentures by increasing the effective conversion price of the debentures to a premium over the march  closing price of our common stock 
the call option and warrant transactions were net settled at a net cost of approximately million  which we paid from the proceeds of our sale of the debentures and is included as a net reduction in shareholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet
