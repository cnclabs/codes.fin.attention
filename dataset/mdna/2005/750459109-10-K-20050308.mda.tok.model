table of contents risk factors risk factors related to our business because of our dependence on certain customers  the loss of  or a substantial decline in sales to  a top customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
during  we derived of our revenues from five customers 
these five customers were nokia  nortel  ibm  comverse and diebold 
during  revenues attributable to nokia and nortel were and  respectively 
we believe that sales to these customers will continue to be a substantial percentage of our revenues 
a financial hardship experienced by  or a substantial decrease in sales to any one of our top customers could materially affect revenues and profitability 
we are shifting our business from predominately perfect fit solutions to more standards based products  such as atca products  which requires substantial expenditures for research and development and could adversely affect our short term earnings and  if the strategy is not properly executed  it could have a material adverse effect on our long term revenues  profitability and financial condition 
we are shifting our business from predominately perfect fit solutions to more standards based solutions  such as atca products 
there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
this strategy requires us to make substantial expenditures for research and development in new technologies that we reflect as a current expense in our financial statements 
we believe that these investments in standards based products and new technologies will allow us to provide a broader set of products and building blocks to take to market and allow us to grow on a long term basis 
revenues from some of these investments  such as atca  are not expected to result in any significant revenue opportunities for at least twelve to eighteen months 
accordingly  these expenditures could adversely affect our short term earnings 
in addition  there is no assurance that these new products and technologies will be accepted by our customers and  if accepted  how large the market will be for these products or what the timing will be for any meaningful revenues 
if we are unable to successfully develop and sell standards based products to our customers  our revenues  profitability and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
not all new product development projects ramp into production  and if ramped into production the volumes derived from such projects may not be as significant as we had originally estimated  which could have a substantial negative impact on our anticipated revenues and profitability 
if a product development project actually ramps into production  the average ramp into production begins about months after the project launch  although some more complex projects can take up to months or longer 
after that  there is an additional time lag from the start of production ramp to peak revenue 
not all projects ramp into production and even if a project is ramped into production  the volumes derived from such projects may not be as significant as we had originally estimated 
projects are sometimes canceled or delayed  or can perform below original expectations  which can adversely impact anticipated revenues and profitability 
our business depends on the service provider  commercial and enterprise systems markets in which demand can be cyclical  and any inability to sell products to these markets could have a material adverse effect on our revenues 
we derive our revenues from a number of diverse end markets  some of which are subject to significant cyclical changes in demand 
in  we derived  and of our revenues from the service provider  the commercial and the enterprise systems markets  respectively 
we believe that our revenues will continue to be derived primarily from these three markets 
service provider revenues include  but are not limited to  telecommunications sales to comverse  lucent  nokia and nortel 
commercial systems revenues include  but are not limited to  sales to agilent technologies  beckman coulter  diebold  philips medical and seimens ag 
enterprise systems revenues include  but are not limited to  sales to avaya  ibm and nortel 
generally  our customers are not the end users of our products 
if our customers 
table of contents experience adverse economic conditions in the markets into which they sell our products end markets  we would expect a significant reduction in spending by our customers 
some of these end markets are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change and economic uncertainty 
our exposure to economic cyclicality and any related fluctuation in customer demand in these end markets could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition 
significant reduction in our customers spending  such as what we experienced in and  will result in decreased revenues and earnings 
we continue to execute on our strategy of expanding into new end markets either through new product development projects with our existing customers or through new customer relationships  but no assurance can be given that this strategy will be successful 
our projections of future revenues and earnings are highly subjective and may not reflect future results that may result in volatility in the price of our common stock 
most of our major customers have contracts but these contracts do not commit them to purchase a minimum amount of our products 
these contracts generally require our customers to provide us with forecasts of their anticipated purchases 
however  our recent experience indicates that customers can change their purchasing patterns quickly in response to market demands and therefore these forecasts may not be relied upon to accurately forecast sales 
from time to time we provide projections to our shareholders and the investment community of our future sales and earnings 
since we do not have long term purchase commitments from our major customers and the customer order cycle is short  it is difficult for us to accurately predict the amount of our sales and related earnings in any given period 
our projections are based on management s best estimate of sales using historical sales data  information from customers and other information deemed relevant 
these projections are highly subjective since sales to our customers can fluctuate substantially based on the demands of their customers and the relevant markets 
if our actual sales or earnings are less than the projected amounts  the price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
because of our dependence on a few suppliers  or in some cases one supplier  for some of the components we use  as well as our dependence on a few contract manufacturers to supply a majority of our products  a loss of a supplier  a shortage of any of these components  or a loss of a contract manufacturer could have a material adverse effect on our business or our financial performance 
we depend on a few suppliers  or in some cases one supplier  for a continuing supply of the components we use in the manufacture of our products and any disruption in supply could adversely impact our financial performance 
for example  we are dependent solely on intel for the supply of some microprocessors and other components  and we depend on lsi  epson electronic america  broadcom  nec  chen ming  triax and texas instruments as the sole source suppliers for other components such as integrated circuits and mechanical assemblies 
alternative sources of supply for some of these components would be difficult to locate and or it would require a significant amount of time and resources to establish an alternative supply line 
we also rely on contract manufacturers as the sole suppliers of certain radisys products 
for example foxconn produces certain products that we do not produce internally and that no other contact manufacturer produces for us 
alternative sources of supply for the radisys products that our contract manufacturers produce would be difficult to locate and or it would require a significant amount of time and resources to establish an alternative supply line  including transitioning the products to be internally produced 
we are shifting a significant portion of our manufacturing to third party contract manufacturers and our inability to properly transfer our manufacturing or any failed or less than optimal execution on their behalf could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
we have traditionally manufactured a substantial portion of our products 
to lower our costs and provide better value and more competitive products for our customers and to achieve higher levels of global fulfillment  we are shifting a significant amount of our manufacturing to third party contract manufacturers 
at the end of  our contract manufacturing partners were manufacturing approximately 
table of contents of all of our unit volume 
we expect to increase our outsourcing to our contract manufacturers to or more of our unit volume by the end of if we do not properly transfer our manufacturing expertise to these third party manufacturers or they fail to adequately perform  our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
we also rely on contract manufacturers as the sole suppliers of certain radisys products 
for example foxconn produces certain products that we do not produce internally and that no other contact manufacturer produces for us 
alternative sources of supply for the radisys products that our contract manufacturers produce would be difficult to locate and or it would require a significant amount of time and resources to establish an alternative supply line  including transitioning the products to be internally produced 
we currently utilize several contract manufacturers for outsourced board and system production  however  we depend on two primary contract manufacturing partners  foxconn  and celestica  inc competition in the market for embedded systems is intense  and if we lose our position  our revenues and profitability could decline 
we compete with a number of companies providing embedded systems  including advantech co  artesyn technologies  continuous computing  embedded communications computing group  a unit of motorola  hewlett packard  divisions within intel corporation and ibm  kontron ag  mercury computer systems  performance technologies and sbs technologies 
because the embedded systems market is growing  it is attracting new non traditional competitors 
these non traditional competitors include contract manufacturers that provide design services and asian based original design manufacturers 
some of our competitors and potential competitors have a number of significant advantages over us  including a longer operating history  greater name recognition and marketing power  preferred vendor status with our existing and potential customers  and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  which allow them to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and customer requirements 
furthermore  existing or potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships with each other or with third parties or adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
as a result of increased competition  we could encounter significant pricing pressures 
these pricing pressures could result in significantly lower average selling prices for our products 
we may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  cost reductions or otherwise 
in addition  many of the industries we serve  such as the communications industry  are encountering market consolidation  or are likely to encounter consolidation in the near future  which could result in increased pricing pressure and additional competition 
potential acquisitions and partnerships may be more costly or less profitable than anticipated and may adversely affect the price of our company stock 
future acquisitions and partnerships may involve the use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity or equity linked securities  issuance of debt and amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives 
moreover  to the extent that any proposed acquisition or strategic investment is not favorably received by shareholders  analysts and others in the investment community  the price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
in addition  acquisitions or strategic investments involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  
table of contents risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
in the event that an acquisition or a partnership does occur and we are unable to successfully integrate operations  technologies  products or personnel that we acquire  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our international operations expose us to additional political  economic and regulatory risks not faced by businesses that operate only in the united states 
in  we derived of our revenues from canada and mexico  of our revenues from emea and from asia pacific 
in addition  during we opened a development center in shanghai  china and began to utilize a contract manufacturer in shenzhen  china 
as a result  we are subject to worldwide economic and market condition risks generally associated with global trade  such as fluctuating exchange rates  tariff and trade policies  domestic and foreign tax policies  foreign governmental regulations  political unrest  wars and other acts of terrorism and changes in other economic conditions 
these risks  among others  could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position 
additionally  some of our sales to overseas customers are made under export licenses that must be obtained from the united states department of commerce 
protectionist trade legislation in either the united states or other countries  such as a change in the current tariff structures  export compliance laws  trade restrictions resulting from war or terrorism  or other trade policies could adversely affect our ability to sell or to manufacture in international markets 
furthermore  revenues from outside the united states are subject to inherent risks  including the general economic and political conditions in each country 
these risks  among others  could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position 
if we are unable to generate sufficient income in the future  we may not be able to fully utilize our net deferred tax assets or support our current levels of goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet 
we cannot provide absolute assurance that we will generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets of million as of december  we may not generate sufficient taxable income due to earning lower than forecasted net income or incurring charges associated with unusual events  such as restructurings and acquisitions 
accordingly  we may record a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets if our expectations of future taxable income are not achieved 
on the other hand  if we generate taxable income in excess of our expectations  the valuation allowance may be reduced accordingly 
we also cannot provide absolute assurance that future income will support the carrying amount of goodwill and intangibles of million on the consolidated balance sheet as of december   and therefore  we may incur an impairment charge in the future 
because we have material levels of customer specific inventory  a financial hardship experienced by our customers could have a material adverse impact on our profitability 
we provide long life support to our customers and therefore we have material levels of customer specific inventory 
a financial hardship experienced by our customers could materially affect the viability of the dedicated inventory  and ultimately adversely impact our profitability 
our products for embedded computing applications are based on industry standards  which are continually evolving  and any failure to conform to these standards could have a substantial negative impact on our revenues and profitability 
we develop and supply a mix of perfect fit and standards based products 
standards based products for embedded computing applications are often based on industry standards  which are continually evolving 
our future success in these products will depend  in part  upon our capacity to invest in  and successfully develop and introduce new products based on emerging industry standards 
our inability to invest in or conform to these standards could render parts of our product portfolio uncompetitive  unmarketable or obsolete 
as our addressable markets develop new standards  we may be unable to 
table of contents successfully invest in  design and manufacture new products that address the needs of our customers or achieve substantial market acceptance 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may lose a valuable competitive advantage or be forced to incur costly litigation to protect our rights 
we are a technology dependent company  and our success depends on developing and protecting our intellectual property 
we rely on patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property 
at the same time  our products are complex  and are often not patentable in their entirety 
we also license intellectual property from third parties and rely on those parties to maintain and protect their technology 
we cannot be certain that our actions will protect proprietary rights 
if we are unable to adequately protect our technology  or if we are unable to continue to obtain or maintain licenses for protected technology from third parties  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our period to period revenues  operating results and earnings per share fluctuate significantly  which may result in volatility in the price of our common stock 
the price of our common stock may be subject to wide  rapid fluctuations 
our period to period revenues and operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary in the future  and any such fluctuations may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
fluctuations in the stock price may also be due to other factors  such as changes in analysts estimates regarding earnings  or may be due to factors relating to the service provider  commercial and enterprise systems markets in general 
shareholders should be willing to incur the risk of such fluctuations 
oregon corporate law  our articles of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us even if the change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders 
our articles of incorporation and our bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company  even if a change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders 
these provisions authorize our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without prior shareholder approval to increase the number of outstanding shares and deter or prevent a takeover attempt  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of shareholders to elect director candidates  and limit the ability of shareholders to take action by written consent  thereby effectively requiring all common shareholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our common shareholders 
in addition  if our common stock is acquired in specified transactions deemed to constitute control share acquisitions  provisions of oregon law condition the voting rights that would otherwise be associated with those common shares upon approval by our shareholders excluding  among other things  the acquirer in any such transaction 
provisions of oregon law also restrict  subject to specified exceptions  the ability of a person owning or more of our common stock to enter into any business combination transaction with us 
the foregoing provisions of oregon law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 

table of contents in recent years  various state  federal and international laws and regulations governing the collection  treatment  recycling and disposal of certain materials used in the manufacturing of electrical and electronic components have been enacted 
in support of these laws and regulations  we will incur significant additional expenditures and we may incur additional capital expenditures and asset impairments to ensure that our products and our vendor s products are in compliance with these regulations  and we may also incur significant penalties in connection with any violations of these laws 
additionally  failure to comply with these regulations could have an adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result  our financial condition or operating results may be negatively impacted 
the most significant pieces of legislation relate to two european union eu directives aimed at wastes from electrical and electronic equipment weee and the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances rohs 
specifically  the rohs directive prohibits the use of certain types of materials  such as lead  in the manufacturing of electronic products 
as of july  products sold within the eu  a market in which we sell a significant amount of our products  must be rohs compliant 
failure to comply with such legislation could result in our customers refusing to purchase our products and subject us to significant monetary penalties in connection with a violation  both of which could have a materially adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
other risk factors related to our business other risk factors include  but are not limited to  changes in the mix of products sold  regulatory and tax legislation  changes in effective tax rates  inventory risks due to changes in market demand or our business strategies  potential litigation and claims arising in the normal course of business  credit risk of customers and other risk factors 
proposed changes to accounting rules  including proposals to account for employee stock options as a compensation expense  could materially increase the expense that we report under generally accepted accounting principles and adversely affect our operating results

beginning in the first quarter of  we initiated a restructuring of our operations 
as a result  we committed to vacate properties according to our restructuring plans 
we partially vacated facilities in boca raton  florida and fully vacated facilities in campbell  california and houston  texas

backlog was approximately million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within months 
the general trend within our addressable markets is for shorter lead times and supplier managed inventory  which has been decreasing backlog as a percentage of revenue 
we believe the increase in revenues from to reflected our improving position in a number of diverse and improving end markets and the success of new product introductions 
the increase in revenues for 
table of contents compared to was primarily attributable to sales volume increases driven by improved infrastructure capital spending in our end markets and shipments of new products that were completed in ramping into production in we believe that our customers end markets that we serve will continue to see growth in and that our position in these markets will continue to strengthen with our commitment to providing leading embedded solutions 
we currently believe that our customers end markets will experience mid to high single digit growth rates in and that we will grow faster than our customers end markets in we anticipate growth due to new product introductions and we expect to design and supply more of our customers solutions 
in we shifted more investment from predominantly one off custom designed products to standards based  re usable platforms and solutions 
we believe standards based platforms provide our customers a number of fundamental benefits 
first  by using ready made platform solutions rather than ground start custom designs  our customers can achieve significantly shorter intervals and faster time to market 
second  we believe our customers can achieve a lower total cost by using solutions that are leveraged across multiple applications rather than a single use proprietary solution 
by offering ready made platforms  we believe we have the opportunity to address a wider range of new market opportunities with the potential for faster time to revenue than with ground start  custom designs 
we believe this ability to reuse designs makes our business and investment model more scalable 
finally  we believe this standard focused model will allow us to provide more integrated and higher value solutions to our customers than we have typically delivered under a custom design model 
we announced our promentum tm family of advancedtca products in this family of products includes universal carrier cards  switch and control modules  disk storage modules  compute modules  and a slot shelf or chassis 
these products will be offered individually or will be integrated together as part of a blade server platform system known as the promentum we believe the promentum system will provide customers a highly reliable managed platform on which to build their new voice and data offerings 
we have significant experience in the design  delivery and deployment of carrier grade  modular platforms 
we believe the atca standard increases our opportunity to implement reusable platforms  enabling the deployment of more flexible solutions based on cost effective commercial technologies 
we believe our core atca solutions will be applicable across a wide range of customers and applications and are potentially applicable in all three of our defined markets 
these integrated hardware and software platforms make extensive use of common architectural and component designs  with carrier grade operating systems and middleware  reducing development time and costs and enhancing application portability 
in addition to our new atca offerings  we recently announced our new procelerant tm series of modular computing solutions  which we anticipate will be released in mid  for customers in our commercial systems markets for medical  transaction terminals and test and measurement applications 
these new modular products are currently in development and we believe these products will represent a family of high density  flexible solutions that will enable commercial systems customers to achieve more rapid time to market with cost effective designs 
income from continuing operations was million in  million in and a net loss from continuing operations of million in income per share from continuing operations was and  basic and diluted  respectively  for compared to and  basic and diluted  respectively  in net loss per share from continuing operations was  basic and diluted  in in light of overall market conditions and the economic downturn during and  we initiated several cost reduction measures 
beginning in  we initiated a restructuring of our operations  and as a result  we recorded several restructuring charges in  and the restructuring activities occurring prior to included workforce reductions  consolidation of certain facilities  fixed asset and capitalized software write downs  and other costs  and were largely intended to align our capacity and infrastructure to anticipated near term demand for our products 
we realized the effect of reducing our cost structure beginning in and continued to see cost structure reductions in we also recorded restructuring charges in which were not associated with cost reduction measures but were instead related to the continued effort to develop the skills necessary to support our shift in business strategy from 
table of contents predominately custom designed solutions to more standards based solutions 
the restructurings were also initiated as a result of the level of increased outsourcing which has partially reduced our need for internal resources 
in early we initiated an aggressive strategic plan to reduce material costs  which began to show results in the latter half of and in we also instituted other cost cutting measures during and  including office closures and tighter controls on discretionary spending 
these general cost cutting measures resulted in higher margins and lower operating expenses in than in previous years 
during we completed the sale of our multibus business unit and during we completed the sale of our savvi business  to allow us to focus on our core embedded systems business and core tier oem customers within our three primary markets 
the increase in income from continuing operations in compared to was primarily due to growing our revenues without proportionately increasing our operating expenses 
we have engaged in several actions that have further improved our profitability in compared to  including increasing the level of outsourced manufacturing to further control product costs  continuing the initiative to reduce material costs  and initiating other operating cost cutting and control measures  including office space reductions and closures and tighter controls on discretionary spending 
net income was million and million in and  respectively  and net loss was million in net income per share was and  basic and diluted  respectively  in compared to  basic and diluted  in net loss per share was  basic and diluted  in during the first quarter of  we completed the sale of our savvi business which allowed us to focus on our core embedded systems business within our three primary markets 
the million loss from discontinued operations recorded in the first quarter of includes a million loss on the sale of the savvi business as well as thousand of net losses incurred by the business unit during the quarter 
in the second quarter of  we bought out the remaining lease obligations for the houston  texas manufacturing facility at a discount 
the houston facility was vacated as part of the second quarter of  fourth quarter of and first quarter of restructuring events 
in august  we announced plans to eliminate approximately engineering and marketing positions in our birmingham  uk office during the fourth quarter of we have integrated the work done by these employees into other radisys locations 
in conjunction with these position eliminations  some r d spending will be re directed to align with our strategy to deliver more integrated standards based solutions 
in october  we announced plans to eliminate approximately to positions during the fourth quarter of and to record a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of these reductions were a result of the increase in outsourced manufacturing as well as to continue our shift of skills required to develop  market  sell  and support more advanced embedded platforms and solutions 
we expect the workforce reduction to be substantially completed by march  as we continue to execute on our strategy of increasing the level of outsourced manufacturing  we may incur additional restructuring charges 
we have also begun to invest in infrastructure in emerging markets such as china 
we continue to ramp up the hiring of engineers for our shanghai r d center 
a significant portion of our products are currently assembled by our china based manufacturing partner s china based facilities and we expect to increase this outsourcing activity in we have hired employees in china to support the outsourcing initiative  and we have also added sales and marketing support personnel in china to focus on selling product into this region 
we expect a combined overall decrease in research and development and sales  marketing and administrative expenses of between thousand and thousand for the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the decrease is the result of a reduction in costs associated with the implementation of the sarbanes oxley act and reduced spending associated with the development and fourth quarter launch of our atca family of products 
in november  we completed a private offering of convertible senior notes due november  to qualified institutional buyers  resulting in net proceeds of million 
we plan to 
table of contents use the proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes including working capital  potential acquisitions  partnership opportunities and potential repayment of existing debt obligations 
in early  we incurred expenses of thousand to evaluate a potential acquisition that did not occur 
we plan to actively continue evaluating potential acquisitions and partnership opportunities 
during the second quarter of  we repurchased million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes in the open market for million 
during  we incurred thousand of stock based compensation expense associated with shares issued pursuant to the company s employee stock purchase plan espp 
we incurred stock based compensation expense because the original number of espp shares approved by the shareholders was insufficient to meet employee demand for an espp offering consummated in february and ending in august we subsequently received shareholder approval for additional espp shares in may we currently do not anticipate incurring stock based compensation expense subsequent to associated with our espp under the intrinsic value method 
beginning in the third quarter of the company will recognize stock based compensation expense based on the fair value method  as required by sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
on november   the compensation and development committee of the board of directors approved an acceleration of vesting of those employee stock options with an option price greater than  which was greater than the fair market value of the shares on that date 
approximately million options with varying remaining vesting schedules were subject to the acceleration and became immediately exercisable 
as a result of the acceleration  we expect to reduce our exposure to the effects of the financial accounting standards board fasb proposal to require companies to recognize stock based compensation expense associated with stock options based on the fair value method 
the fasb proposal will be effective beginning the second half of fiscal year upon adoption of this proposal we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments 
if we were to continue to use the fair value method currently used for reporting pro forma disclosures of net income loss and net income loss per common share  we estimate a reduction in stock based compensation expense associated with the acceleration of approximately million for the last six months of and million for the year ended december  cash  cash equivalents and investments amounted to million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and investments during compared to  was primarily due to the repurchase of million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes for million 
this was partially offset by positive cash from operations in the amount of million in the increase in cash  cash equivalents and investments during compared to  was primarily due to the issuance of our convertible senior notes resulting in net proceeds of million and generation of million of cash flows from operations in in  we sold our des moines  iowa facility to a third party for million  generating positive cash flow amounting to thousand 
in  we repurchased million of the convertible subordinated notes for million 
we generated net cash from operations in excess of net income in  and we continued to improve our cash cycle time  primarily by increasing inventory turns and decreasing the days that customer accounts receivable are outstanding 
we believe that cash flows from operations  available cash and investment balances  and short term borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs for the short term and long term 
in  we obtained board authorization to repurchase all remaining convertible subordinated notes  and we may elect to use a portion of the cash  cash equivalents and investment balances to repurchase additional amounts of the convertible subordinated notes 
in the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations  we intend to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  changes in certain key items in those 
table of contents financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
inventory reserves we record the provision for inventory reserves for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories as the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
factors influencing the provision include changes in demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  and physical deterioration 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional provisions for inventory reserves may be required 
our estimate for the provision is based on the assumption that our customers comply with their current contractual obligations to us 
we provide long life support to our customers and therefore we have material levels of customer specific inventory 
if our customers experience a financial hardship or if we experience unplanned cancellations of customer contracts  the current provision for the inventory reserves may be inadequate 
additionally  we may incur additional expenses associated with any non cancelable purchase obligations to our suppliers if they provide customer specific components to us 
during the fourth quarter of  we revised our excess and obsolete inventory reserve calculation to more accurately reflect our true exposure to losses associated with excess and obsolete e o inventory moving forward 
we previously estimated our required reserve for excess inventory based on a forward projection of excess material beyond months demand 
this resulted in a reserve estimate that was higher than the actual e o losses for products where our demand and orders are more sporadic 
our revised process combines the historical view of demand over the prior six months with a prospective view of demand over months 
we tested the revised method against prior periods and found it to be a more accurate predictor of excess inventory 
this change resulted in a reduction to the e o provision to the inventory reserve of approximately thousand in the fourth quarter of accrued warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our standard product warranty terms generally include post sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time  which is generally months after shipment 
the workmanship of our products produced by contract manufacturers is covered under warranties provided by the contract manufacturer for a specified period of time ranging from to months 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating 
table of contents the quality of our component suppliers 
our estimated warranty obligation is based upon ongoing product failure rates  internal repair costs  contract manufacturing repair charges for repairs not covered by the warranty provided by the contract manufacturer  product call rates  average cost per call and current period product shipments 
if actual product failure rates  repair rates  service delivery costs  or post sales support costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
additionally  we accrue warranty costs for specific customer product repairs that are in excess of our warranty obligation calculation described above 
long lived assets we assess impairment of property and equipment and definite lived intangible assets whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
during  we reviewed property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets for impairment due to several events  including the sale of the savvi business  the restructuring event in the first quarter  and the sale of our facility in des moines iowa 
as a result of the sale of the savvi business  we recorded an impairment of our intangible assets of million 
this impairment charge is included in the loss from discontinued operations related to the savvi business in the company disposed of million of net book value associated with the building and other office equipment as a result of the sale of the des moines  iowa facility 
the write off of the net book value associated with building and office equipment is included in loss on building sale in also in  we performed a fixed asset physical inventory count  during which we evaluated whether the carrying value of the property and equipment would be recoverable 
we recorded write offs of thousand as a result of the fixed asset physical inventory 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the assigned value of the net assets in connection with prior acquisitions 
conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
goodwill will be written down when impaired  rather than be amortized as previous standards required 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of september  and concluded that as of september   there was no goodwill impairment 
to determine whether or not goodwill may be impaired  we compare our book value to our market capitalization 
if the trading price or the average trading price of our common stock is below the book value per share for a sustained period  a goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing book value to estimated market value 
our book value per share was at september  additionally  we perform other tests  such as the multiple of revenues and present value of future cash flows to further validate the fair market value of the goodwill 
management concluded there was no indication of material changes requiring an updated goodwill impairment analysis as of december  we may be required  under certain circumstances  to update our impairment analysis  which may result in losses on acquired goodwill 
as a result of the sale of the savvi business in  we recorded million in write offs of goodwill 
this impairment charge is included in the loss from discontinued operations related to the savvi business in when we determine that the carrying value of property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets  or goodwill will not be recoverable  we calculate and record impairment losses based upon future estimates of cash flows 
we estimate future cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance 
our estimates of future cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  or changes to our business operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
the company records a valuation 
table of contents allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to more likely than not be realized in its future tax returns 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  adjustments to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required 
the net deferred tax assets amounted to million as of december  as of december  we estimate utilization of the net deferred tax assets will require that we generate million in taxable income prior to the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards which will occur between and we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets if our expectations of future taxable income are not achieved 
if we were to record a valuation allowance  the allowance could include the entire balance of net deferred tax assets as any significant departures from expected future taxable income could suggest uncertainty in our business and therefore we may determine that there is no reasonable basis to calculate a partial valuation allowance 
on the other hand  if we generate taxable income in excess of our future expectations  the valuation allowance may be reduced accordingly 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have a relatively small set of multinational customers that typically make up the majority of our accounts receivable balance 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our trade receivables balances are not overstated 
we record reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
if circumstances related to customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted 
at december   of our accounts receivable was due from our five largest customers 
if one of these large customers or a number of our smaller customers files for bankruptcy or otherwise is unable to pay us the amounts due the current allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 
at december   we specifically identified and reserved for one international customer that filed for bankruptcy 
at december   we recorded a reserve for this customer s account in the amount of approximately thousand and  subsequently  in we wrote off the account as we had determined that this account was uncollectible 
during we improved our international credit policies 
during the year ended december  there were no significant account balances reserved for and the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased by thousand as a result of the write off of previously specifically identified account balances 
we maintain a non specific bad debt reserve for all customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  trends in overall weighted average risk rating of the total portfolio  macroeconomic conditions  significant one time events and historical experience 
typically  this non specific bad debt reserve amounts to approximately of quarterly revenues 
accrued restructuring we have engaged  and may continue to engage  in restructuring actions  which require us to make significant estimates in several areas including realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete  expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  the ability to generate sublease income  as well as our ability to terminate lease obligations at the amounts we have estimated  and other exit costs 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
for a description of our restructuring actions  refer to our discussion of restructuring charges in the results of operations section 
revenue recognition we enter into contracts to sell our products and services  and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions under which we recognize revenue upon shipment of product  there are agreements that contain non standard terms and conditions 
non standard terms and conditions can include  but are not limited to  customer acceptance criteria or other post delivery obligations 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 

table of contents stock based compensation we currently account for the expense associated with our stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method 
we provide pro forma disclosures of net income loss and net income loss per common share as if the fair value method had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
equity instruments are granted to employees  directors  and consultants in certain instances  as defined in the respective plan agreements 
we currently use the black scholes model to measure our stock based compensation expense for the pro forma disclosures 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued its final determination on the issue of stock based compensation  requiring companies to account for stock based compensation based on the fair value method  which replaces the intrinsic value method 
for periods prior to the effective date of this change  pro forma disclosures will be an alternative to recognition in the financial statements 
we will be required to adopt this pronouncement in the third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption alternatives 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption  while the retroactive methods would require reporting compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
radisys is evaluating the requirements of the pronouncement and expects that the adoption of the pronouncement will have a material impact on radisys consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
radisys has not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of the pronouncement  and has not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures 
to determine the fair value of our stock based compensation plans  we currently take into consideration the following exercise price of the option or share expected life of the option or share price of our common stock on the date of grant expected volatility of our common stock over the life of the option or share risk free interest rate during the expected term of the option the calculation includes several assumptions that require management s judgment 
the expected life of the option or share is determined based on assumptions about patterns of employee exercises  and represents a probability weighted average time period from grant until exercise of stock options  subject to information available at time of grant 
determining expected volatility generally begins with calculating historical volatility for a similar long term period and then considering the ways in which the future is reasonably expected to differ from the past

revenues increased by million  or  from million in to million in included in the revenues in the first and fourth quarter of  are end of life component inventory sales to two of our major customers amounting to million and million  respectively 
these inventory sales were recorded as revenues but did not generate any gross profit since the inventory was sold at cost 
as of december  and december   backlog was approximately million and million  respectively 
generally  the increase in revenues in compared to is attributable to sales volume increases and new product sales in the end markets as described below 
the increase in revenues in compared to is due to an increase in revenues in the service provider systems  commercial systems and enterprise systems markets of million  million and thousand  respectively 
the end of life component inventory sales discussed above were included in the service provider systems market revenues in revenues in the service provider systems market increased in compared to the same periods in  primarily because we continue to design and supply more content within our customers g and g wireless infrastructure products 
the increase was also attributable to improved economic conditions causing market growth in the wireless infrastructure sub market 

table of contents revenue in the commercial systems market increased approximately million from levels to levels due to new product development projects ramping into production volumes and the economic recovery early in which buoyed demand in cyclical sub markets 
the test and measurement and industrial automation sub markets grew in response to strengthening market and global economic conditions 
test and measurement and medical sub markets also benefited from product development projects which ramped to production volumes in and increased revenues from medical  industrial automation and test and measurement were partially offset by lower revenues from the transaction terminals sub market as legacy business in that area decreased for products reaching or nearing end of life 
revenues in the enterprise systems market increased in compared to  primarily due to increased sales to the datacom sub market 
this is due to the ramp of a new product in this sub market into full production in mid partially offsetting this growth is a year over year decline in the telephony sub market 
given the dynamics of these markets  we may experience general fluctuations as a percentage of revenue attributable to each market and  as a result  the quarter to quarter comparisons of our market segments often are not indicative of overall economic trends affecting the long term performance of our end markets 
we currently expect that each of the three markets will continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues 
from a geographic perspective  in compared to the overall increase in revenues was concentrated in emea  which experienced an increase in revenues of million 
the increase in the revenues in emea in compared to  is primarily attributable to higher sales of wireless infrastructure products to nokia

we currently expect continued quarterly fluctuations in the percentage of revenue from each geographic region 
gross margin 
gross margin for was compared to for in  cost of sales includes thousand of stock based compensation expense which is discussed in stock based compensation expense below 
the following items affected gross margin as a percentage of revenues for compared to the e o reserve requirements  including transfers from adverse purchase commitments  decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in primarily because during the fourth quarter of  we revised the e o reserve calculation 
we previously estimated the required reserve for excess inventory based on a forward projection of excess material beyond months demand 
the revised process combines the historical view of demand over the prior six months with a prospective view of demand over months 
we tested the revised method against prior periods and found it to be a better indicator of excess inventory 
additionally  the e o inventory reserve requirements have decreased due to increasing demand and consumption for some of our older products 
warranty expenses have also decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in due to a few unique  specifically identified warranty related issues that made up a large portion of the warranty expense in the improvement in our gross margin from to which resulted from the decreases in e o inventory reserves and warranty reserves as a percentage of revenues was almost entirely offset by a shift in sales to higher volume products which have lower margins 
these lower margin products are primarily associated with sales to our larger customers that receive volume discounts 
further  during the first and fourth quarters of we had end of life component inventory sales to two of our major customers amounting to million and million  respectively 
these inventory sales did not generate any gross profit as the inventory was sold at cost 
our long term gross margin target range continues to be to  excluding any impact from the implementation of an accounting standard that will require the recognition of stock based compensation expense associated with employee stock options effective in the latter half of among other factors  our long term gross margin range is dependent upon successful execution of our outsourcing strategy

research and development expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in in  research and development expenses include thousand of stock based compensation expense which is discussed in stock based compensation expense below 
the increase in research and development expenses in compared to is due mainly to an increase in payroll related expenses  fees to outside contractors  and other costs associated with research and development programs  including materials for prototypes and beta versions of our products 
payroll related expenses increased due to additional personnel focused on research and development efforts  merit related salary increases and profit dependent compensation expenses 
during  we increased our investment in the development of standards based platforms  such as atca 
fees to outside contractors increased as we were working to meet several project deadlines to capitalize on customer and market opportunities 
we expect to continue to incur fees for outside contractors as we execute on our strategy to develop standards based platforms 
we completed the infrastructure and entity establishment work for our shanghai research and development design center  and in we began hiring additional staff for the design center 
our long term target for research and development expenses continues to be of revenues  excluding any impact from the implementation of an accounting standard that will require the recognition of stock based compensation expense associated with employee stock options effective in the latter half of selling  general  and administrative

in  we incurred thousand of stock based compensation expense  associated with shares issued pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan espp 
we incurred stock based compensation expense because the original number of espp shares approved by the shareholders was insufficient to meet employee demand for an espp offering consummated in february and ending in august we subsequently received shareholder approval for additional espp shares in may the shares issued in the february espp offering in excess of the original number of espp shares approved at the beginning of the offering the shortfall triggers recognition of stock based compensation expense under the intrinsic value method 
the shortfall amounted to thousand and thousand shares in may and august  respectively 
the expense per share was calculated as the difference between of the closing price of radisys shares as quoted on nasdaq on the date that additional espp shares were approved may and the february espp offering purchase price 
accordingly  the expense per share was calculated as the difference between and 
the shortfall of shares was dependent on the amount of shares purchased by participants enrolled in the february espp offering

intangible assets amortization 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology  patents and other identifiable intangible assets 
intangible assets amortization expense was million and million in and  respectively 
intangible assets amortization decreased due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the first and second quarters of we expect intangible assets amortization expense to decrease slightly in compared to due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during goodwill has been and will be periodically evaluated for impairment 
we perform reviews for impairment of goodwill and all purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of september  and concluded that as of september   there was no goodwill impairment 
we are required under certain circumstances  to update our impairment analysis  which may result in losses on acquired goodwill 
restructuring and other charges 
we evaluate the adequacy of accrued restructuring and other charges on a quarterly basis 
we record certain reclassifications and reversals to accrued restructuring and other charges based on the results of the evaluation 
the total accrued restructuring and other charges for each restructuring event are not affected by reclassifications 
reversals are recorded in the period in which we determine that expected restructuring and other obligations are less than the amounts accrued 
tables summarizing the activity in the accrued liability for each restructuring event are contained in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during and  we recorded restructuring and other charges and reversals as described below 
fourth quarter restructuring in october  we announced plans to eliminate approximately to positions during the fourth quarter of and to record a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of these reductions were a result of the increase in outsourced manufacturing as well as to continue our shift of skills required to develop  market  sell  and support more advanced embedded platforms and solutions 
we expect the workforce reduction to be substantially completed by march  the restructuring charge includes severance and other employee related separation costs of million for employees and associated legal fees of thousand 
third quarter restructuring in august  we announced plans to close our birmingham uk office and eliminate approximately engineering and marketing positions during the fourth quarter of we are integrating the work done by these employees into other radisys locations 
in conjunction with this elimination of positions  some r d spending will be re directed to align our strategy to deliver more integrated standards based solutions 
in connection with the third quarter restructuring event  we incurred employee termination and related costs of approximately thousand  of which thousand was reversed as two of the affected employees are relocating to continue their employment with us 
employee termination and related costs primarily includes employee severance 
in connection with the third quarter restructuring event  we incurred other charges of approximately thousand and expect to incur an additional thousand 
table of contents associated with the cost of relocating certain employees 
other charges include legal fees  human resource consulting fees and the costs of relocation 
additionally  we will incur additional costs to relocate property and equipment and may write off certain property and equipment with a net book value of approximately thousand 
a provision or impairment charge for these costs will be recorded in the period in which they are incurred 
we expect to complete these restructuring activities in the first quarter of first quarter restructuring in march  we recorded a restructuring charge of million as a result of our continued efforts to increase profitability and market diversification 
the restructuring charge included a net workforce reduction of employee positions 
the employee positions eliminated included from manufacturing operations  from shifts in portfolio investments  and eight in support functions 
reversals we recorded reversals amounting to million during related primarily to a buy out of the remaining lease obligations on our houston manufacturing facility  which was vacated as a result of various restructuring events 
the reversals also include various amounts originally accrued for certain non cancelable leases for facilities vacated as a result of the restructuring events 
we entered into subleasing arrangements for a portion of these remaining facilities and during updated our analysis of the subleasing arrangements 
as a result of this analysis we reversed a portion of restructuring reserves in connection with increased anticipated sublease income as well as previously unbilled charges owed from our sublease tenants 
loss gain on the repurchase of convertible notes

interest expense 
interest expense primarily includes interest expense incurred on convertible senior and subordinated notes 
interest expense decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in interest expense in compared to is due to the million decrease in interest expense associated with the convertible subordinated notes and a decrease in interest expense associated with a mortgage payable in the amount of thousand  partially offset by million of additional interest incurred on our convertible senior notes issued in november the decrease in the interest expense associated with our convertible subordinated notes is due to a decrease in the balance of outstanding convertible subordinated notes as a result of the repurchase of the notes during the first quarter of and the second quarter of in december  we sold our des moines  iowa facility 
as a result  we paid the mortgage payable in full 
we expect our interest expense to decrease to approximately million in due to the decrease in the outstanding balance of the convertible subordinated notes as a result of the repurchase of the notes during the second quarter of interest income 
interest income increased thousand  or  from million in to million in interest income increased primarily because of the increase in the amount of cash available to invest 
the cash available to invest increased due to the net proceeds from the offering of our convertible senior notes completed in november in the amount of million

other expense  net  primarily includes foreign currency exchange gains and losses and unusual items 
other expense  net  was thousand in compared to million in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a net loss of thousand in compared to a net loss of thousand in the decrease in the foreign currency exchange rate net loss is primarily due to decreased weakening of the us dollar relative to european currencies in compared to net of the change in net losses related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the change in other expense  net  in compared to  is primarily attributable to a loss related to an other than temporary decline in value on the investment in shares of ga express ga common stock amounting to thousand recorded in we hold shares in ga as a result of the sale of texas micro s sequoia enterprise systems business unit to ga in exchange for stock 
we acquired texas micro in factors we considered when we determined the decline in value on the investment in ga shares was other than temporary  include  but are not limited to  the likelihood that the related company would have insufficient cash flows to operate for the next months  significant changes in the operating performance or operating model and or changes in market conditions 
as of december   the estimated fair value of this investment is zero

income tax provision 
we recorded a tax provision of million from continuing operations and no income tax provision or benefit from discontinued operations for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we recorded a tax provision of thousand from continuing operations and no tax provision or benefit from discontinued operations 
our effective tax rate was in compared to in our current effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to the tax impact of income associated with foreign jurisdictions  tax benefits related to certain foreign sales  tax credits and other permanent differences 
we currently estimate that our effective tax rate for will be approximately 
the estimated effective tax rate is based on current tax law and the current expected income  and assumes that the company continues to receive the tax benefits associated with certain income associated with foreign jurisdictions 
the tax rate may be affected by potential acquisitions  restructuring events or divestitures  the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed  and the ability to realize deferred tax assets 
on october   the president of the united states signed the american jobs creation act of the act 
one of the key provisions of the act includes a repeal of the extraterritorial income exclusion with certain transitional rules 
in its place  the act provides a relief provision for domestic manufacturers by providing a new domestic manufacturing deduction 
the act also includes a temporary incentive for us multinationals to repatriate foreign earnings and other international tax reforms designed to improve the global competitiveness of us multinationals 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the act on our effective tax rate  cash flows and financial statements 
on october  the working families tax relief act of was enacted which extended several expired business related tax breaks  including the research and development tax credit 
under the new law the research and development tax credit was retroactively reinstated to june  and is available through december  for the year ended december  we recorded a research and development tax credit in the amount of thousand  a portion of which would not have been recorded had the working families tax relief act of not been enacted 
fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the act fsp  provides guidance under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
fsp states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of 
table of contents applying fasb statement no 
the company has not yet completed evaluating the impact of the repatriation provisions 
given the preliminary stage of our evaluation  it is not possible at this time to determine what impact the repatriation provisions will have on our consolidated tax accruals or our effective tax rate 
accordingly  as provided for in fsp  the company has not adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the act 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
valuation allowances of million and million  as of december  and  respectively  have been provided for deferred income tax assets related primarily to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that may not be realized 
the decrease in valuation allowance of million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the expiration of certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards in as of december  we estimate utilization of the net deferred tax assets will require that we generate million in taxable income prior to the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards which will occur between and management expects to return to significant levels of profitability  and therefore believes it is more likely than not that we will utilize a portion of the net deferred tax assets 
we cannot provide absolute assurance that we will generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets  and accordingly  we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets if our expectations of future taxable income are not achieved 
if we were to record a valuation allowance  the allowance could include the entire balance of net deferred tax assets as any significant departures from expected future taxable income could suggest uncertainty in our business and therefore we may determine that there is no reasonable basis to calculate a partial valuation allowance 
any tax benefit subsequently recognized from the acquired net operating loss carryforwards of microware would be allocated to goodwill 
in the irs completed an examination of our federal income tax returns for the years through the final audit report resulted in no negative consequences and was issued during the first quarter of we have agreed to the irs s proposed audit adjustments for all years under audit 
the proposed adjustments will result in an increase of thousand in the net operating loss carryforwards for the year there are no additional taxes  penalties and or interest related to the proposed audit adjustments 
however  the final results of the examination are subject to review and approval by the joint committee of taxation 
we do not expect the report on the final results of the examination as reviewed by the joint committee of taxation to differ from the audit report issued by the irs 
discontinued operations 
on march   we completed the sale of the savvi business resulting in a loss of million 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded million in write offs of goodwill and intangible assets 
the total million loss from discontinued operations recorded in the first quarter of includes the million loss on the sale of the savvi business as well as thousand of net losses incurred by the business unit during the quarter  before the business unit was sold 
comparison of year and year revenues 
revenues increased slightly by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in revenues in  compared to  is primarily due to an increase in revenues in the service provider systems market of million and an increase in the enterprise market of million offset by a decrease in revenues in the commercial systems market of million 
revenues in the service provider systems market increased in  compared to  primarily due to increased shipments of  and g wireless infrastructure products 
revenues in the enterprise market increased in  compared to  due to several enterprise design wins from ramping into production in generating additional revenues 
these design wins primarily relate to the security and converged networks sub markets of the enterprise market 
revenues in the commercial systems market decreased in  compared to  primarily due to sporadic demand in the industrial automation and gaming sub markets within the commercial systems market 
additionally  the decrease in the commercial systems market can be attributable to an increase in the number of product end of life orders fulfilled in given the dynamics of these markets  we may experience general fluctuations in the percentage of revenue attributable to each market 
we currently expect that  on average  each of the 
table of contents three markets will represent a significant portion of total revenues 
as of december   backlog was approximately million  compared to million as of december  additionally in  compared to  the overall increase in revenues was concentrated in the emea and asia pacific regions which experienced an increase in revenues of million  partially offset by a decrease in north american revenues of million 
gross margin 
gross margin for was  compared to for the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenues for  compared to  was primarily due to improvements in our manufacturing cost structure as a result of the restructuring events in the first quarter of and the second quarter of in addition  early in  we began an aggressive strategic plan to reduce material costs  which began to produce benefits in the latter half of during the fourth quarter of  we revised our excess and obsolete inventory reserve calculation to more accurately reflect our true exposure to losses associated with excess and obsolete e o inventory moving forward 
we estimate that this change resulted in a reduction to the e o provision to the inventory reserve of approximately thousand in the fourth quarter of research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary  bonuses  and benefits for product development staff  and cost of design and development supplies and equipment 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in research and development expenses is due mainly to a reduction in payroll related expenses of million in  compared to the reduction in payroll expenses is a result of decreases in headcount  primarily associated with the restructuring events in the first quarter of and the second quarter of in addition  the overall decrease in research and development expenses is a result of cost cutting measures undertaken in and  including office closures and tighter controls on discretionary spending

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity trading prices  which could affect our financial position and results of operations 
interest rate risk 
we invest excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and those of high quality corporate issuers 
we attempt to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market  and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decline 
due to the short duration of most of the investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
additionally  the interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not necessarily have a direct impact on our earnings or cash flows 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected  to any significant degree  by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on the securities portfolio 
the estimated fair value of our debt securities that we have invested in at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the effect of an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows 
foreign currency risk 
we pay the expenses of our international operations in local currencies  namely  the euro  british pound  new shekel  japanese yen and canadian dollar 
the international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  foreign exchange rate volatility and other regulations and restrictions 
accordingly  future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the balance sheets and income statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars during the consolidation process 
because exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely affect overall expected profitability 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a net loss of thousand  thousand and million for the years ended december    and  respectively
