item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
dollars in thousands  except per share data results of operations for the years ended december    and overview our primary business is the construction and sale of single family detached homes  townhomes and condominium buildings 
to fully serve our homebuilding customers  we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business 
we operate in the following markets washington washington  dc metropolitan area and adjacent counties in maryland  virginia and west virginia baltimore baltimore  md metropolitan area and adjacent counties in pennsylvania north delaware  new jersey  new york  ohio and pennsylvania south north carolina  south carolina  tennessee and richmond  va we believe we operate our business with a conservative operating strategy 
we do not engage in land development and primarily construct homes on a pre sold basis 
this strategy allows us to maximize 
table of contents inventory turnover  which enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital  thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital 
in addition  we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve 
this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets 
because we are not active in the land development business  our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build  and on our developers ability to deliver finished lots to timely meet the sales demands of our customers 
we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements purchase agreements 
these purchase agreements require deposits in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement 
however  this lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development 
as of december   we controlled approximately  lots with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately  and  respectively 
we also controlled approximately lots through investments in joint venture limited liability corporations 
consolidated revenues and net income for increased and  respectively  from the increase in net income coupled with our continuing share repurchase program resulted in a increase in diluted earnings per share in compared to homebuilding segment the following tables summarizes homebuilding settlements  new orders and backlog activity by region for each of the last three years year ended december  settlements washington baltimore north south total average settlement price new orders washington baltimore north south total average new order price backlog washington baltimore north south total average backlog price

this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in the average number of active communities in the baltimore region year over year  attributable primarily to development delays 
the increase in the value of new orders is primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in the number of new orders and strong housing demand which provided us the opportunity to raise selling prices  resulting in a increase in the average selling price in as compared to new orders for the full year ended increased to  units from  units in the value of new orders increased to  in from  in the increase in new orders occurred predominately in the north region as a result of a increase in the average number of active communities within this region 
the decrease in new orders in the washington region was primarily due to a reduction in the average number of active communities within that region 
the increase in gross profit margins in from is primarily attributable to favorable market conditions which allowed us to increase sales prices in a majority of our markets leading to the aforementioned increase in average settlement prices year over year 
these increases were partially offset by higher land  lumber and other commodity prices in as compared to gross profit margins in future periods may be negatively impacted by the trend of higher land  lumber and other commodity prices if we are unable to pass these increases through to our homebuyers on new orders 
gross profit margins for increased to compared to for the increase in profit margins was attributable to the favorable market conditions allowing nvr to raise sales prices on new orders in a majority of the markets nvr serves 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for increased from  but as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in from in the increase in sg a costs is primarily attributable to increased personnel costs and selling and marketing costs of approximately  and  respectively  due to our continued growth strategy 
sg a expenses for increased approximately from and as a percentage of revenues decreased to approximately in from in the increase in sg a costs in is primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs and selling and marketing costs of approximately  and  respectively  to facilitate continued growth objectives in existing markets  and to an approximate  increase in other general and administrative costs incidental to the aforementioned increase in revenues

nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment s customer base 
following is a table of financial and statistical data for the three years ended december   and loan closing volume total principal segment income capture rate mortgage banking fees net gain on sale of loans title services servicing fees gain on sale of servicing loan closing volume for the year ended december  increased from the increase is primarily attributable to a increase in the average loan amount  and a year over year increase in the number of units closed 
the increase in the average loan amount reflects the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment s average selling prices 
the unit increase for the year ended december  reflects an increase in the number of settlements by the homebuilding segment and a slight increase in the percentage of the number of loans closed for nvr s homebuyers who obtain a mortgage to purchase the home capture rate 

table of contents segment income for the year ended december  decreased approximately  from the decrease is primarily due to a product mix shift during from fixed rate mortgages to adjustable rate mortgages and brokered mortgages  both of which are generally less profitable products than fixed rate mortgages 
the decrease is also due to higher costs incurred of approximately  related to the contractual repayment of loan sale income to investors for loans that were paid in full within a set number of days following the sale of the loan 
the decreases due to the product mix shift and contractual repayments was partially offset by the higher loan volume 
general and administrative expenses have also increased during the year compared to by approximately  which is largely due to a increase in the total number of nvrm employees in versus the increased staffing level is to position nvrm for future growth and to increase the capture rate 
mortgage loans held for sale increased approximately  at december  compared to december  nvrm s product mix shift into adjustable rate mortgages  which are delivered into sales channels on a whole loan basis  has lengthened the average sale and funding cycle from third party investors 
even with the lengthened sale and funding cycle  mortgage loans held for sale are typically sold to third party investors in less than days from date of closing 
loan closing volume for the year ended december  increased over the increase compared to is solely attributable to a increase in the average loan amount due to the homebuilding segment s higher average selling prices 
the number of units closed was flat in compared to segment income for the year ended december  increased approximately  over the increase is primarily due to an increase in mortgage banking fees attributable to the aforementioned increase in closed loan volume  increased secondary marketing gains  and higher revenues per loan 
secondary marketing gains for increased approximately  over average revenues per loan including origination fees  ancillary fees and discount points for increased by approximately 
seasonality overall  we do not experience material seasonal fluctuations in sales  settlements or loan closings 
effective tax rate our consolidated effective tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate in was primarily due to the amendment of a long term cash incentive plan requiring executive officers to defer receipt of payments due under the plan until separation of service with nvr 
the effect of this amendment converted compensation expensed prior to january  from a permanent tax difference to a temporary tax difference  producing an approximate  deferred tax benefit

liquidity and capital resources lines of credit and notes payable our homebuilding segment generally provides for its working capital cash requirements using cash generated from operations and a short term unsecured working capital revolving credit facility the facility 
the facility provides for borrowings of up to  subject to certain borrowing base limitations and expires in august the facility bears interest at a variable rate based on the type of borrowing and other criteria set forth in the facility 
the weighted average interest rate for borrowings outstanding during was 
up to  of the facility is currently available for issuance in the form of letters of credit  of which  was outstanding at december  there were no direct borrowings outstanding under the facility as of december  at december   there were no borrowing base limitations reducing the amount available to us for borrowings 
nvr s mortgage banking segment provides for its mortgage origination and other operating activities using cash generated from operations as well as various short term credit facilities 
nvrm has available an annually renewable mortgage warehouse facility the revolving credit agreement with an aggregate borrowing limit of  to fund its mortgage origination activities  under which  was outstanding at december  as of december   borrowing base limitations reduced the amount available to nvrm for borrowings to approximately  the revolving credit agreement expires in august the interest rate under the revolving credit agreement is either i the london interbank offering rate libor plus  or ii to the extent that nvrm provides compensating balances 
the weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement was during nvrm s mortgage warehouse facility limits the ability of nvrm to transfer funds to nvr in the form of dividends  loans or advances 
in addition  nvrm is required to maintain a minimum net worth of  nvrm also currently has available an aggregate of  of borrowing capacity in an uncommitted gestation and repurchase agreement 
amounts outstanding under the uncommitted gestation and repurchase agreement accrue interest at various rates tied to the libor rate and are collateralized by gestation mortgage backed securities and whole loans 
there were no borrowings under this uncommitted facility during on january   we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec for the issuance of up to  of debt securities the shelf registration 
the shelf registration statement was declared effective on february  and provides that securities may be offered from time to time in one or more series  and in the form of senior or subordinated debt 
on june   we completed an offering  at par  for  of senior notes due the 
table of contents notes under the shelf registration 
the offering of the notes resulted in aggregate net proceeds of approximately  after deducting offering expenses 
the notes mature on june  and bear interest at  payable semi annually in arrears on june and december  commencing on december  the notes are general unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness and indebtedness under our existing credit facility 
the notes are senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness that we may incur 
we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at any time upon not less than nor more than days notice at a redemption price equal to the greater of a of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  or b the discounted present value of the remaining scheduled payments of the notes to be redeemed  plus  in each case  accrued and unpaid interest 
on july   we used approximately  of the proceeds received from the sale of the notes to redeem all of the  outstanding senior notes due at a price of of the principal amount outstanding  including the payment of accrued interest 
the redemption resulted in a charge to pre tax homebuilding income of  on may   we filed a shelf registration statement the shelf registration with the sec to register up to  for future offer and sale of debt securities  common shares  preferred shares  depositary shares representing preferred shares and warrants 
the sec declared the shelf registration effective on june  nvr expects to use the proceeds received from future offerings issued under the shelf registration for general corporate purposes 
in addition  we have  remaining available for issuance under the shelf registration 
this discussion of our shelf registration capacity does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale 
equity repurchases in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations  we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions 
this ongoing repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced board authorizations  and is typically executed in accordance with the safe harbor provisions of rule b of the securities act 
the repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective  creating increases in shareholder value 
see part ii  item of the form k for disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of  cash flows as shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december   our operating activities provided cash of  cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and by the realization of a tax benefit of  from employee stock based compensation activities  primarily employee stock option exercises 
these tax benefits were recorded directly to equity and reduced estimated tax payments during the year 
cash was also provided by a  increase in customer deposits resulting primarily from the increase in backlog units in as compared to cash was used primarily to fund increases in homebuilding inventory of  and to make deposits on fixed price purchase agreements with developers to acquire control of finished lots 
the increase in contract land deposits of  resulted in an increase in the number of lots under control to approximately  lots at december  from approximately  lots at december  net cash provided by investing activities was  for the year ended december   primarily due to principal payments received on mortgage loans held for sale  partially offset by capital spending 
net cash used for financing activities was  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of our ongoing common stock repurchase program 
we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock in for an aggregate purchase price of  
table of contents at december   the homebuilding and mortgage banking segments had restricted cash of  and  respectively  which includes certain customer deposits  mortgagor tax escrows  insurance escrows  completion escrows and other amounts collected at closing which relates to mortgage loans held for sale and to home sales 
we believe that internally generated cash and borrowings available under our credit facilities and the public debt markets will be sufficient to satisfy near and longer term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 
off balance sheet arrangements lot acquisition strategy we do not engage in the land development business 
instead  we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement 
the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage  typically ranging up to  of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 
our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development 
we may  at our option  choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract 
our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidating damage provision contained within the purchase agreements 
we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and  with the exception of one specific performance contract for lots existing at december   do not guarantee specific performance under these purchase agreements 
at december   we controlled approximately  lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately  by making or committing to make deposits of approximately  in the form of cash and letters of credit 
our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate  contractual commitment resulting from our non performance under the contracts is limited to the  deposit amount 
of the  deposit total  approximately  in cash and approximately  in letters of credit have been issued as of december   and  will be paid subsequent to december  assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers see contractual obligations section below 
bonds and letters of credit we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities  government agencies  or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts 
we had  of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december  inclusive of the  of lot acquisition deposits discussed above 
we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any losses under these bonds or letters of credit 
mortgage commitments and forward sales in the normal course of business  our mortgage banking segment enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of single family homes with fixed expiration dates 
the commitments become effective when the borrowers lock in a specified interest rate within time frames established by us 
all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment 
to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers  we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgage backed securities to broker dealers 
the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments classified as derivatives 
both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to broker dealers are undesignated derivatives  and accordingly are marked to market through earnings 
at december   there were contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating approximately  and open forward delivery sale contracts aggregating approximately  
table of contents contractual obligations our fixed  non cancelable obligations as of december   were as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years debt a capital leases b operating leases c purchase obligations d other long term liabilities e total a payments include interest payments due on the senior notes due see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding debt and related matters 
b the present value of these obligations is included on the consolidated balance sheets 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding capital lease obligations 
c see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding operating leases 
d amounts represent required payments of forfeitable deposits with land developers under existing fixed price purchase agreements assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers 
we expect to make all payments of these deposits within the next three years but due to the nature of the contractual development milestones that must be met  we are unable to accurately estimate the portion of the deposit obligation that will be made within one year and that portion that will be made within one to three years 
in addition to the  to be paid pursuant to the prior discussion  as of december   we had capitalized forfeitable deposits for fixed price purchase agreements with developers totaling  e amounts represent payments due under incentive compensation plans and are included on the consolidated balance sheets   of which is recorded in the mortgage banking accounts payable and other liabilities line item 
critical accounting policies general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements  and update those estimates as necessary 
in general  our estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals  and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 
variable interest entities in december  the fasb issued revised interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which was effective for us as of march  fin r requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate that entity 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual interests  or other financial interests in the entity 
expected losses are the expected negative variability in the fair value of an entity s net assets exclusive of its variable interests  and expected residual returns are the expected positive variability in the fair value of an entity s net assets  exclusive of its variable interests 

table of contents forward contracts  such as the fixed price purchase agreements utilized by us to acquire finished lot inventory  are deemed to be variable interests under fin r 
therefore  the development entities with which we enter fixed price purchase agreements are examined under fin r for possible consolidation by us  including the joint venture limited liability corporations llc s utilized by us on a limited basis 
we have developed a methodology to determine whether we or the owner s of the applicable development entity are the primary beneficiary of a development entity 
the methodology used to evaluate our primary beneficiary status requires substantial judgment and estimation 
these judgments and estimates involve assigning probabilities to various estimated cash flow possibilities relative to the development entity s expected profits and losses and the cash flows associated with changes in the fair value of finished lots under contract 
because we do not have any contractual or ownership interests in the development entities with which we contract to buy finished lots other than our limited use of the llc s  we generally do not have the ability to compel these development entities to provide financial or other data to assist us in the performance of the primary beneficiary evaluation 
in many instances  these development entities provide little  if any  financial information 
this lack of direct information from the development entities may result in our evaluation being conducted solely based on the aforementioned judgments and estimates 
further  where we deem ourselves to be the primary beneficiary of a development entity created after december  and that development entity refuses to provide financial statements  we utilize estimation techniques to perform the consolidation 
while we believe that our estimation techniques provide a reasonable basis of providing the financial condition of a development entity that refuses to provide financial statements  the actual financial condition of the development entity could differ from that reported 
although we believe that our accounting policy is designed to properly assess our primary beneficiary status relative to our involvement with the development entities from which we acquire finished lots  changes to the probabilities and the cash flow possibilities used in our evaluation could produce widely different conclusions regarding our status or non status as a development entity s primary beneficiary 
homebuilding inventory the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units 
field construction supervisors salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs 
interest costs are not capitalized into inventory 
upon settlement  the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis 
cost of manufacturing materials is determined on a first in  first out basis 
recoverability and impairment  if any  is primarily evaluated by analyzing sales of comparable assets 
we believe that our accounting policy is designed to properly assess the carrying value of homebuilding inventory 
contract land deposits we purchase finished lots under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract 
the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 
we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that we believe is sufficient to provide for losses in the existing contract land deposit portfolio 
the allowance reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure at the end of the reporting period  considering market and economic conditions  sales absorption and profitability within specific communities and terms of the various contracts 
although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december  balance sheet to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 
intangible assets reorganization value in excess of identifiable assets excess reorganization value and goodwill are no longer subject to amortization upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no  goodwill and other intangible assets 
rather  excess reorganization value and goodwill are subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining value of excess reorganization value and goodwill may not be recoverable 
at december   we believe that excess reorganization value and 
table of contents goodwill were not impaired 
this conclusion is based on our judgment  considering such factors as our history of operating success  our well recognized brand names and the significant positions held in the markets in which we operate 
however  changes in strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized for the amount that the carrying value of excess reorganization value and or goodwill exceeds their fair value 
warranty product liability accruals warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future costs as a result of construction and product defects  product recalls and litigation incidental to our business 
liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience  the likely current cost of corrective action  manufacturers and subcontractors participation in sharing the cost of corrective action  consultations with third party experts such as engineers  and discussions with our general counsel and other outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases 
although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december  balance sheet see note to the consolidated financial statements to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor  the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action  unanticipated adverse legal settlements  or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 
impact of inflation  changing prices and economic conditions see risk factors previously discussed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments 
interest rate risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers  while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans 
we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 
our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities 
the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans  which are either sold through optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets 
all of the mortgage banking segment s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments 
nvrm also sells substantially all of its mortgage servicing rights on a servicing released basis 
our homebuilding segment generates operating liquidity and acquires capital assets through fixed rate and variable rate debt 
the homebuilding segment s primary variable rate debt is a working capital revolving credit facility that currently provides for unsecured borrowings up to  subject to certain borrowing base limitations 
the working capital credit facility expires in august and outstanding amounts bear interest at our election based on the type of borrowing and other criteria set forth in the facility 
the weighted average interest rate for the amounts outstanding under the facility was during there were no amounts outstanding under the working capital revolving credit facility at december  at december   there were no borrowing base limitations reducing the amount available to us for borrowings 
nvrm generates operating liquidity primarily through the mortgage warehouse facility  which currently has a borrowing limit of  the interest rate under the mortgage warehouse facility is either i the london interbank offering rate libor plus  or ii to the extent that nvrm provides compensating balances 
the weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility was during mortgage loans and gestation mortgage backed 
table of contents securities collateralize the mortgage warehouse facility borrowings 
the mortgage warehouse facility is annually renewable and currently expires in august there was  outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility at december  the mortgage warehouse facility agreement includes  among other items  restrictions on nvrm incurring additional borrowings and making intercompany dividends and tax payments 
in addition  nvrm is required to maintain a minimum net worth of  at december   borrowing base limitations reduced the amount available to nvrm for borrowings to approximately  the following table represents the contractual balances of our on balance sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates  as well as the fair values of those on balance sheet financial instruments  at december  the expected maturity categories take into consideration historical and anticipated prepayment speeds  as well as actual amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness 
because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets  we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year 
consequently  outstanding warehouse borrowings and repurchase facilities are also assumed to mature in the first year
