the december officemax  inc  acquisition  strong sales growth in our officemax  contract segment and strong product prices in our boise building solutions segment were largely responsible for the fiscal increased sales and net income 
the officemax  contract segment operating income declined for the full year compared to the prior year despite strong sales growth 
the relatively weak profitability was due primarily to losses in the former officemax direct business acquired with the operations of officemax  inc in december the former officemax direct business included field salespeople  catalogs  a public internet site  which were added to our reliable catalog business 
officemax  contract profitability was also negatively impacted by the phasing in of new account growth  lags in passing through rising paper costs and weaker than expected canadian operations 
after recording million of operating income in the days of in which we owned it  our retail segment posted operating income of million for all of the low level of profitability in was due to weaker than expected sales  especially during the important back to school and holiday periods  which led to reduced margin dollars  lower vendor income  and a higher expense ratio as a percentage of sales 
officemax  retail s profitability was also negatively impacted by greater promotional sales at low or no profitability  in total  our office products segments realized synergies from the officemax  inc acquisition of approximately million in  which was approximately million more than originally anticipated 
these synergies were primarily related to increased purchasing leverage and savings from combining duplicative administrative  marketing and logistic functions 
the synergies in were offset by approximately million of integration and related costs 
continuing the trends that started in the second half of  boise building solutions performed strongly throughout the period in during which we owned it 
continued strong housing starts and low interest rates resulted in robust building products markets 
sales volume in building materials distribution grew  reaching record levels 
although paper markets showed signs of cyclical recovery in  weighted average prices for the grades of paper produced by boise paper solutions rose only modestly over levels 
in addition  unit manufacturing costs  especially chemical and fiber costs in boise paper solutions  increased from year earlier levels

prior to the sale  we accounted for the joint venture under the equity method 
accordingly  segment results do not include the joint venture s sales but do include million of equity in earnings during the ten months ended october   compared with million of equity in earnings in and million of equity in losses in before the gains recorded on the sale of timberlands and our interest in voyageur panel  segment income increased to million  compared with full year income  primarily due to increased product prices 
building materials distribution sales increased to billion in the first ten months of  compared with full year sales  due to strong pricing because of strong demand in the building sector 
sales of engineered wood products laminated veneer lumber  wood i joists and laminated beams increased in the first ten months of  compared with full year sales  also due to strong pricing 
as a result of increased demand from residential construction due to low interest rates  average plywood prices rose to per  square feet during the first ten months of average lumber prices increased during the same period 
sales volumes of plywood and lumber for the first ten months of declined from volumes because of the shorter reporting period in and the sale of our yakima  washington  plywood and lumber facilities in february the sale of our yakima facilities did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
compared with during the second half of  our building products business enjoyed one of the strongest building seasons ever  following a slow start in the first half of due to wet weather 
boise building solutions sales grew in  compared with the previous year 
structural panel prices rose 
building materials distribution sales increased due to strong pricing coupled with an increase in physical sales volume 
during  about of building materials distribution s lumber  panel and engineered wood product sales were from products manufactured by boise 
sales of engineered wood products laminated veneer lumber  wood i joists and laminated beams increased due to increased sales volume 
after a long  wet and cold spring  especially in the eastern united states  the building season got underway late in the second quarter and held strong through the first two months of fourth quarter as a result of increased demand from housing construction  prices for our major grades of structural panels reached record levels 
relative to  average plywood prices and sales volume increased and  respectively 
in contrast  average prices and volumes for our mix of lumber products  which is mostly ponderosa pine appearance and industrial grades  declined 
an unfavorable balance of supply and demand for pine lumber during the first half of the year pushed prices down until late in the third and fourth quarters  which delayed recovery in these grades until later in the year 
in december  we recorded a million pretax charge for the write down of impaired assets at our plywood and lumber operations in yakima  washington 
we also recorded million of tax benefits associated with the write down 
the write down resulted from our internal review of the operations and indications of current market value 
we recorded the write down in other income expense  net and the tax benefits in income tax provision benefit in the consolidated statement of income 
for the year ended december   the write down decreased net income million 
in february  we sold the yakima operations  excluding timberlands 
the impact of this sale was not material to our financial position or to our results of operations 
segment income increased million in  compared with  due primarily to increased structural panel prices  increased building materials distribution sales and favorable wood costs  offset by a pretax charge for the write down of impaired assets at our plywood and lumber operations in yakima  washington 
due to the divestiture of our integrated wood polymer building materials facility near elma  washington  we have restated the and results of operations to exclude the results of this facility s activity in our building solutions segment

boise paper solutions results for represent the ten months of operation before the sale 
boise paper solutions reported income of million for the first ten months of  compared with a loss of million for full year results in were aided by a pretax gain of million on the sale in march of approximately  acres of timberland in western louisiana for million 
we recorded the million pretax gain in other income expense  net 
excluding this gain  the segment lost million in the first ten months of results in  excluding the gain  compare unfavorably with results because of less sales volume as a result of the shorter reporting period in  million of costs and or lost income due to timber and mill damage and lost production at our alabama paper mill related to disruption from hurricanes in september  increased unit manufacturing costs and operating difficulties due to adverse weather conditions and other production issues in first quarter unit manufacturing costs increased during the ten month period in  compared with full year  primarily due to increased fiber costs 
although markets strengthened in  sales for the first ten months of the year were billion  compared with billion for full year total sales volume for the first ten months of was less than sales volume for full year sales and sales volumes declined because of the shorter reporting period in weighted average paper prices increased 
average newsprint and containerboard prices increased per ton and per ton  compared with prices in  while the average price for uncoated free sheet  our largest paper grade  was less per ton than in we took  tons of market related downtime during the first ten months of  compared with  tons during full year the decrease in curtailment in reflects growing market demand and a increase in the amount of office paper sold through the officemax  retail and officemax  contract segments during ten months in  compared with full year sales volumes of value added papers produced on our smaller machines decreased to approximately  tons for the first ten months of  compared with full year volumes declined because of the shorter reporting period in the greatest areas of growth in our value added grades were label  release and specialty papers  whose volume increased during the ten month period in  compared with full year levels 
value added grades generally have higher unit costs than commodity grades but also have higher net sales prices and profit margins 
overall  the average net selling price of our value added grades during the first ten months of was per ton higher than the average net selling price of our uncoated commodity grades 
compared with sales declined in  primarily because weak demand led to a decrease in sales volume 
sales volume decreased despite an increase in the volume of office paper sold through our officemax  retail and officemax  contract segments 
weak demand throughout the year led to market related curtailment of nearly  tons  up from the amount taken in most of the curtailment was taken in uncoated free sheet 
relative to a year earlier  average prices rose only 
higher average newsprint prices were partially offset by lower containerboard prices 
in  we increased production of value added papers on our smaller machines 
the tonnage of value added grades from these machines increased to about  tons 
among our value added grades  the volume of label  release and specialty papers grew in versus the year earlier 
overall  the average net selling price of our value added grades in was per ton higher than the average net selling price of our uncoated commodity grades 
segment results were lower than those of a year ago because of lower unit sales volumes  more market related curtailment and increased unit manufacturing costs 
total unit manufacturing costs increased  compared with a year ago 
in  fiber costs rose  and chemical unit costs increased 
fixed unit costs were also up about 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had billion of cash and cash equivalents and million of short term and long term debt  excluding the billion of timber notes securitized

during  we paid down billion of our debt  primarily with the proceeds of the sale  and expensed million of costs related to the early retirement of debt 
a significant portion of the premiums paid with respect to the debt we paid down was the result of the current low interest rate environment in the market 
in addition  during  we contributed million to our pension plans  including the contributions made to our plans that were spun off in connection with the sale 
we also announced plans to return between million and billion of the proceeds from the sale to shareholders via common or preferred stock buybacks  cash dividends or a combination of these alternatives

the decrease at december   in sold accounts receivable of million from the amount at december   used cash from operations in the increase at december   in sold accounts receivable of million over the amount at december   provided cash from operations in during the period of january through october   some of our employees were covered by noncontributory defined benefit pension plans 
effective july   we spun off the portion of each plan attributable to active employees in the forest products businesses 
effective october   under the terms of the asset purchase agreement with affiliates of boise cascade  llc  we transferred sponsorship of the spun off plans to boise cascade  llc  and only those terminated  vested employees and retirees whose employment with us ended on or before july   and some active officemax  contract employees were covered under the plans remaining with us 
the assets of the pension plans are invested primarily in common stocks  fixed income securities and cash equivalents 
the market performance of these investments affects our recorded pension obligations  expense and cash contributions 
pension expense for the year ended december   was million  including million of curtailment expense related to the sale  compared with million in and million in these are noncash charges in our consolidated financial statements 
in  we made cash contributions to our pension plans totaling million  compared with million in and million in the asset purchase agreement with affiliates of boise cascade  llc  required us to fully fund the transferred spun off plans on an accumulated benefit obligation basis using a liability discount rate 
since our active employees who are covered by the retained plans  as well as all of the inactive participants  are no longer accruing additional benefits  we expect our future contributions to these plans to be greatly reduced 
the minimum required contributions are zero in however  the company may elect to make voluntary contributions

obligations under operating leases are shown in the contractual obligations section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our debt structure consists of credit agreements  note agreements  and other borrowings as follows 
for more information  see contractual obligations and disclosures of financial market risks in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
credit agreements in march  we entered into a three year  unsecured revolving credit agreement 
the agreement permits us to borrow as much as million at variable interest rates based on either the london interbank offered rate libor or the prime rate 
we had no outstanding borrowings under the agreement at december  under the agreement  million of letters of credit were issued and reduced our borrowing capacity to million at december  letters of credit issued under the terms of the revolving credit agreement were charged at a rate of  including the facility fee 
in addition  we were charged a fee of on the unused portion of our revolving credit balance 
we are also charged a utilization fee when we utilize over of our borrowing capacity under the agreement 
at december   we utilized less than of our borrowing capacity 
in november  our interest rate swap to hedge the cash flow risk from the variable interest payments on million of libor based debt expired and was not renewed 
the revolving credit agreement contains customary conditions to borrowing  including compliance with financial covenants relating to minimum net worth  minimum interest coverage ratio and ceiling ratio of debt to capitalization 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
under this agreement  the payment of dividends depends on the existence and amount of net worth in excess of the defined minimum 
our net worth at december   exceeded the defined minimum by  million 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement of million 
in addition to these borrowings  million of letters of credit were issued under the agreement 
when the agreement expires in june  any amount outstanding will be due and payable 
in december  we entered into a month  unsecured credit agreement with major financial institutions 
under the agreement  we borrowed million at variable interest rates based on either the libor or the prime rate 
borrowings under the credit agreement were paid in full on october   with the proceeds from the sale 
timber notes in october  officemax sold its timberlands as part of the sale 
in exchange for the timberlands  we received credit enhanced installment timber notes in the amount of  million which were credit enhanced with guarantees 
the guarantees were issued by financial institutions and were secured by the pledge of underlying collateral notes 
subsequently  in december  we executed a securitization transaction in which  through two bankruptcy remote subsidiaries  we pledged the installment notes and related guarantees and issued securitization notes in the amount of  million 
recourse on the securitization notes is limited to the pledged timber notes 
the timber notes are year non amortizing 
there are two notes that total million bearing interest at payable semiannually and another note in the amount of million bearing interest at payable semiannually 
the securitization notes are also year non amortizing  in two equal million tranches paying interest of and semiannually 
as a result of these transactions  officemax received  million in cash from the bankruptcy remote special purpose entities  will receive approximately million per year in interest income and will have interest expense of approximately million per year for years 
the pledged timber notes and nonrecourse securitization notes will mature in and  respectively 
the securitization notes have an initial term that is approximately three months shorter than the installment notes 
the company expects to refinance its ownership of the installment notes in with a short term secured borrowing to bridge the period from initial maturity of the securitization notes to the maturity of the installment notes 
the guidance related to the accounting for the securitization is complex and open to interpretation 
the entities issuing the installment notes are variable interest entities the vie s under fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the holder of the installment notes is considered to be the primary beneficiary  and therefore  the vie s are consolidated with the securitization note issuers 
although we believe an argument can be made that the consolidation of the vie s as a result of this transaction does not disqualify the securitization note issuers from being qualified special purpose entities qspe as described in fasb statement  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  we have concluded that consolidating the vie s does disqualify the securitization note issuers from meeting this guidance 
as a result  the securitization note issuers are required to consolidate with their ultimate parent  officemax 
note agreements in august  we issued million of medium term notes due in the proceeds of the notes were used for general corporate purposes 
on november   we purchased million of these notes pursuant to a tender offer for these securities 
at december   million was outstanding 
in october  we issued million of senior notes due in and million of senior notes due in net proceeds from the senior notes were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit agreement to provide cash for the officemax  inc transaction and for other general corporate purposes 
see note  officemax  inc  acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data of this form k 
we paid approximately million in fees and expenses associated with the senior notes transaction 
the fees are being amortized over the terms of the senior notes 
at the time of issuance  the senior note indentures contained a number of restrictive covenants 
because of the subsequent transactions described below  substantially all of the restrictive covenants have been eliminated through the execution of supplemental indentures and replaced with covenants found in the base indenture that are applicable to our medium term notes and other public debt 
those covenants include a limitation on mergers and similar transactions  a restriction on secured transactions involving principal properties  as defined  and a restriction on sale and leaseback transactions involving principal properties 
on november   we repurchased approximately million of senior notes and received the requisite consents to adopt amendments to the indenture pursuant to a tender offer for these securities 
as a result  the company and the trustee executed a sixth supplemental indenture which eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants  certain events of default and related provisions and replaced them with the covenants from our other public debt 
on december   both moody s investors service  inc and standard poor s rating services upgraded the credit rating on our senior notes to investment grade 
the upgrades were the result of actions the company undertook to collateralize the notes by granting the noteholders a security interest in million in principal amount of general electric capital and bank of america corp 
notes maturing in the notes subject to the security interest are recorded as a restricted investment on our balance sheet 
as a result of these ratings upgrades  the senior note covenants have been replaced with the covenants found in our other public debt 
adjustable conversion rate equity securities aces in december  we issued  adjustable conversion rate equity security units aces to the public at an aggregate offering price of million 
the units traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol bep 
at the time of issuance  there were two components of each unit 
investors received a preferred security issued by boise cascade trust i the trust  a statutory business trust whose common securities were owned by the company  with a liquidation amount of these preferred securities were mandatorily redeemable in december investors also entered into a contract to purchase  for  common shares of the company  subject to a collar arrangement 
the trust used the proceeds from the offering to purchase debentures issued by boise cascade corporation now officemax incorporated 
these debentures were senior unsecured obligations that matured in december on september   we dissolved the trust and distributed the debentures to the unit holders in exchange for their preferred securities 
also on that date  the remarketing of million of these debentures was completed 
in connection with the remarketing  the interest rate on the debentures was reset to over the average of the rates for three month libor on the third business day before the prior quarter s interest payment date 
the over libor rate will decrease or increase by if at any time standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor service  inc  raise or lower their ratings of the debentures 
the first interest payment on the debentures at the reset rate was made on december   at a rate of per annum 
on november   we repurchased million of these debentures pursuant to an offer to purchase these securities 
we made an open market purchase of an additional million of the debentures in december 
as of december   million of the debentures remained outstanding and are recorded in long term debt  less current portion 
on december   holders of our adjustable conversion rate equity security units received of our common shares upon settlement of each purchase contract resulting in the issuance of a total of  shares 
we received per unit  or million  as a result of the settlement of the purchase contracts 
in december  the fasb issued fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin r  as revised  required us to reclassify the million of aces from minority interest to debt in our consolidated balance sheets and recognize distributions on these securities as interest expense rather than minority interest  net of income tax in our consolidated statements of income loss 
as allowed by the fasb s fin r  prior years financial statements were reclassified 
in all periods presented  there was no net effect on earnings  and the reclassification of these securities to debt did not affect our financial covenants 
other during  we agreed to enter into a million sale leaseback of equipment at our integrated wood polymer building materials facility near elma  washington 
the sale leaseback has a base term of seven years and an interest rate of  was accounted for as a financing arrangement  and is included in long term debt  less current portion in our consolidated balance sheet 
the debentures  issued in october  contain a provision under which  in the event of the occurrence of both a designated event  as defined generally a change of control or a major distribution of assets and a subsequent rating decline  as defined  the holders of these securities may require officemax to redeem the securities 
changes in short term borrowings represent net changes in notes payable 
at december  and  we had million and million of short term borrowings outstanding 
the minimum and maximum amounts of combined short term borrowings outstanding were million and million during the year ended december   and were and million during the year ended december  the average amounts of short term borrowings outstanding during the years ended december  and  were million and million 
the average interest rates for these borrowings were for and for the increase in the maximum and average amounts of short term borrowings outstanding in  compared with  reflect the addition of two million term loan facilities in september to fund incremental contributions to our pension plans and to decrease our accounts receivable financing 
see note  retirement and benefits plans  and note  receivables in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data of this form k 
in addition  during second quarter  we added two million floating rate term loans 
on october   we repaid the two million and two million term loans with the proceeds from the sale 
previously  officemax guaranteed the debt used to fund our employee stock ownership plan esop that was part of the savings and supplemental retirement plan for our us salaried employees 
see note  retirement and benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data of this form k 
the debt was repaid in the debt was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet  with an offset in the shareholders equity section in deferred esop benefit 
we have guaranteed tax indemnities on the esop debt 
although the debt was paid  under these indemnities  we would be required to pay additional amounts to the debt holders if the interest payments on the debt were determined to be taxable 
any amounts paid under this tax indemnification would be dependent upon future tax rulings and assessments by the internal revenue service and are not quantifiable at this time 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations as of december  some of the figures we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties and other factors

the table assumes our long term debt is held to maturity 
b we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
we lease our retail store space as well as other property and equipment under operating leases 
some of our retail store leases require percentage rentals on sales above specified minimums and contain escalation clauses 
these minimum lease payments do not include contingent rental expense 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements

e lease obligations for facility closures are included in operating leases 
in accordance with an amended and restated joint venture agreement  the minority owner of our subsidiary in mexico  officemax de mexico  can elect to put its remaining interest in the subsidiary to officemax if earnings targets are achieved 
at december   officemax de mexico had met these earnings targets 
these earnings targets are calculated quarterly on a rolling four quarter basis 
accordingly  the targets can be achieved in one quarter but not in the next 
if the earnings targets are achieved and the minority owner elects to put its ownership interest  the purchase price would be equal to fair value  calculated based on both the subsidiary s earnings for the last four quarters before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization and the current market multiples of similar companies 
the fair value purchase price in is estimated at to million 
this contingent obligation is not included in the table above 
in addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations quantified in the table above  we have other obligations for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business 
these contracts  however  are either not enforceable or legally binding or are subject to change based on our business decisions 
off balance sheet activities and guarantees we have sold fractional ownership interests in a defined pool of accounts receivable 
we account for this sales program under fasb statement  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
we have entered into this program to provide us funding at rates favorable to our other borrowing arrangements 
under this program  we sell substantially all of our domestic trade accounts receivable on a revolving basis to a fully consolidated  wholly owned subsidiary 
the subsidiary in turn sells a fractional ownership interest in the receivables to affiliates of two banks 
based on the terms of the sale  we record the sales as true sales and not as loans secured by the receivables 
at december   million of sold accounts receivable were excluded from receivables in our consolidated balance sheet 
in connection with the sale  we stopped selling the receivables related to these businesses  reducing the receivables sold as a part of this program at the end of the year 
the portion of fractional ownership interest we retain is included in receivables in our consolidated balance sheet 
a portion of our retained interest is subordinate to the interests of the bank affiliates  providing them credit support if the receivables become uncollectible 
the anticipated impact of the credit support is reflected in our allowance for uncollectible receivables 
the proceeds available under this program could be reduced  based on the level of eligible receivables  restrictions on the concentrations of receivables and the historical performance of the receivables 
the available proceeds may not exceed million under our current agreements 
our costs under this program vary  based on changes in interest rates 
they totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the purchasers of the receivables normally commit to our securitization program in day increments 
in november  we entered into a day renewal of the arrangements  which were subsequently renewed for another day period  which now expires on april  when the current program expires  none of the parties are obligated to renew the arrangement 
our experience over the last five years  however  has been that the parties do renew the arrangement with minimal alterations 
if the program were not renewed  we would seek replacement funding from alternative funding sources 
use of those sources  however  might result in an increase in our interest expense and an increase in both liabilities and assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
guarantees note  commitments and guarantees  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data in this form k describes the nature of our guarantees  including the approximate terms of the guarantees  how the guarantees arose  the events or circumstances that would require us to perform under the guarantees and the maximum potential undiscounted amounts of future payments we could be required to make 
inflationary and seasonal influences we believe that neither inflation nor deflation has had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations  however  there can be no assurance that we will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future 
the company s business is seasonal  with officemax  retail showing a more pronounced seasonal trend than officemax  contract 
sales in the second quarter and summer months are historically the slowest of the year 
sales are stronger during the first  third and fourth quarters that include the important new year office supply restocking month of january  the back to school period and the holiday selling season  respectively 
disclosures of financial market risks our debt is predominantly fixed rate 
at december   the estimated current market value of our debt  based on then current interest rates for similar obligations with like maturities  including the timber notes  was approximately million less than the amount of debt reported in the consolidated balance sheet 
the estimated fair values of our other financial instruments  cash and cash equivalents  receivables and short term borrowings are the same as their carrying values 
in the opinion of management  we do not have any significant concentration of credit risks 
concentration of credit risks with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the wide variety of customers and channels to and through which our products are sold  as well as their dispersion across many geographic areas 
changes in interest and currency rates expose the company to financial market risk 
we occasionally use derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  rate hedge agreements  forward purchase contracts and forward exchange contracts  to hedge underlying debt obligations or anticipated transactions 
we do not use them for trading purposes 
for qualifying hedges  the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swap or underlying debt 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of foreign currency firm commitments and anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and recognized in income as adjustments of carrying amounts when the hedged transactions occur 
unrealized gains and losses on all other forward exchange contracts are included in current period net income loss 
interest rate swaps on october   officemax and its subsidiary  officemax southern company  each entered into an interest rate swap contract with j 
aron company  an affiliate of goldman  sachs co 
the contracts were entered to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the issuance of debt securities by special purpose entities formed by the company 
the special purpose entities hold the billion of year timberland installment notes received in the sale 
the company issued nonrecourse debt from the special purpose entities in order to monetize a significant portion of the value of the notes received 
see the discussion of the timber notes and the monetization and securitization process under the caption liquidity and capital resources in this item the officemax swap was for a notional amount of billion  and the officemax southern company swap was for a notional amount of million 
we paid million to settle the contracts on december   in conjunction with the issuance of the securitized timber notes

additional consideration agreement pursuant to an additional consideration agreement between officemax and boise cascade  llc  related to the sale  we may be required to make substantial cash payments to  or receive substantial cash payments from  boise cascade  llc under the additional consideration agreement  the transaction proceeds may be adjusted upward or downward based on paper prices during the six years following the closing date  subject to annual and aggregate caps 
neither party will be obligated to make a payment in excess of million in any one year under the agreement 
payments are also subject to an aggregate cap of million that declines to million in the fifth year and million in the sixth year 
we calculated our projected future obligation under the additional consideration agreement and accrued million in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we calculated the million based on the net present value of weighted average expected payments using industry paper price projections 
we recorded the accrual as an adjustment to the gain on sale of assets in our consolidated statement of income 
in future periods  we will record the changes in the fair value in our net income loss

we can be found liable under these laws if we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of such substances 
in some cases  this liability may exceed the value of the property itself 
in connection with the sale  environmental liabilites that relate to the operation of the forest products assets prior to the closing of the sale continue to be officemax liabilities 
we have been notified that we are a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla or similar federal and state laws  or have received a claim from a private party  with respect to active sites where hazardous substances or other contaminants are or may be located 
all active sites relate to operations either no longer owned by the company or unrelated to its ongoing operations 
in most cases  we are one of many potentially responsible parties  and our alleged contribution to these sites is relatively minor 
for sites where a range of potential liability can be determined  we have established appropriate reserves 
we believe we have minimal or no responsibility with regard to several other sites 
we cannot predict with certainty the total response and remedial costs  our share of the total costs  the extent to which contributions will be available from other parties  or the amount of time necessary to complete the cleanups 
based on our investigations  our experience with respect to cleanup of hazardous substances  the fact that expenditures will  in many cases  be incurred over extended periods of time  and the number of solvent potentially responsible parties  we do not believe that the known actual and potential response costs will  in the aggregate  materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting estimates the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting estimates as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results 
these estimates require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to estimate matters that are inherently uncertain 
we reviewed the development  selection and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
our current critical accounting estimates are as follows merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at weighted average cost or market 
throughout the year  we perform annual physical inventories at all of our locations 
for periods subsequent to the date of each location s last physical inventory  an allowance for estimated shrinkage is provided based on various factors  including sales volume  the location s historical shrinkage results and current trends 
if actual losses as a result of inventory shrinkage are different than management s estimates  adjustments to the allowance for inventory shrinkage may be required 
we record cost markdowns for inventory not expected to be part of our ongoing merchandise offering 
management estimates the required allowance for future inventory cost markdowns based on historical information regarding product sell through and gross margin rates for similar products 
if actual sell through or gross margin rates for discontinued inventory are different than management s estimates  additional inventory markdowns may be required and gross margin could be adversely impacted 
vendor rebates and allowances we participate in various cooperative advertising and other marketing programs with our vendors 
we also participate in various volume purchase rebate programs that may offer tiered rebates based on reaching defined purchase levels 
for such tiered rebate programs  the company calculates estimated consideration to be received from our vendors based on expected purchases during the rebate program period 
we review sales projections and related purchases on a quarterly basis and adjust the estimated consideration accordingly 
rebates and allowances received from our vendors are deferred in inventory with the cost of the associated product and are recognized as a reduction of materials  labor and other operating expenses when the product is sold  unless the rebates and allowances are linked to a specific incremental cost to sell a vendor s product 
amounts received from vendors that are linked to specific selling and distribution expenses are recognized as a reduction of selling and distribution expenses in the period the expense is incurred 
the terms of the contracts covering these programs can be complex and subject to interpretation 
we provide an allowance  should our interpretation of the contract terms differ from those of our vendors and our vendors seek to recover some of the consideration from us 
management identified a material weakness related to our controls over vendor rebates and allowances 
see item a 
controls and procedures in this form k for additional information related to the material weakness identified by management 
pensions during the period of january through october   some of our employees were covered by noncontributory defined benefit pension plans 
effective july   we spun off the portion of each plan attributable to active employees in the forest products businesses 
effective october   under the terms of the asset purchase agreement with affiliates of boise cascade  llc  we transferred sponsorship of the spun off plans to boise cascade  llc  and only those terminated vested employees and retirees whose employment with us ended on or before july   and some active officemax  contract employees were covered under the plans remaining with us 
the officemax  retail employees  among others  never participated in the pension plans 
the salaried pension plan was closed to new entrants on november   and on december   the benefits of officemax  contract participants were frozen with one additional year of service provided to active officemax  contract employees on january   at a reduced crediting rate 
as a result of the closure  freeze and spin off  our annual pension expense and contributions to the plans going forward will be less than the amounts included in prior periods 
we account for pension expense in accordance with fasb statement  employer s accounting for pensions 
this statement requires us to calculate our pension expense and liabilities using actuarial assumptions  including a discount rate assumption and a long term asset return assumption 
we base our discount rate assumption on the rates of return on high quality bonds currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
we base our long term asset return assumption on the average rate of earnings expected on invested funds 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to pensions is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period  based on the performance of plan assets  actuarial valuations and changes in interest rates  and the effect on our financial position and results of operations could be material 
for the period of january through october   our discount rate assumption was  and our long term asset return assumption was 
as a result of the sale  we settled the pension assets and liabilities for employees in our forest products businesses who became employees of boise cascade  llc the settlement triggered a new measurement date 
for the period of october through december   our discount rate assumption was  and our long term asset return assumption remained at 
using these assumptions  our pension expense was million  including million of curtailment expense related to the sale  following expenses of million and million in and if we had used a estimated discount rate and an expected return on plan assets during all of  our pension expense would have been million  and net income would have decreased approximately million 
if we had used a estimated discount rate and an expected return on plan assets during all of  our expense would have been million  and net income would have decreased million 
for  our discount rate assumption used in the measurement of our net periodic benefit cost is  and our expected return on plan assets is 
using these assumptions  we estimate that our pension expense will be approximately million 
if we were to decrease our estimated discount rate assumption used in the measurement of our net periodic benefit cost to and our expected return on plan assets to  our pension expense would be approximately million 
if we were to increase our discount rate assumption used in the measurement of our net periodic benefit cost to and our expected return on plan assets to  our pension expense would be approximately million 
pension plan contributions include required minimums and  in some years  additional discretionary amounts 
during  we made contributions to our pension plans totaling million  compared with million in and million in there are no minimum contribution requirements in however  the company may elect to make voluntary contributions 
environmental remediation we are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations 
we account for environmental remediation liabilities in accordance with the sop we record liabilities on an undiscounted basis when assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate our environmental liabilities based on various assumptions and judgments  as we cannot predict with certainty the total response and remedial costs  our share of total costs  the extent to which contributions will be available from other parties or the amount of time necessary to complete any remediation 
in making these judgments and assumptions  we consider  among other things  the activity to date at particular sites  information obtained through consultation with applicable regulatory authorities and third party consultants and contractors and our historical experience at other sites that are judged to be comparable 
due to the number of uncertainties and variables associated with these assumptions and judgments and the effects of changes in governmental regulation and environmental technologies  the precision of the resulting estimates of the related liabilities is subject to uncertainty 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to our environmental liabilities 
as additional information becomes known  our estimates may change 
environmental liabilities that relate to the operation of the forest products assets prior to the closing of the sale continue to be liabilities of officemax  in addition to the liabilities related to the active sites referenced in note  legal proceedings and contingencies  in
