item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
all statements in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical are forward looking statements 
all estimates for and later periods of costs  expenses  revenue  savings  future amortization periods and other items are forward looking statements 
statements regarding possible actions or decisions in and later periods by genelabs and other parties  including collaborators and regulatory authorities  are forward looking statements 
actual results may differ from the forward looking statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties that are discussed under risk factors in item and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
shareholders and prospective investors in the company should carefully consider these risk factors 
we disclaim any obligation to update these statements for subsequent events 
genelabs technologies  inc  referred to as genelabs or the company  is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of pharmaceutical products to improve human health 
the company has built drug discovery and clinical development capabilities that can support various research and development projects 
the company is currently concentrating its capabilities on developing a late stage product for lupus  discovering novel compounds that selectively inhibit replication of the hepatitis c virus and advancing preclinical development of compounds from this hepatitis c virus drug discovery program 
during  the following were significant events for genelabs entering into the agreement with tanabe seiyaku co  ltd 
for prestara in japan  the sale of our diagnostics business to mp biomedicals  llc  the withdrawal of our application for marketing authorization for prestara in europe  entering into the agreement with gilead sciences  inc for research and development of nucleoside compounds for hepatitis c infection  the results of our us phase iii clinical trial for prestara which did not meet its endpoints and the subsequent drop in our stock price 
also saw a shift in emphasis and resources from clinical development of prestara to drug discovery efforts in our hepatitis c program 
we also experienced a management change when irene a 
chow retired from her position as our chief executive officer  remaining as chairman  and james ad smith  who had been president  was promoted to also serve as chief executive officer 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the following are critical accounting estimates which are important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations as presented in the financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees where we continue involvement through a collaboration or other obligation is referred to as unearned contract revenue and classified as a liability on the balance sheet 
we amortize unearned contract revenue into contract revenue on the statement of operations over the research or development period instead of recognizing it into income immediately upon receipt 
we base the amortization period for each agreement on our estimate of the period we have significant obligations under the contract 
we continually review the basis for our estimates  and we may change the estimates if circumstances change 
these changes can significantly increase or decrease the amount of revenue recognized in the financial statements 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate the revenue among the deliverables based on objective and reliable evidence of each deliverable s fair value 
unearned contract revenue at december  was from three different sources 
genelabs management considers the amortization periods for each of the up front payments as critical accounting estimates 
at december   the largest component of unearned contract revenue was related to an up front payment from gilead sciences  inc under a research collaboration and license agreement we entered into in we received an up front payment of million that we are amortizing over the four year period from the effective date of the collaboration 
the four year period is based on the initial three year term of our research obligations to gilead plus an additional one year extension  which is at gilead s sole option 
as of december   million of unearned contract revenue was related to the up front payment received from gilead  of which million was classified as current 
in addition to the up front payment  gilead is also obligated to pay us on going research funding 
before december   gilead paid us million for research to be performed in the first quarter of  which we have classified as deferred revenue  all of which is current 
at december   genelabs also has unearned contract revenue aggregating million related to two separate agreements for prestara  genelabs investigational drug for lupus 
we classified as current approximately million of the unearned contract revenue for these agreements 
we amortize the two up front payments we received over the estimated development terms for prestara for the territories covered by each of the agreements 
genelabs management believes that its significant obligations under the agreements extend to the time when regulatory decisions are made to approve prestara in the key licensed territory  if prestara were to be approved  or until further development of prestara is terminated 
for each of the agreements related to prestara  genelabs is amortizing the unearned contract revenue through december  in all of the agreements for which we have recorded deferred revenue  the estimated period for amortization has an important impact on the revenue we recognize  and  in turn  on the net loss we report in our financial statements 
for example  if longer terms were estimated our revenue would be lower and our net loss would be higher 
conversely  if a shorter amortization term were estimated  our revenue would be greater and the net loss lower 
we regularly assess the remaining terms over which the up front payments are being recognized into the statement of operations and  if appropriate  make changes based on updated information 
for example  in we lengthened the amortization period for the unearned contract revenue related to the agreement with watson pharmaceuticals after our us clinical trial for prestara to did not succeed in meeting its clinical endpoints 
the failure of the clinical trial to meet its endpoints will result in a longer period of time for us to potentially receive approval of prestara  and our best current estimate is that it may now take until the end of our estimate is based on the assumption that another clinical trial may be needed to obtain approval 
however  because we have not met with the us food and drug administration  or fda  to discuss the clinical trial results from our us trial and we do not yet know the results from our open label follow on clinical trial or from a different clinical trial of prasterone that is being conducted by a licensee in taiwan  we presently are unable to define the best course for future development of prestara  or whether we should terminate further development 
therefore  the estimates are highly subjective and may change in the future once we have more information and determine our plans for future development of prestara 
we have assessed the remaining term over which each of the up front payments are being recognized into the statement of operations  and believe we are using the most appropriate terms based on the facts known to us as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k 
however  actions taken by the fda  decisions made by our collaborators or other changes in circumstances after the filing of this annual report on form k may either reduce or lengthen the remaining period over which genelabs records unearned contract revenue into the statement of operations 
accounting for employee stock options 
as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  referred to as sfas  we have elected to continue to apply the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock option plans 
accordingly  we generally account for employee stock options based on their intrinsic value and do not recognize compensation expense for employee options granted at fair market value or higher 
in the notes to our financial statements we separately disclose the pro forma effects on reported net loss and loss per share as if compensation expense had been recognized based on the fair value method of accounting using the black scholes option pricing model 
in valuing our options  we make assumptions about risk free interest rates  dividend yields  volatility and weighted average expected lives of the options 
genelabs management believes that these estimates are subjective  and notes that changes in any of these assumptions  particularly the volatility assumption  would increase or decrease the accounting value of the option and correspondingly increase or decrease the pro forma effect on the disclosures of reported net loss and loss per share under the fair value method 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas r  which supercedes previous accounting rules covering stock options issued to employees 
for genelabs  sfas r is scheduled to become effective with the quarterly reporting period beginning july  under sfas r  we will be required to record compensation expense for stock options issued to employees  based on an estimate of the fair value of the options when they are issued 
because the stock option valuation assumptions permitted under sfas r are different than those contained in sfas  the stock option valuation disclosures contained in the footnotes to our financial statements may differ significantly from the valuations we record in the financial statements upon the adoption of sfas r in the third quarter of we are currently evaluating which method we will use to adopt sfas r 
regardless of the method we choose  we expect sfas r to increase our operating expenses  which will have a material impact on our statement of operations 
results of operations years ended december  and introduction 
genelabs net loss was million in  a decrease of million from the million net loss in this decrease in net loss was primarily the result of higher contract revenue  lower research and development costs and a gain on the sale of a discontinued operation 
a more detailed discussion of the changes in genelabs statement of operations follows 
revenue 
revenues were million in and million in the following table breaks down revenue by major source dollars in thousands contract revenue linker aided dna amplification license fees affymetrix  inc  hcv drug discovery research collaboration gilead sciences  inc prestara collaborations watson pharmaceuticals  inc and tanabe seiyaku co  ltd 
  hepatitis e vaccine milestone glaxosmithkline data analysis services total contract revenue   royalties total revenue   in  our most significant single source of revenue was from our linker aided dna amplification technology  comprised of a license amendment fee of million and royalties of  or a total of  this compares to license fees of  and royalties of  totaling  in the increase in compared to occurred primarily because our licensee  affymetrix  inc  paid us million in december in exchange for receiving a fully paid up license without future royalty obligations 
we recognized the full amount we received as revenue because we have no significant future obligations to affymetrix under the agreement 
we do not expect to recognize any revenue from our agreement with affymetrix during or thereafter 
our research collaboration and license agreement with gilead sciences  inc provided the second most significant source of revenue for the agreement has a three year research term  which gilead has an option to extend for an additional year 
we received an million up front payment upon signing the agreement  and are entitled to receive quarterly payments  in advance  aggregating approximately million over the initial three year research term as we work with gilead to discover additional nucleoside compounds that inhibit replication of hcv 
if gilead exercises its option to extend the research term by one year  additional payments would be due to genelabs 
the agreement began in october  and under the agreement we recognized contract revenue of million for  comprised of million for the pro rata share of the million up front license fee and million in research funding for the fourth quarter of in we also recognized million in revenue from our two collaborations for development and commercialization of prestara 
these are with watson pharmaceuticals inc for north america and tanabe seiyaku co  ltd 
for japan 
in  our revenue related to prestara decreased by million compared to primarily due to a lengthening of the term we estimate it could take us to potentially obtain approval of prestara in the united states 
our lengthening of the estimated term to potentially receive approval in the united states was made based on negative clinical trial results received in  and our determination that approval would not be possible by the june time through which we were previously recognizing revenue 
the decrease in contract revenue recognized under the agreement with watson more than offset the incremental revenue recognized for a new agreement entered into during with tanabe seiyaku for the development and commercialization of prestara in japan 
for both agreements related to prestara  we presently are amortizing the up front payments through the end of the amortization for both agreements could change based on further clinical trial results and possible discussions with the fda 
in  glaxosmithkline  or gsk  paid us a million milestone based on the results of a clinical trial the walter reed army institute of research conducted in collaboration with gsk for a hepatitis e virus vaccine that gsk is developing under license from genelabs 
we recognized as revenue the full amount of the milestone we received because we have no further significant obligations to gsk 
we presently do not expect to recognize any additional revenue under the agreement with gsk until regulatory filings are made in specified countries 
revenue from data analysis services we have performed for other pharmaceutical companies declined to million in from million in because we chose to stop providing these services during the latter part of we do not expect to recognize further revenues from data analysis services 
in addition  we receive various royalties from other parties  which  excluding the royalty from affymetrix  aggregated approximately million in both and operating expenses 
the following table breaks down operating expenses into the two major categories of costs in our financial statements dollars in thousands 
change research and development   general and administrative   total operating expenses   all operating expenses are related to genelabs business of discovering and developing pharmaceutical products 
the two key decreases in operating expenses for compared to were lower costs from conducting our clinical trial of prestara for lupus and lower costs incurred for our employees incentive bonuses 
these are each explained in more detail below 
research and development expenses background because we are in the business of drug discovery and development and have not developed any products that have been approved for sale  we classify the majority of our costs as research and development and expense them as incurred 
research and development expenses include related salaries and benefits  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract and outside service fees  supplies and chemicals used in laboratories and allocated facilities and overhead costs 
over the last ten years  genelabs directed the majority of its research and development toward two major projects developing prestara tm as an investigational new drug for lupus and discovery of entirely new drugs 
research and development expenses by project in  million of operating expenses were in research and development  compared to million in  a decrease of million for as compared to the following table breaks down the research and development expenses by major project dollars in thousands change drug development prestara tm   drug discovery hcv   support costs and other r d   total research and development   drug development prestara tm costs for prestara decreased to million in compared to million in  primarily as a result of a decreased average number of patients under treatment in our phase iii clinical trial  which completed enrollment in february this decrease was partially offset by higher costs incurred for a month open label follow on clinical trial for patients that elected to continue participation  although the per patient costs in the open label trial are lower than in the phase iii clinical trial 
in addition  genelabs incurred lower costs related to the qualification of a manufacturing site for prestara 
genelabs began developing prestara tm for systemic lupus erythematosus in when genelabs licensed exclusive rights to patents related to prestara from stanford university 
to develop this investigational new drug  we have built internal clinical development capabilities including clinical trial design  monitoring  analysis and reporting  regulatory affairs and quality control and assurance 
direct costs incurred to build these capabilities and advance prestara to its current stage of development have been approximately million through december  for we currently expect our costs for drug development to decrease by approximately million  or  compared to due to staff attrition and because the us double blind phase iii clinical trial completed in future development of prestara for lupus and the costs we incur will depend on a number of factors 
these include the results of a clinical trial by a licensee in taiwan  discussions with and actions by the fda  actions involving regulatory authorities in europe and other countries and actions by our prestara collaborators 
in the event we decide to discontinue development of prestara in  we do not expect to realize further significant savings for as we have agreements in place with our clinical investigators  service providers and consultants for services we expect to require even if prestara development is terminated 
also  any savings from reducing clinical development staff would be partially offset by severance costs 
drug discovery costs for our drug discovery program increased to million in from million in drug discovery costs were modestly higher in compared to largely due to higher personnel costs and additional research materials used during since initiating its first drug discovery program in  genelabs has built medicinal chemistry  combinatorial chemistry  computational modeling  molecular biology  assay development and high throughput screening  drug metabolism  pharmacokinetics and toxicology capabilities 
genelabs has incurred direct drug discovery costs of approximately million through december  in  substantially all of our drug discovery efforts were directed towards our two hepatitis c virus hcv research programs  both of which are concentrated on identifying a new drug to combat infection with hcv 
the two current programs are both targeting the hcv rna dependent rna polymerase  the enzyme directly responsible for replication of the hcv genome  although through different mechanisms 
part of our drug discovery process includes testing of our preclinical drug candidates and identification of additional potential lead compounds 
due to the nature of drug discovery research  we cannot reliably estimate the outcome of scientific experiments  many of which will impact the design and conduct of subsequent scientific experiments  and all of which provide additional information on both the direction of the research program and likelihood of its success 
as such  the potential timing for key future events that may occur in our drug discovery programs cannot reliably be estimated and we cannot estimate whether a compound will advance to a later stage of development or when we may determine that a program is no longer viable for potentially producing a drug candidate 
we also cannot reasonably predict the costs to reach these stages  and cannot predict whether any of our compounds will result in commercial products or lead to revenue for the company 
during  we entered into a license and research collaboration with gilead that is currently providing a source of revenue to support the hcv nucleoside program we previously funded ourselves 
the agreement requires us to commit a specified number of scientists to the hcv nucleoside program  at approximately the same level we had previously devoted to the program  so we do not expect costs in for that research program to increase appreciably as a result of the new agreement 
however  we plan to expand work on our other existing hcv drug discovery program and introduce new drug discovery programs  and therefore presently estimate that drug discovery costs for will increase by over compared to  if we are able to hire the additional scientists required for such programs 
however  the resources available to us  outcomes of current and planned scientific experiments and outcomes of corporate partnering discussions may cause us to revise this estimate 
management continually evaluates the status of our drug discovery research programs and expects to continue to devote resources toward these efforts  while at the same time managing the level of expenditures to balance advancement of potential product candidates against genelabs limited cash resources and the potential cash requirements for development of prestara 
support costs and other r d support costs and other r d is primarily comprised of costs necessary to maintain a research and development facility  such as rent  support staff  maintenance and utilities  and the incentive bonus  all allocated based on the headcount ratio between research and development and general and administrative 
support costs and other r d were million in and million in  a decrease of million 
the following table breaks down by percentage the major components of support costs and other r d facility rent insurance and depreciation incentive bonus allocation utilities  maintenance and security support staff other items total support and other r d costs the decrease in costs during as compared to was primarily due to a reduction of the incentive bonus allocation due to significant contingencies that were established for the payment of bonuses relating to the year  which were met in late and resulted in a higher charge for other costs included in support costs and other r d were comparable in and in the table above  the percentage for items other than the incentive bonus allocation increases due to the decline in the incentive bonus percentage 
in  we expect support costs and other r d to increase approximately to in order to support planned higher direct drug discovery research activities 
general and administrative in both and  million of our operating expenses were general and administrative expenses 
these expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for executive management  finance  legal  business development  human resources and marketing departments  as well as professional expenses  such as legal and audit  and allocated facilities costs such as rent and insurance 
during  higher general and administrative costs were incurred for audit and legal fees  mostly related to new regulations covering public companies and higher patent costs due to our filing more patent applications arising from our hcv drug discovery program 
the increase in these audit and legal fees in offset decreases in the allocation of the incentive bonus to general and administrative expenses after contingencies were met during  increasing the costs for requirements for future general and administrative expenses will vary based on future events that impact our business  such as the requirements for further development of prestara  if any 
management currently expects our general and administrative expenses may increase by up to compared to the general and administrative expenses  if the results of the taiwan clinical trial are positive and the fda agrees to review the data  as we may elect to expand marketing and business development activities related to prestara 
if we decide to discontinue development of prestara  we expect that marketing and business development activities related to prestara will be reduced but these savings may be offset by severance costs  legal costs and redirection of management to other corporate priorities such as increased emphasis on partnering our research programs 
nonoperating expenses 
interest income was million in  an increase of million from due to higher average cash balances during and higher average interest rates 
in  we recorded million in a gain on sale of our discontinued operations and income from its operations compared to million in for income from its operations 
because the gain on sale was recorded during  the income from discontinued operations was higher in than in years ended december  and introduction 
genelabs net loss was million in  an increase of million from the million net loss in this increase in net loss is primarily the result of higher research and development costs during research and development costs were higher in due to commencement of the clinical trial in women with lupus and also due to higher incentive bonus costs that were incurred as a result meeting contingencies established for payment of the incentives 
partially offsetting these increases were lower salary and benefit costs resulting from a reduction in workforce implemented in early a more detailed discussion of the changes in genelabs statement of operations follows 
revenue 
revenues were million in  a decrease of million from million in revenues in the following table breaks down revenue by major source dollars in thousands contract revenue prestara collaboration with watson   license fees data analysis services total contract revenue   royalties total revenue   in  approximately of revenue was the recognition into income of a previously received up front license payment from watson 
in  this source of revenue decreased from due to a revision we made to the estimate of time it would take us to obtain an answer from the fda on approval of prestara tm after our possible submission of a complete response to the approvable letter 
as of december   genelabs estimated that it would take until june for an fda decision on the nda based on the scheduled completion of the clinical trial conducted in the us as noted above  in we changed this estimate to aside from the revenue recognized from watson  other sources of revenue include royalties and license fees and data analysis services performed for larger pharmaceutical companies 
collectively  these other sources aggregated approximately million in both and operating expenses 
the following table breaks down operating expenses into the two major categories of costs on our financial statements dollars in thousands change research and development   general and administrative   total operating expenses   all operating expenses are related to genelabs business of discovering and developing pharmaceutical products 
the two key increases in operating expenses for compared to were costs related to conducting our clinical trial of prestara for lupus and costs incurred for our employees incentive bonuses 
these are each explained in more detail below 
research and development expenses by project the following table breaks down the research and development expenses by major project dollars in thousands change drug development prestara tm   drug discovery hcv and dna binding   support costs and other r d   total research and development   drug development prestara tm costs for prestara increased to million in compared to million in primarily as a result of our commencement of the phase iii clinical trial  which enrolled patients throughout in addition  genelabs also incurred additional incremental costs in for qualification of a manufacturing site for prestara 
drug discovery costs for our drug discovery program decreased to million in from million in drug discovery costs were lower in compared to because of a reduction in the drug discovery workforce that was implemented in early support costs and other r d support costs and other r d were million in and million in  an increase of million 
the following table breaks down by percentage the major components of support costs and other r d facility rent insurance and depreciation incentive bonus allocation utilities  maintenance and security support staff other items total support and other r d costs the million increase in costs during was primarily due to an increased incentive bonus allocation incurred in as compared to no incentive bonus allocation in  under an incentive bonus plan in which all employees participate 
no bonus charge was incurred in due to contingencies our board of directors established for the payment  which were not met until in addition  we modified our facility lease at the end of  also increasing the support and other r d costs approximately million in other costs included in support costs and other r d decreased in as compared to  both in total dollars and as a percentage of the total support and other r d costs  as a result of facility improvements becoming fully depreciated at the end of and our reduction in workforce 
general and administrative in  million in operating expenses were general and administrative expenses  compared to million in  an increase of million 
during  higher general and administrative costs were incurred due to recording of costs for incentive bonuses in compared to no charge in  as during we met board determined contingencies required prior to the payment of the incentive bonuses 
meeting these contingencies increased general and administrative costs by million in compared to offsetting this increase were lower salary costs as a result of the reduction in workforce implemented in early nonoperating expenses 
interest income was million in  a decrease of million from the decrease in interest income was due to lower average cash balances during than during in  we recorded million in income from the discontinued operations of genelabs diagnostics pte 
ltd  an increase of million from million in income for the increase in income from discontinued operations was primarily due to higher sales of diagnostics products 
liquidity and capital resources we assess liquidity primarily by the cash and cash equivalents available to fund our operations 
genelabs had cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash of million at december   which was no change from the cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash at december  in  our cash used in operations was million  which funded our development of prestara and our continued research on the discovery of new treatments for hepatitis c virus infection 
the cash used in operations during was reduced by the following nonrecurring events during the year million upfront payment received from gilead sciences  inc for a license and research collaboration agreement for discovery of new drugs for hepatitis c viral infections  million upfront payment received from tanabe seiyaku for a license and collaboration agreement for the japanese rights to prestara  million received from an amendment to a license agreement with affymetrix for our linker aided dna amplification technology  and a milestone payment of million received from glaxosmithkline based on the results of a phase ii clinical trial of their investigational vaccine for the hepatitis e virus 
during  our million cash used in operations and our million in purchases of property and equipment were offset by million in cash received from the sale of our diagnostics business  million in cash received from the sale of common stock to our japanese licensee for prestara and million in cash received from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
genelabs presently estimates that our current cash resources will be adequate to provide liquidity into approximately mid however  we will require additional capital to carry out our business plans in and expect to continue to rely on outside sources of financing to meet our capital needs 
the company is considering entering into additional research collaborations  such as for our hepatitis c virus drug discovery program which is separate from our collaboration with gilead 
we are also evaluating the sale of non core assets and exploring other potential partnerships as sources of funding 
the company may be unable to complete any of these transactions as currently contemplated or at all 
since genelabs inception  the company has operated at a loss and has funded operations primarily through public and private offerings of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  contract revenues 
we expect to incur substantial additional costs  including research costs for drug discovery and development costs for prestara 
the amount of additional costs in our business plans will depend on numerous factors including the outcome of the clinical trial in taiwan  whether the fda will consider the data from taiwan  any other fda actions  the progress of our research and development programs and the actions of corporate collaborators 
to meet our capital needs we will require additional funding  but additional funds may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
the unavailability of additional funds could delay or prevent the development  approval or marketing of some or all of our products and technologies  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
other contractual arrangements 
genelabs principal research  clinical development and office facilities are leased from third parties under operating leases 
as such  genelabs expenses its facility rental costs over the terms of the respective leases as those costs are incurred 
all biotechnology companies in california that use radioactive materials must provide a means of assurance to the state that radioactive waste will be cleaned up in the event the facility is abandoned 
genelabs has provided this assurance by establishing a  standby letter of credit in favor of the radiologic health branch of the california department of health services 
the letter of credit is secured by a certificate of deposit of  which is classified as restricted cash 
there are no contractual financial obligations that extend beyond the next five years  although we have an option to extend our principal current operating lease for a four year period beyond its current expiration in november our contractual payment obligations for the next five years are as follows less than one year one to three years three to five years total in thousands operating leases    equipment loans total    item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk genelabs exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s short term investments 
we consider the risk minimal as substantially all investments are in money market funds and we have not used derivative instruments 
as of december   the overall average maturity of genelabs short term investment portfolio was less than days  leaving little exposure to changes in interest rates 
genelabs exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the company s investment in a taiwan based biopharmaceutical company  genovate biotechnology co  ltd  which is accounted for at cost  based on the lower of cost or market value method 
this investment is the only item included in the balance sheet caption long term investments 
genelabs may attempt to divest a portion of this investment  in which case changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the proceeds received upon sale of these shares 
because the book value of genelabs ownership percentage of genovate is greater than our carrying cost  we currently do not believe that any foreign currency exchange rate changes would impact the value of this investment as reported in the financial statements unless the value of a taiwan dollar depreciates by greater than compared to the us dollar  which  depending on other circumstances  might require genelabs to record a non cash charge to write down the long term investment 
the genovate shares owned by genelabs currently are not transferable and we cannot predict when or if the shares will be transferable and at what price  if any
