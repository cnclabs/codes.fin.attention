industry overview we compete in the us automotive aftermarket industry  which has annual sales in excess of billion 
this industry includes replacement parts excluding tires  accessories  maintenance items  batteries and automotive fluids for cars and light trucks 
the industry is comprised of the diy market and the 
table of contents difm market 
we believe that the us automotive aftermarket industry is characterized by stable demand and is growing because of increases in the size and age of automotive vehicles in use  the number of miles driven annually per vehicle  the number of licensed drivers  the percentage of the total light vehicle fleet represented by light trucks including suvs  which generate higher average aftermarket product purchases versus such purchases generated per car  and the number of light vehicles coming off warranty  particularly leased vehicles  which we believe are often under maintained and  therefore  may require higher than average maintenance and repair expenditures in the post warranty period 
while consolidation of automotive aftermarket retailers continues to occur  the industry remains highly fragmented 
our primary competitors include national and regional automotive parts chains  wholesalers  jobber stores  independent operators  automobile dealers  and discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products 
competitive strengths and strategies we believe that our competitive strengths and strategies include the following leading market position in the western united states 
we are the largest specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories in the western united states and have the number one market position in of the geographic markets in which we operate  based on store count 
we believe that we have better brand name recognition than many of our competitors due to the long operating history of our stores  our advertising and marketing programs  the breadth of our product selection and our reputation for superior customer service 
as the largest specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories in the western united states  we believe we have certain competitive advantages over smaller retail chains and independent operators 
these advantages include our brand name recognition as a trusted source of automotive parts and accessories  our ability to make available a broad selection of products on a timely basis  marketing and distribution efficiencies due to economies of scale  and our advanced store level information and distribution systems  which are the result of our significant investments in recent years 
we also believe that we enjoy a competitive advantage over mass merchandisers due to our focus on automotive parts and accessories and our knowledgeable sales associates 
focus on customer service 
as part of our promise of great service  our internally developed customer service initiative  we aim to provide the highest level of customer service in our industry in order to generate repeat business 
recruiting  training and retaining high quality sales associates is a major component of our focus on customer service 
our training programs and incentives encourage our sales associates to develop technical expertise  which enables them to effectively advise customers on product selection and use 
we have an average of two national institute for automotive service excellence  or ase  certified parts professionals per store 
to further satisfy our customers needs  we also offer free testing of certain parts  no hassle return policies  electronically maintained warranties and a customer service call center 
sophisticated store level information and distribution systems 
in recent years  we have made significant investments in sophisticated store level information systems and warehouse and distribution systems in order to more effectively manage our inventory and increase the availability of products to our customers 
our sophisticated inventory management systems provide inventory movement forecasting based on history  trends and seasonality 
our systems have enhanced our ability to predict the size and timing of product requirements by closely monitoring service level goals  vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions 
our store level replenishment system generates orders based upon store on hand and store model stock quantities 
store model stock quantities are determined by an automatic model stock adjustment system that utilizes historical sales patterns  seasonality and store presentation requirements 
our fully integrated 
table of contents warehouse and distribution network and our strategically located depots  which operate using state of the art technology  have allowed us to significantly improve distribution efficiency 
in addition  these investments have allowed us to both improve our in stock inventory levels and reduce delivery costs and times for products 
we also maintain a store specific precision pricing program that seeks to optimize margins while maintaining price competitiveness 
our pricing philosophy is that we should not lose a customer because of price 
our pricing strategy is to offer everyday competitive prices at each of our stores 
as a result  we closely monitor our competitors pricing levels through our precision pricing program  which analyzes prices at the store level rather than at the market or chain level 
this initiative enables us to establish pricing levels at each store based upon that store s local market competition 
our entry level products offer excellent value by meeting standard quality requirements at low prices 
in addition  our sales associates are encouraged to offer alternative products at slightly higher price points 
these products typically provide extra features  improved performance  an enhanced warranty  or are nationally branded items 
drive customer traffic and increase sales base 
our marketing and merchandising strategy is designed to drive customer traffic and build market share 
our strategy is to make available to our customers one of the broadest selections of quality brand name products on a timely basis in order to maximize customer satisfaction and generate loyal repeat customers 
we also strive to be the industry leader in introducing new and innovative product offerings  supported by our week promotional print advertising programs that includes color circulars and newspaper advertisements 
we offer our products at competitive prices  in conveniently located and attractively designed stores 
our advertising programs are specifically tailored to target our various customer constituencies for maximum appeal and effectiveness 
highly experienced and proven management team 
we are led by an innovative management team with a wealth of automotive aftermarket and retail industry experience 
maynard jenkins  our chairman and chief executive officer  has served in his current position since january and has years of retail management experience  including years as a chief executive officer 
martin fraser  our president and chief operating officer  has been with us for years  serving in a number of key positions prior to his current role  including executive vice president merchandising  distribution and commercial and sr 
vice president merchandising  transportation  replenishment and marketing 
our senior management team averages over years of retail industry experience 
we believe the strength and experience of our management team has enabled us to deliver exceptional operating and financial results and to emerge as a leader in our highly competitive industry 
store operations our stores are divided into nine geographic regions southwest  rocky mountain  northwest  northern plains  southern california  coastal california  los angeles  bay area and northern california 
a regional manager  each of whom oversees seven to eleven district managers  administers each region 
each of our district managers has responsibility for between and stores 

table of contents the table below sets forth  as of january   the geographic distribution of our stores and the trade names under which they operate 
checker schucks kragen company auto parts auto supply auto parts total california washington arizona colorado minnesota oregon utah nevada idaho wisconsin new mexico texas alaska montana wyoming hawaii north dakota south dakota michigan total our stores are generally open seven days a week  with hours from am to am am to am on sundays 
the average store employs approximately to employees  including a store manager  two assistant store managers and a staff of full time and part time associates 
store formats approximately of our stores are freestanding  with the balance principally located within strip shopping centers 
the stores  which range in size from  to  square feet  average approximately  square feet in size and offer a store specific mix of between  and  skus 
we have three prototype store designs  which are   and  square feet in size 
the store size for a given new location is selected generally based upon sales volume expectations determined through demographics and the detailed market analysis that we prepare as part of our site selection process 
the following table categorizes our stores by size  as of january  store size number of stores  sq

table of contents approximately to of the square footage in each store is selling space  of which approximately to is dedicated to automotive replacement parts inventory 
the replacement parts inventory area is staffed with knowledgeable parts personnel and is equipped with our electronic parts catalog 
the remaining selling space contains gondolas for accessories and maintenance items  including oil and air filters  additives  waxes and other items  together with specifically designed shelving for batteries and  in many stores  oil products 
real estate strategy our real estate strategy is focused on our existing or contiguous markets and includes opening new stores  relocating under performing stores with expiring leases to better locations  and expanding selected stores 
our real estate department utilizes a sophisticated  market based approach that identifies and analyzes potential store locations based on detailed demographic and competitive studies 
these demographic and competitive studies include analysis of population density  growth patterns  age  per capita income  vehicle traffic counts and the number and type of existing automotive related facilities  such as automotive parts stores and other competitors within a pre determined radius of the potential new location 
these potential locations are compared to our existing locations to determine opportunities for opening new stores and relocating or expanding existing stores 
the following table sets forth our store development activities during the periods indicated fiscal year beginning stores new stores relocated stores closed stores including relocated stores ending stores expanded stores total new  relocated and expanded stores we expect to open or relocate approximately stores in fiscal store merchandising our store merchandising program  which classifies our product mix into separate categories  is designed to determine the optimal inventory mix at each individual store based on that store s historical sales 
we believe that we can improve store sales  gross profit margin and inventory turnover by tailoring individual store inventory mix based on historical sales patterns for each of the product categories 
purchasing merchandise is selected from over suppliers and purchased for all stores by personnel at our corporate headquarters in phoenix  arizona 
no one class of product and no single supplier accounted for as much as of our purchases in fiscal years   or our inventory management systems include the e trim buying system  which provides inventory movement forecasting based upon history  trend and seasonality 
combined with service level goals  vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions  the e trim buying system determines the timing and size of purchase orders 
the vast majority of the dollar values of transactions are sent via electronic data interchange  
table of contents with the remainder being sent by a computerized email or facsimile interface 
our store replenishment system generates orders based upon store on hand and store model stock 
this includes an automatic model stock adjustment system utilizing historical sales  seasonality and store presentation requirements 
we also can allocate seasonal and promotional merchandise based upon a store s history of prior promotional and seasonal sales 
our stores offer products with nationally recognized  well advertised brand names  such as armor all  autolite  castrol  dayco  fel pro  fram  havoline  mobil  monroe  pennzoil  prestone  quaker state  raybestos  stant  sylvania  turtle wax and valvoline 
in addition to brand name products  our stores carry a wide variety of high quality generic products 
because nationally recognized manufacturers that produce similar brand name products that enjoy a high degree of consumer acceptance produce most of our generic products  we believe that our generic products are of a quality that is comparable to such brand name products 
commercial sales program in addition to our primary focus on serving the diy consumer  we have significantly increased our marketing directed at the commercial or difm customer in the automotive replacement parts market 
the commercial or difm market constitutes in excess of of the annual sales in the automotive aftermarket and is currently growing at a faster rate than the diy market 
our commercial sales program  which is intended to facilitate penetration of this market  is targeted toward professional mechanics  auto repair shops  auto dealers  fleet owners  mass and general merchandisers with auto repair facilities and other commercial repair outlets located near our stores 
we have made a significant commitment to this portion of our business and upgraded the information systems capabilities available to the commercial sales group 
in addition  we employ one district sales manager for approximately every five stores with a commercial sales center 
this district sales manager is responsible for servicing existing and developing new  commercial accounts 
in addition  at a minimum  each commercial sales center has a dedicated in store salesperson  driver and delivery vehicle 
we believe we are well positioned to effectively and profitably service commercial customers  who typically require a higher level of customer service and broad product availability 
the commercial market has traditionally been serviced primarily by jobbers 
however  automotive specialty retailing chains  such as csk auto  inc  have continued to increase their share of the commercial market 
the chains typically have multiple locations in given market areas and maintain a broad inventory selection 
we believe we have significant competitive advantages in servicing the commercial market because of our experienced sales associates  conveniently located stores  attractive pricing and ability to consistently deliver a broad product offering with an emphasis on national brand names 
as of january   we operated commercial service centers in of our stores 
our sales to commercial accounts including sales by stores without commercial service centers were million in both fiscal and fiscal on a comparable store basis  commercial sales increased in fiscal over fiscal advertising we support our marketing and merchandising strategy primarily through print advertising  in store promotional displays and radio and television advertising 
the print advertising consists of color circulars and newspaper advertisements that are produced by our in house advertising department 
we also advertise on radio  television and billboards primarily to reinforce our image and name recognition 
television advertising is primarily targeted to sports programming and radio advertising is primarily aired during commuting hours 
advertising efforts include spanish language television and radio as well as bilingual store signage 
in store signs and displays are used to promote products  identify departments  and to announce store specials 
we also sponsor major league baseball in major markets throughout our trade area and two national hot rod

associates as of january   we employed approximately  full time associates and approximately  part time associates 
approximately of our personnel are employed in store level operations  in distribution and in our corporate headquarters  including our call center and priority parts operation 
we have never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that our labor relations are good 
except for a limited number of associates located at certain stores in the northern california market  who have been represented by a union for many years  none of our personnel are represented by a labor union 
competition we compete in both the diy and difm markets of the automotive aftermarket industry  which is highly fragmented and generally very competitive 
we compete primarily with national and regional retail automotive parts chains such as autozone  inc and the pep boys manny  moe and jack  inc  wholesalers or jobber stores some of which are associated with national automotive parts distributors or associations  such as napa  automobile dealers  and discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive replacement parts  maintenance items and accessories such as wal mart stores  inc 
as the largest specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories in the western united states  we believe we have certain competitive advantages over smaller retail chains and independent operators 
these advantages include our brand name recognition as a trusted source of automotive parts and accessories  our ability to make available a broad selection of products on a timely basis  marketing and distribution efficiencies achieved from economies of scale  and our advanced store level information and distribution systems  which are the result of our significant investments in recent years 
we also believe that we enjoy a competitive advantage over mass merchandisers due to our focus on automotive parts and accessories and our knowledgeable sales associates 
the principal competitive factors that affect our business are store location  customer service and product selection  availability  quality and price 
while we believe that we compete effectively in our various markets  certain competitors are larger in terms of number of stores and sales volume  have greater financial and management resources and have been operating longer in certain geographic areas 
trade names  service marks and trademarks we have the right to exclusively use the trade name checker nationwide in connection with the automotive parts retailing business pursuant to a settlement and use agreement with the owner of the federal registration for such trademark 
we own and have registered the service mark schuck s with the united states patent and trademark office for use in connection with the automotive parts retailing business 
we recently renewed the registration for this mark for an additional ten year period 
we have common law rights to use the trade name kragen in connection with the automotive parts retailing business 
in addition  we own and have registered numerous trademarks with respect to many of our private label products and advertising and marketing strategies 
we believe that our various trade names  service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy  but that our business is not otherwise dependent on any particular service mark  trade name or trademark 
there are no infringing uses known by us that materially affect the use of such items 

table of contents warehouse and distribution our warehouse and distribution system utilizes bar coding  radio frequency scanners and sophisticated conveyor and put to light systems 
we operate with engineered labor standards and incentive programs in each of our distribution centers  which have contributed to improved labor productivity 
each store is currently serviced by one of our three main distribution centers  with the regional distribution centers handling bulk materials  such as oil 
all of our merchandise is shipped by vendors to our distribution centers  with the exception of batteries and some special order products  which are shipped directly to stores by the vendor 
we have sufficient warehouse and distribution capacity to meet the requirements of our expected growth plans for the foreseeable future 
seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the months of june through october overlapping our second and third fiscal quarters 
in addition  our business is affected by weather conditions 
while unusually severe or inclement weather tends to reduce sales  as our customers are more likely to defer elective maintenance during such periods  extremely hot and cold temperatures tend to enhance sales by causing auto parts to fail and sales of seasonal products to increase 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business  including those governing the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous substances  the recycling of batteries and used lubricants  and the ownership and operation of real property 
for example  under environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in soil or groundwater 
such laws often impose joint and several liability and liability may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release of such hazardous substances 
we have recorded no liabilities to provide for the cost of environmental remediation activities  as we do not believe that we have incurred any such liabilities 
at some of our locations acquired in prior years  automobiles are serviced in automotive service facilities that we sublease to third parties 
as a result of investigations undertaken in connection with such acquisitions  we are aware that soil or groundwater may be contaminated at some of these properties 
although there can be no assurance  based on current information and  in some cases  indemnities we obtained from the former operators of these facilities  we believe that any such contamination will not result in any liabilities that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as part of our operations  we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with  for example  our oil recycling program 
we currently provide a recycling program for batteries and for the collection of used lubricants at certain of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors 
the batteries and used lubricants are collected by our associates  deposited into vendor supplied containers pallets and then disposed of by the third party vendors 
in general  our agreements with such vendors contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination that may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to off site properties including as a result of waste disposal and to our properties  when caused by the vendor 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our operations to date  but there can be no assurance that future compliance with such laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

we expect the expansion to be complete in fiscal as of january   all but one of our operating stores was leased 
the expiration dates including renewal options of the store leases are summarized as follows number of years stores thereafter additional information regarding our facilities appears in item business  under the captions store operations  store formats  and warehouse and distribution 
item legal proceedings during the third quarter of fiscal  we received notification from the state of california board of equalization the board of an assessment for approximately million for sales tax and approximately million for related interest based on the board s audit findings for the tax periods of october through september during this time period  we refunded the sales tax associated with battery cores to customers who returned a battery core to our stores 
the board believes that the sales tax associated with the battery cores should have been remitted to the taxing authority rather than refunded to the customers 
based on the board s position  we could be responsible for the sales tax and related interest associated with this matter for the audited periods of october through september  plus the additional unaudited time period 
table of contents through december  when we changed our business practices in this area to mitigate potential future tax related liability 
we believe that we have a strong basis under california law for disputing the payment of this assessment  and in october we timely filed a petition for redetermination with the board 
in may  we received a response from the board indicating that the district office that conducted the audit upheld its position 
we attended an appeals conference on april  and are awaiting the decision from the appeals conference 
our practices through december relative to the handling of taxes on battery cores had been consistent for over a decade  and it is our position that our consistent treatment of battery core charges  together with prior tax audits and tax auditors written commentary concerning our handling of such charges  permits us to rely upon precedent set in prior audits 
reliance on prior audits is a position that is supportable under california law 
we also have other defenses and intend to vigorously defend our position with regard to this matter 
a liability for the potential sales tax and related interest payments has not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
we were served on october  with a lawsuit that was filed in the superior court in san diego  california 
the case was brought by a former sales associate in california who resigned in january  and purports to be a class action on behalf of all current and former california hourly store employees claiming that plaintiff and those similarly situated were not paid for i all time worked ie off the clock work  ii the minimum reporting time pay when they reported to work a second time in a day  iii all overtime due  iv all wages due at termination  and v amounts due for late or missed meal periods or rest breaks 
plaintiff also alleges that we violated certain record keeping requirements arising out of the foregoing alleged violations 
the lawsuit claims these alleged practices are unfair business practices  and requests back pay  restitution  penalties for violations of various labor code sections and for failure to pay all wages due on termination  and interest for the last four years  plus attorney fees and that the company be enjoined from committing further unfair business practices 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to all of these claims and intend to defend the claims vigorously 
if one or more of the claims is permitted by the court to proceed as a class action and is decided against us  the aggregate potential financial exposure could be material to our annual results of operations 
we do not believe an adverse outcome would materially affect our liquidity or consolidated financial position 
however  the litigation is in its early stages and we cannot predict the outcome with any certainty 
a liability for this matter has not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
we currently and from time to time are involved in other litigation incidental to the conduct of our business  including asbestos and similar product liability claims  slip and fall and other general liability claims  discrimination and employment claims  vendor disputes  and miscellaneous environmental and real estate claims 
the damages claimed in some of this litigation are substantial 
based on internal review  we accrue reserves using our best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities 
we do not currently believe that any of these other legal claims incidental to the conduct of our business  individually or in the aggregate  will result in liabilities material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

in march  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb reached consensus on certain matters discussed in eitf  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
eitf states that allowances provided by vendors are presumed to be a reduction in the costs of purchasing inventories to be recognized in inventory and cost of sales  except for that portion that is a reimbursement for costs incurred to sell the vendors products 
in order to qualify as a reimbursement  the costs must be specific  identifiable and incremental  to be recognized as a reduction to operating and administrative expenses 
under previous accounting guidance  we accounted for all non performance based vendor allowances as a reduction of inventory cost and allocated performance based vendor allowances as a reduction of advertising expense or cost of goods sold  as appropriate  in the period the expense was incurred 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the provisions of eitf and implemented a policy of considering all cooperative advertising arrangements and other vendor allowances to be a reduction of product costs  unless we are specifically required to substantiate costs incurred to the vendor and do so in the normal course of business 
for fiscal  and  vendor allowances totaling approximately million  million and million  respectively  were classified as a reduction to advertising expense in operating and administrative expense rather than as a reduction to cost of sales as currently required by eitf during fiscal and  we incurred transition and integration costs associated with certain store acquisitions of million and million  respectively 
these costs have been included in operating and administrative expenses 
amounts relate to costs incurred in connection with the closure of existing stores

during fiscal  we invested approximately million in this joint venture and in the same year we wrote off our investment 
represents sales to commercial accounts  including sales from stores without commercial sales centers 
comparable store net sales data is calculated based on the change in net sales commencing after the time a new store has been open twelve months 
therefore  sales for the first twelve months a new store is open are not included in the comparable store calculation 
relocations are included in comparable store net sales from the date of opening 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our fiscal year ends on the sunday nearest to january and is named for the calendar year just ended 
occasionally this results in a fiscal year that is weeks long 
when we refer to a particular fiscal year we mean the following fiscal means the weeks ended january   fiscal means the weeks ended february   and fiscal means the weeks ended february  csk auto corporation is the largest specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories in the western united states and one of the largest retailers of these products in the united states based  in each case  on our number of stores 
we compete in the us automotive aftermarket industry and sell replacement parts excluding tires  accessories  maintenance items  batteries and automotive fluids for cars and light trucks 
our customers include people who work on their own car  the do it yourself diy market  and commercial installers who work on other peoples cars  the do it for me difm market 
we believe that the us automotive aftermarket industry is characterized by stable demand and is growing because of increases in  among other things  the age of vehicles in use and the number of miles driven annually per vehicle 
as of january   we operated  stores under one fully integrated operating format and three brand names checker auto parts  founded in  with stores in the southwestern  rocky mountain and northern plains states and hawaii  schucks auto supply  founded in  with stores in the pacific northwest and alaska  and kragen auto parts  founded in  with stores primarily in california 
during fiscal  we opened stores  relocated stores and closed stores in addition to the stores closed due to relocation 
we expect to open or relocate approximately stores in fiscal accounting change and restatement of financial statements we implemented a voluntary change in our method of accounting for inventories  which is effected by a retroactive restatement of our historical financial statements 
in addition  we recently identified errors in our accounting for leases and vendor allowances  which required a restatement of our historical financial statements 
change in inventory accounting method we historically used the last in  first out lifo method for accounting for inventories 
we changed our method of determining the cost of inventories to the first in  first out fifo method effective the fourth quarter of fiscal we have applied this accounting change retroactively by restating prior period financial statements as required by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes 
our inventory levels over the last five years have increased modestly due to new store openings and growth 
during the same time  we were able to reduce the overall unit costs of our inventories 
in this environment  our lifo method of accounting was resulting in an increasing difference between the carrying cost of inventories on our balance sheet and our current product acquisition costs 
the carrying cost on our balance sheet under lifo reflected the higher prices paid for inventories in prior periods and also included higher costs paid for inventories purchased in connection with our prior business acquisitions 
since we do not expect the pricing environment for most products we purchase to change dramatically in the foreseeable future  this difference between lifo cost and replacement cost can be expected to continue and possibly increase as we continue to pursue strategies to reduce our product acquisition costs 
the fifo method of inventory accounting will result in reported inventory cost on our balance sheet that approximates replacement 
table of contents costs  which we believe is preferable to continuing to report our inventories at the higher costs we experienced in prior years 
although the primary effect of the change was a decrease in inventory on our balance sheet  it also has a significant impact on our determination of cost of sales because of differences in unit costs and increases in the amount of vendor allowances and inventory purchasing and handling costs that will remain in inventories at period end under fifo 
the change increased our cost of sales approximately million in fiscal lease accounting restatement at january   we operated in excess of  leased locations  primarily consisting of our retail stores  but also including warehouses  distribution centers and our corporate office facilities 
we recently identified accounting errors pertaining to the evaluation of lease terms thus impacting our amortization of leasehold improvements  free rent periods ie  rent holidays  straight lining of minimum escalating lease payments  the classification of landlord incentives allowances  and the treatment of costs incurred for certain stores which are constructed and subsequently transferred to our landlords 
we have corrected these errors by restating prior period financial statements 
we reevaluated our lease terms for our operating leases which resulted in a reduction to the useful life assumption for depreciating leasehold improvements 
we previously depreciated leasehold improvements over the term of the lease which consisted of the initial term and could include one renewal option period but no more than years in total 
we now include renewal option periods only if they are included in the lease term as defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as amended 
the impact of this increased our annual depreciation expense for the earlier years of the lease 
we previously recorded build out allowances we received from landlords as an offset to the amounts capitalized as leasehold improvements 
we are now recording such allowances as a deferred rent liability with a related increase in recorded property assets resulting in an increase to depreciation expense while the amortization of the deferred rent liability reduces operating rent expense over the lease term 
this change also increases our reported capital expenditures investing cash flows and our operating cash flows we report in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we identified a small number of stores where the extent of our monetary involvement in the construction of the store based on the excess of our construction costs over the landlord s reimbursement to us of such costs results in capitalization of the construction costs as an asset and recording the landlord reimbursement as construction debt under emerging issues task force no 
eitf  the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction 
we also identified situations where we did not straight line escalating rent or recognize rent for free rent periods 
the net effect of the required adjustments to address these errors increased rent expenses in our historical financial statements 
vendor allowance restatements we historically recognized estimated vendor allowances in a systematic manner ratably over a performance period that ran from october through september 
this recognition period was initially selected to match the benefits to be received with costs we were incurring to perform promotional activities required to earn the vendor allowances 
we recently reevaluated this accounting convention and concluded that the recognition period should be corrected to a calendar year because substantially all allowances are determined and collected based on purchases from vendors in the calendar year 
we also recently identified vendor allowances recorded in fiscal that will not be collected and have determined that the amounts were recorded because of errors in estimation in earlier periods 
in addition  we identified certain vendor allowances recorded in improper periods 
the majority of the adjustments were made to fiscal and  however  adjustments were also made to fiscal  and first three quarters of fiscal by year  we increased decreased our cost of sales by million for the nine months of fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in 
table of contents fiscal these errors were primarily the result of imprecise estimates  bookkeeping errors and recording allowances in the incorrect periods 
we have applied the changes required retroactively by restating prior period financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
overview our sales were basically flat compared to the prior year and our comparable store sales sales in stores open at least twelve months decreased by 
we believe our sales were negatively impacted by  among other things  higher gas prices and milder summer temperatures in many of our key markets 
our average transaction size dollars spent per sale  however  increased over the prior year and our inventory management process allowed us to effectively control our inventory with only a slight increase compared to the prior year 
in light of these conditions  we will continue to analyze our operating and administrative expenses to further reduce our cost structure  review and refine our core product categories  such as batteries  brakes  shocks  starters and alternators  to ensure that we are meeting our customers expectations  add new product offerings as we deem appropriate to give our customers additional reasons to shop our stores  and review our marketing programs  sales promotions  event marketing and sports sponsorships to build customer awareness and help drive store traffic 
our goal is to remain focused on our long term objectives and continue to manage our business toward achievement of those objectives 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold our wholly owned subsidiary  automotive information systems  inc ais to mobile productivity  inc mpi 
ais provides diagnostic vehicle repair information to automotive technicians  automotive replacement parts manufacturers  automotive test equipment manufacturers and do it yourself consumers 
the transaction did not have a material impact on our fiscal financial statements 
the discussion that follows includes several references to charges and effects relating to significant events that occurred during the periods covered on august   we amended our senior credit facility to provide for an immediate reduction of the interest rate on our term loan of basis points and an opportunity for an additional basis points reduction of the interest rate on such term loan upon the achievement of certain conditions  as more particularly set forth in the amendment 
the amendment also provided for a one year extension of the term loan maturity to august we refer to these transactions as our amendment 
in january fiscal  we redeemed approximately of our outstanding million senior notes  issued million of senior subordinated notes  and amended our credit facility  increasing the availability and reducing the interest rate 
we refer to these transactions as our refinancing 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted emerging issues task force eitf accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
this required us to account for certain vendor allowances as a reduction of inventory and cost of sales rather than as a reduction of advertising expense in operating and administrative expense as in prior fiscal years 
in july  we sold approximately million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at per share 
in addition  a selling stockholder sold approximately million shares in this offering and  together with other affiliated stockholders  this stockholder group sold their remaining approximately million shares on november  these transactions are referred to collectively as the offering 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year restated restated net sales cost of sales gross profit operating and administrative expenses store closing costs operating profit interest expense loss on debt retirement income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss net sales net sales and sales data for the prior three years were as follows sales in thousands net sales sales data retail sales commercial sales other sales total net sales sales growth retail sales sales growth commercial sales sales growth comparable retail stores sales growth comparable commercial stores number of stores open at end of year retail sales represent sales to the do it yourself customer 
commercial sales represent sales to commercial accounts  including such sales from stores without commercial sales centers 
we evaluate comparable or same store sales based on the change in net sales commencing after the time a new or acquired store has been open for twelve months 
therefore  sales for the first twelve months a new or acquired store is open are not included in the comparable store calculation 
stores that have been relocated are included in comparable store sales 
retail sales and commercial sales were flat in fiscal as compared to fiscal fiscal started strong as our first quarter total sales and comparable store sales increased and  respectively 
sales improved in our core products such as batteries  brakes  shocks  etc 
in our second quarter  sales began to decline with a and decrease in total and comparable store sales  respectively 
the decline was primarily within our heat related categories  which we believe were negatively impacted by higher gas prices and milder summer temperatures in many of our key markets 
total sales and comparable store sales continued to decline in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  which we attribute to the continuing increase in gas prices and general economic conditions 

table of contents retail sales and comparable store sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase in average sale per customer as a result of our new product offerings including performance products  garage maintenance items  the wheel category and specialty auto related items 
commercial sales decreased slightly  while comparable commercial sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in comparable commercial sales reflected sales increases in our on going commercial centers  while the overall reduction in commercial sales reflected our consolidation of certain commercial sales centers in an effort to improve overall profitability 
gross profit gross profit consists primarily of net sales less the cost of sales and warehouse and distribution expenses 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our product mix  price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal during fiscal  our gross profit improved relative to the prior year due to lower product acquisition costs and reduced inventory shrinkage 
these margin improvements were offset by lower vendor allowances in fiscal than in fiscal in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded charges of million relative to our decision to discontinue offerings of street scooters and overstocked promotional merchandise  which we expect to sell below cost in fiscal gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal adjusting fiscal for the effects of eitf would have increased fiscal gross profit by million and gross profit as a percent of net sales to  which  as a percent of net sales  is relatively consistent with fiscal during fiscal  we began selling several new product offerings  which resulted in higher average dollar transactions and higher gross profit dollars  but carried slightly lower gross profit rates 
sales of these new products allowed us to further leverage our fixed store level selling and operational costs 
the lower margins on new products were partially offset by our continued emphasis on lowering acquisition costs of inventory in our existing product categories 
operating and administrative expenses operating and administrative expenses are comprised of store payroll  store occupancy  advertising expenses  other store expenses and general and administrative expenses  including salaries and related benefits of corporate employees  administrative office occupancy expenses  data processing  professional expenses and other related expenses 
operating expenses increased by approximately million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal expenses in fiscal were higher due primarily to our increased store count  slightly higher advertising expenses and increased payroll and benefit related costs 
operating expenses increased by approximately million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal the following items impacted the comparability of operating expenses for the fiscal years indicated net advertising expense in fiscal included million of vendor allowances  which reduced operating expenses and  as a result of eitf  similar allowances were classified in cost of sales during fiscal during fiscal  we incurred a charge for workers compensation of approximately million reflecting increased loss reserves for claims incurred during plan years through and claims relating to the acquired paccar stores  in response to increasing medical and claims costs  primarily in california 
operating expenses as a percent of sales were favorably impacted by our ability to leverage our fixed operating costs over our increasing sales and our continued focus on expense controls 

table of contents store closing costs store closing costs include amounts for new store closures  revisions in estimates for stores currently in the closed store reserve  operating and other expenses and accretion expense  which is the change in closed store liability due to the passage of time 
store closing costs in fiscal were million higher and million higher than in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  primarily as a result of the impact in fiscal of a new closed store reserve established relative to our change in exit strategy 
in fiscal  we reversed the existing closed store reserve that was previously established under eitf and establish a new reserve under the guidance of sfas no 
which resulted in a charge to the reserve of million see store closures in liquidity and capital resources 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal the decrease primarily reflects an approximately million reduction in interest due to lower average interest rates achieved as part of our refinancing 
interest expense for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal this decrease primarily reflects an approximately million reduction in interest expense due to lower average outstanding debt levels throughout the year and an approximate million reduction in interest expense as a result of lower average interest rates due  in part  to our refinancing 
loss on debt retirement during fiscal  we redeemed the remaining approximately million of our senior notes due in conjunction with this transaction  we incurred a loss on debt retirement of million that included early redemption premiums  the write off of certain financing fees and other direct costs 
in conjunction with our refinancing  we incurred a loss on debt retirement of million due primarily to the redemption of of our senior notes  partially offset by a prorata adjustment representing the unamortized gain on a terminated interest rate swap 
during fiscal  we redeemed million of our senior subordinated notes with proceeds from the offering 
in conjunction with this transaction  we incurred a loss on debt retirement of million that included early redemption premiums  the write off of certain financing fees and other direct costs 
income tax expense income tax expense for fiscal was million or of income before income taxes  compared to a tax benefit of million or for fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was impacted by the non deductibility of certain expenses and lower credits year over year as a percent to pre tax income 
income tax benefit for fiscal was million or of income before income taxes  compared to a tax benefit of million or of income before income taxes for fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal is higher than the effective tax rate in fiscal primarily due to the amount of state income tax credits recognized in liquidity and capital resources recent events on december   we redeemed the approximately million remaining balance of our senior notes due at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the redemption was funded with existing cash on hand 
as a result  we anticipate a reduction in annual interest expense of approximately million 

table of contents on june   our board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorized the purchase of shares of our common stock with an aggregate purchase price not to exceed million 
the program provides that we may buy shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and that we will base our decisions on whether to repurchase shares and the timing of any such repurchases on factors including the stock price  our cash and debt levels  and general economic and market conditions 
shares of stock repurchased under the program will be retired and returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares 
this program will expire in december during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock 
since the inception of this program  we have repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately million 
on april   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert million of our senior subordinated notes due to a floating rate  set quarterly in arrears  equal to the month libor basis points 
the agreement is for the term of the notes 
the hedge is considered to qualify as a fair value hedge  accordingly  the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the underlying debt will be reported on our balance sheet 
based upon our assessment of effectiveness of the hedge  changes in the fair value of this derivative and the underlying debt are not expected to result in a material impact on net income 
the differential to be paid or received under this agreement was accrued consistent with the terms of the agreement and was recognized in interest expense over the term of the related debt 
cash flows related to the interest rate swap agreement are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
we reduced interest expense by million in fiscal as a result of this interest rate swap 
in our refinancing  we replaced our then existing million senior credit facility with a new million senior collateralized  asset based credit facility consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving credit commitment 
we used proceeds from our refinancing to redeem the remaining million in aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes 
overview of liquidity debt is an important part of our overall capitalization 
while we are still highly leveraged  our outstanding debt continues to decline 
our outstanding debt balance excluding capital leases at the end of fiscal was million  a decrease of million from our outstanding debt of million at the end of fiscal our primary cash requirements include working capital primarily inventory  interest and amortization payments on our debt and capital expenditures 
we intend to finance our cash requirements with cash flow from operations  borrowings under our senior credit facility and short term trade credit relating to extended payment terms for inventory purchases 
as of january  and february   there were no borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the following table outlines certain key financial measures that impact our liquidity in thousands february  february  january  restated restated cash availability under revolving credit facility working capital availability under our revolving line of credit decreased as of january  relative to the prior year  primarily due to the issuance of letters of credit relating to our increased purchases of import products 
analysis of cash flows operating activities during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million of cash provided by operating activities during fiscal the most significant components of the change are net income in fiscal of million compared to net loss of million in fiscal and a significant increase in deferred taxes in fiscal partially due to the utilization of a portion of our net 
table of contents operating loss carryforwards  a cash outflow of million in fiscal relating to premiums paid on early retirement of debt compared to million during fiscal relating to early redemption premiums associated with our refinancing  and a cash inflow during fiscal of million associated with the termination of our interest rate swap agreement 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million of cash provided by operating activities during fiscal the most significant components of the change are a cash outflow of million during fiscal related to early redemption premiums associated with our refinancing  a cash inflow during fiscal of million associated with the termination of our interest rate swap agreement  and a million decrease in cash used to support working capital requirements 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal  compared to million used in investing activities during fiscal capital expenditures increased to million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal primarily as a result of new store improvements  additional capital upgrades to existing stores  and the purchase of certain leased assets 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal  compared to million used in investing activities during fiscal capital expenditures increased to million during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase in capital expenditures related to the upgrade of certain information systems along with the purchase of certain leased assets 
in addition  during the fiscal period we received million in proceeds from certain fixed asset sales and million in cash proceeds from the sale of stores in texas 
we have budgeted approximately million for capital expenditures for fiscal  primarily for new stores and general corporate purposes 
we opened  relocated or expanded stores in fiscal and expect to open or relocate approximately stores in fiscal we anticipate that the majority of these stores will be financed under arrangements structured as operating leases that require minimal capital expenditures for fixtures and store equipment 
for the remainder of our planned new  relocated or expanded stores  we expect to spend approximately  per store for leasehold improvements 
in addition to capital expenditures  each new store  except for relocated stores  will require an estimated investment in working capital  principally for inventories  of approximately  financing activities net cash used in financing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million used in financing activities during fiscal the significant components of the change are during fiscal we utilized approximately million of our cash to repurchase and subsequently retire approximately million shares of our common stock  no such purchases were made in fiscal  during fiscal proceeds from the exercise of stock options were million higher than fiscal as a result of significant stock option exercises  we generated million of net financing proceeds in fiscal as a result of our refinancing compared to million paid during fiscal relating to the redemption of our remaining balance of our million senior notes  and payments for debt issuance costs were million less during fiscal than in fiscal as a result of our refinancing 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a result of our refinancing  we generated million of net financing proceeds 
in fiscal  we redeemed a portion of our senior subordinated notes with proceeds from the offering 
this resulted in net cash proceeds of million 
the most significant components of the change in financing activities year over year relate to net cash received from the refinancing  which provided million more in cash than the sale of stock and note redemption in fiscal  net payments on normal loan activity during fiscal  which were million higher than net loan payments in fiscal  payments on capital lease obligations in fiscal  which were million higher than in fiscal 
table of contents primarily resulting from the buy out of certain lease obligations  and stock option exercises in fiscal  which provided million of additional cash year over year 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we lease our office and warehouse facilities  all but one of our retail stores  and some of our equipment 
certain of the equipment leases are classified as capital leases and  accordingly  the equipment and related obligation are recorded on our balance sheet 
however  substantially all of our store leases are operating leases with private landlords and provide for monthly rental payments based on a contractual amount 
the majority of these lease agreements are for base lease periods ranging from to years  with three to five renewal options of five years each 
certain store leases also provide for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of sales in excess of a stipulated minimum 
we believe that the long duration of our store leases offers security for our store locations without the risks associated with real estate ownership 
our lease for our corporate headquarters was formerly with a landlord  which  until november  was a related party 
we currently have a lease for a parking lot adjacent to our headquarters facility with such landlord 
previously we had entered into sale leaseback or other financing arrangements with related parties 
we believe that the terms of the transactions with the related parties were no less favorable than terms we may have been able to receive from independent third parties at the time of the applicable transaction 
we also believe that these transactions as a whole are not material to our financial statements 
for more information on related party transactions  refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
we have seller financing arrangements related to debt established for stores in which we were the seller lessee and did not recover substantially all construction costs 
in those situations  we recorded our total cost in property plant and equipment and amounts funded by the lessor as a debt obligation on our balance sheet 
rental payments made to the lessor are charged in part to interest expense and reduce the corresponding debt based on amortization schedules 
in order to facilitate an understanding of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  the following data is provided in thousands payments due by period within after contractual obligation total year years years years long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations other total contractual obligations see recent events for discussion relating to our long term debt 
the estimate also assumes no outstanding balance on the revolver 
interest on the term loan was calculated assuming the current interest rate of would be in effect through the loan expiration date of august million of our million senior subordinated notes is subject to an interest rate swap agreement 
the estimate of the effect of the interest rate swap on interest was made assuming the current interest rate related to the rate swap would be in effect for the term of the rate swap 
capital lease payments include both principal and interest 
operating lease obligations are not reduced to reflect sublease income 
includes service contracts and building mortgages on leased property 

table of contents other commercial commitments consist of standby letters of credit totaling million  all of which expire in our inventory purchase commitments are cancelable and therefore not included in the above table 
store closures we provide an allowance for estimated costs to be incurred in connection with store closures 
on an on going basis  store locations are reviewed and analyzed based on several factors including market saturation  store profitability  and store size and format 
in addition  we analyze sales trends and geographical and competitive factors to determine the viability and future profitability of our store locations 
if a store location does not meet our required projections  it is considered for closure 
the allowance for store closing costs is included in accrued expenses and other long term liabilities in the accompanying financial statements and primarily consists of three components future rents to be paid over the remaining terms of the lease agreements for the stores net of estimated probable sublease recoveries  lease commissions associated with the anticipated store subleases  and occupancy expenses associated with the closed store vacancy periods 
prior to january   such costs were recognized when a store was specifically identified  costs could be estimated and closure was planned to be completed within the next twelve months in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
no provision was made for employee termination costs 
for stores to be relocated  such costs were recognized when an agreement for the new location had been reached with a landlord and site plans met preliminary municipal approvals 
during the period that they remained open for business  the rent and other operating expenses for the stores to be closed continued to be reflected in normal operating expenses 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
requires companies to recognize the fair value of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by sfas no 
include lease rental and termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  store closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
we have applied sfas no 
prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated or exit plans substantially modified after december  as required 
as a result of the refinancing transactions we completed in january  we increased our cash flow and financial flexibility  enabling us to pursue an alternate strategy to reduce our portfolio of closed stores  which includes lease buyouts and foregoing lease extensions on locations that we subleased at a marginal profit 
this change in strategy required us to establish a new closed store reserve based upon the guidance in sfas no 
and reverse the existing closed store reserve that was previously established under eitf sfas no 
requires that costs under a lease contract for a closed store be recognized at fair value and that the amount of remaining lease payments owed be reduced by estimated sublease income but not to an amount less than zero 
this change in methodology resulted in a non cash charge of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal the charge reflects the elimination from the reserve of net sublease income previously recorded for leases with incremental estimated sublease income in excess of the cost of the original lease  partially offset by the discounting of net cash outflow 
sublease income in excess of costs associated with the lease is recognized as it is earned 
as of january   we had a total of store locations included in the allowance for store closing costs 
of this total  locations were vacant and locations were subleased 
in addition to these stores  we had service centers also included in the allowance of which were vacant and were subleased 
future rent expense will be incurred through the expiration of the non cancelable leases  the longest of which runs through march 
table of contents activity in the allowance for store closing costs and the related payments for the three fiscal years ended january  is as follows in thousands fiscal year balance  beginning of year store closing costs adjustment of allowance to reflect change in exit strategy under fas provision for store closing costs adjustments to prior plans other revisions in estimates accretion operating expenses and other store closing costs payments rent expense  net of sublease recoveries occupancy and other expenses sublease commissions and buyouts total payments balance  end of year store closing costs in fiscal were composed of million associated with fiscal closures  million associated with revisions to estimates  million associated with accretion expense relating to the discounting of closed store liabilities  and million associated with other operating expenses such as utilities  repairs and maintenance costs that are expensed as incurred 
during fiscal  we recorded the following million in charges associated with the reversal of the reserve established under eitf and the establishment of a new closed store reserve on the basis of our change in exit strategy in accordance with the guidance in sfas no 
 million in charges under sfas no 
associated with the closure of stores  with the majority closed at the expiration of the master lease  and revisions in estimates of million primarily relating to charges initially recorded in fiscal ie  plan year resulting from changes in estimated vacancy periods and lower realized sublease rates 
during fiscal  we recorded the following gross store closing costs of million relating to the identification of stores for closure  an adjustment to prior plans of million primarily due to management s decision to utilize a warehouse and storage facility that was previously included within the plan year accrual in conjunction with purchase accounting adjustments as a result of certain acquisitions  and revisions in estimates of million million for plan year  million for plan year and million for plan years prior to relating to existing closed stores that have had longer than anticipated vacancy periods as a result of the continued economic slowdown 
we expect net cash outflows for closed store locations of approximately million during fiscal and the remainder of cash outflows to primarily occur during fiscal years through we plan to fund these outflows from normal operating cash flows 
we anticipate that we will close or relocate approximately stores during fiscal we anticipate that the majority of these closures will occur at the end of the lease terms  resulting in minimal closed store costs 
we anticipate total cash outflows relating to these stores of million  which includes estimated incremental costs to be measured at fair value when incurred 

table of contents factors affecting liquidity and capital resources sales trends our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the months of june through october overlapping our second and third fiscal quarters 
in addition  our business is affected by weather conditions 
while unusually severe or inclement weather tends to reduce sales  as our customers are more likely to defer elective maintenance during such periods  extremely hot and cold temperatures tend to enhance sales by causing auto parts to fail and sales of seasonal products to increase 
inflation we do not believe our operations have been materially affected by inflation 
we believe that we will be able to mitigate the effects of future merchandise cost increases principally through economies of scale resulting from increased volumes of purchases  selective forward buying and the use of alternative suppliers 
debt covenants our credit agreement contains negative covenants and restrictions on actions by us and our subsidiaries including  without limitation  restrictions and limitations on indebtedness  liens  guarantees  mergers  asset dispositions not in the ordinary course of business  investments  loans  advances  acquisitions  payment of dividends  transactions with affiliated parties  change in business conducted  certain prepayments other than in the ordinary course of business and amendments of subordinated indebtedness 
our credit agreement requires that we meet certain financial covenants  ratios and tests  including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
the consolidated leverage ratio is consolidated total funded debt  as defined in the credit agreement  divided by consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement 
the interest coverage ratio is consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  divided by cash interest expense  as defined in the credit agreement 
at january   our consolidated leverage ratio was to  and our interest coverage ratio was to  both of which were in compliance with the related covenants 
as discussed in item of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations above  we identified a small number of stores where the extent of our monetary investment in the construction of the stores requires capitalization of the improvements as assets and recording of the landlord reimbursement of costs as construction debt under eitf in light of this addition of incremental debt to our balance sheet required by eitf as well as the reduction in the required consolidated leverage ratio ie  debt to ebitda  as specifically defined in our credit agreement from to over the four fiscal quarters ended may   we entered into a waiver effective may   to our credit agreement waiver 
the waiver provides for the lenders waiver with respect to the first quarter of fiscal year ended may   of the company s compliance with the consolidated leverage ratio covenant  provided that the ratio for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended may   does not exceed to in addition  the waiver provides for the exclusion from indebtedness as defined in the credit agreement of all items that would be considered indebtedness under eitf for all purposes on and after may   not to exceed million in the aggregate 
with this waiver  we anticipate meeting all required covenants under our existing credit agreement in fiscal a breach of the covenants  ratios  or restrictions contained in our credit agreement could result in an event of default thereunder 
upon the occurrence of such an event of default  the lenders under our credit agreement could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness 
if the lenders under the credit agreement accelerate the payment of the indebtedness  we cannot be assured that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness 
although we have significantly reduced our outstanding debt over recent years  we are still highly leveraged 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences on our ability to obtain 
table of contents additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes 
a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes 
we are substantially more leveraged than some of our competitors  which might place us at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors that have lower debt service obligations and significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
we may not be able to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and we may be more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business 
credit ratings currently  our debt instruments are rated by the major debt rating agencies as shown below description of debt moody s rating standard poor s term loan ba b revolver ba b notes b b with respect to moody s  a rating of baa or above indicates an investment grade rating 
a rating below baa is considered to have speculative elements 
a ba ranking indicates an obligation that is judged to have speculative elements and is subject to substantial credit risk 
a b rating from moody s signifies an obligation that is considered speculative and is subject to high credit risk 
the  and modifiers show the relative standing within a major category 
a indicates that an obligation ranks in the higher end of the broad rating category  a indicating a mid range ranking  and a ranking at the lower end of the category 
with respect to standard poor s  a rating of bbb or above indicates an investment grade rating 
a rating below bbb indicates that the security has significant speculative characteristics 
a b rating indicates that standard and poor s believes the issuer has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation  but that adverse business  financial  or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment to the obligation 
standard and poor s may modify its ratings with a or a sign to show the obligor s relative standing within a major rating category 
interest rates financial market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
interest earned on our cash equivalents as well as interest paid on our variable rate debt and amounts received or paid on our interest rate swap are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
our variable rate debt relates to borrowings under our senior credit facility and the million amount of our rate swap  which are based on movements in the libor rate 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for a more detailed explanation about our variable interest rate risk 
critical accounting matters the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make critical accounting estimates that affect the amounts reported in those financial statements 
we define a critical accounting estimate as one that is both significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
periodically throughout the fiscal year  we evaluate our accounting estimates based on historical experience and other relevant factors and make adjustments as appropriate 
the following estimates involve a high degree of judgment and or complexity 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined utilizing the first in  first out fifo method 
effective the fourth quarter of fiscal  we changed our inventory accounting method from last in  first out lifo to fifo 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for an explanation of this change as well as the retroactive impact on historical financial statements 

table of contents at each balance sheet date  we adjust our inventory carrying balances by an estimated allowance for inventory shrinkage that has occurred since the taking of physical inventories and an allowance for inventory obsolescence  each of which is discussed in further detail below 
we reduce the fifo carrying value of our inventory for estimated loss due to shrinkage since the most recent physical inventory 
our store shrinkage estimates are determined by dividing the shrinkage loss based on the most recent physical inventory by the sales for that store since its previous physical inventory 
that percentage is multiplied by sales since the last physical inventory through period end 
our shrinkage expense for the fiscal years ended january   february  and february  was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
while the shrinkage accrual is based on recent experience  there is a risk that actual losses will be higher or lower than expected 
in most instances  we retain the right to return damaged  obsolete and excess merchandise inventory to our vendors 
in situations where we do not have a right to return generally for certain imported products  we may from time to time record an allowance representing an estimated loss for the difference between the cost of any damaged  obsolete or excess inventory and the estimated retail selling price 
inventory levels and margins earned on all products are monitored monthly 
quarterly  we make an assessment if we expect to sell any significant amount of inventory below cost and  if so  estimate the amount of allowance to record 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of approximately million for inventory obsolescence for merchandise which will be sold in future periods 
deferred tax asset included in our net deferred tax asset are deferred tax assets of million as of january   reflecting the benefit of federal and state tax loss carryforwards approximating million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in and  respectively 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards 
utilization of certain of the net operating loss carryforwards may be limited under section of the internal revenue code 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized with the exception of a portion of california enterprise zone credits for which management has determined that a valuation allowance in the amount of million is necessary 
legal matters we currently and from time to time are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business  including but not limited to asbestos and similar product liability claims  slip and fall and other general liability claims  discrimination and employment claims  vendor disputes  and miscellaneous environmental and real estate claims 
the damages claimed in some of this litigation are substantial 
based on an internal review  we accrue reserves using our best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities 
we do not currently believe that any of these legal claims  individually or in the aggregate  will result in liabilities material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  if our estimates related to these contingent liabilities are incorrect  the future results of operations for any particular fiscal quarter or year could be materially adversely affected 
self insurance reserves we purchase third party insurance for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability claims that exceed a certain dollar threshold 
however  we are responsible for the payment of claims under these insured limits 
in estimating the obligation associated with incurred losses  we utilize loss development factors prepared by independent third party actuaries 
these development factors utilize historical data to project the future development of incurred losses 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
although we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly 
table of contents from the historical trends and actuarial assumptions 
during fiscal we recorded million of workers compensation expense reflecting increased loss reserves for claims incurred during plan years through and claims relating to stores which we acquired from al s and grand auto supply  inc in  in response to increasing medical and claims costs  primarily in california 
our self insurance reserves approximated million and million at january  and february   respectively  and are included with current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
store closing costs if a store location does not meet our required standards  it is considered for closure 
we provide an allowance for estimated costs to be incurred in connection with store closures 
we establish this allowance based on an assessment of market conditions for rents and include assumptions for vacancy periods and sublease rentals 
in fiscal year  we were required to make adjustments of million to the allowance because actual market and other conditions were different from the assumptions we made at the time we established the allowance 
we may be required to make further adjustments in future periods 
there are several significant assumptions that underlie the estimates inherent in the closed store reserve 
these assumptions include real estate broker estimates for vacancy periods and estimated sublease rates based on the broker s experience and expertise  estimates for occupancy expenses based on historical averages and  in the case of real estate taxes  subject to changes by taxing authorities  and credit adjusted discount rates 
accordingly  we continuously review these assumptions and revise the reserve as necessary 
in addition  there are certain assumptions that are sensitive to deviations and could produce actual results significantly different from management s original assumptions 
these assumptions may be revised as follows national or regional economic conditions that can shorten or lengthen vacancy periods  deterioration of neighborhoods surrounding store locations resulting in longer than anticipated vacancy periods  changing subtenant needs resulting in functional obsolescence of store locations  and subtenant defaults or bankruptcies resulting in vacant properties 
historically  we have recorded revisions in estimates to the closed store reserve that have resulted from these issues 
these revisions usually result from overall longer vacancy periods on store locations and realized sublease rates lower than originally anticipated 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred 
a potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset s 
the estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations 
when a potential impairment has occurred  an impairment write down is recorded if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets 
actual results could differ  which could materially impact our impairment assessment 
goodwill impairment as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements  we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million 
in connection with the provisions of sfas no 
 we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill 
our test as of january   resulted in no impairment being identified 
however  the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans 
to the extent that our strategic plans change  or that economic and market conditions worsen  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
we hold no securities for purposes of trading 
interest earned on our cash equivalents as well as interest paid on our variable rate debt and the amounts received or paid on our rate swap are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in april  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert million of our senior subordinated notes due to a floating rate  set quarterly in arrears  equal to the month libor basis points 
the agreement is for the term of the notes 
the hedge is accounted for and recognized in results of operations as a fair value hedge  accordingly  the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the underlying debt are reported on our balance sheet 
based upon our assessment of effectiveness of the hedge  changes in the fair value of this derivative and the underlying debt are not expected to result in a material impact on net income 

table of contents our variable rate debt relates to borrowings under our senior credit facility and our rate swap which was described above  that are subject to changes in the libor rate 
our variable and fixed rate debt at january  consisted of the following in thousands average balance interest fixed or debt facility in us dollars rate variable senior credit facility term matures august  fair value  variable senior credit facility revolver matures june variable senior subordinated notes mature january  fair value  fixed fair market value of rate swap on million of senior subordinated notes sfas no 
hedge accounting adjustment seller financing arrangements eitf  various fixed total debt less capital leases the coupon rate of these notes is  however the effective interest rate is due to the reduction in interest expense resulting from the interest rate swap 
at january   of our outstanding debt was at variable interest rates and of our outstanding debt was at fixed interest rates 
with approximately million in variable rate debt outstanding  a change in the libor rate to which this variable rate debt is indexed would result in a million change in our annual interest expense 
this estimate assumes that our debt balance remains constant for an annual period and the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period
