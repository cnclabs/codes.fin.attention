overview the company provides air medical transportation services throughout the united states and designs  manufactures  and installs medical aircraft interiors and other aerospace and medical transport products 
the company s divisions  or business segments  are organized according to the type of service or product provided and consist of the following community based model cbm provides air medical transportation services to the general population as an independent service 
revenue consists of flight fees billed directly to patients  their insurers  or governmental agencies  and cash flow is dependent upon collection from these individuals or entities 
in the cbm division generated of the company s total revenue  increasing from in and in hospital based model hbm provides air medical transportation services to hospitals throughout the us under exclusive operating agreements 
revenue consists of fixed monthly fees approximately of total contract revenue and hourly flight fees approximately of total contract revenue billed to hospital customers 
in the hbm division generated of the company s total revenue  decreasing from in and in products division designs  manufactures  and installs aircraft medical interiors and other aerospace and medical transport products for domestic and international customers 
in the products division generated of the company s total revenue  decreasing from in and in see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for operating results by segment 
the company believes that the following factors have the greatest impact on its results of operations and financial condition flight volume 
fluctuations in flight volume have a greater impact on cbm operations than hbm operations because of cbm revenue is derived from flight fees  as compared to of hbm revenue 
by contrast  of the company s costs primarily associated with flight operations including salaries  aircraft ownership costs  hull insurance  and general and administrative expenses are mainly fixed in nature 
while flight volume is affected by many factors  including competition and the distribution of calls within a market  the greatest single variable has historically been weather conditions 
adverse weather conditions such as fog  high winds  or heavy precipitation hamper the company s ability to operate its aircraft safely and  therefore  result in reduced flight volume 
total patient transports for cbm operations were approximately  for compared to approximately  for patient transports for cbm bases open longer than one year same base transports were approximately  in compared to approximately  in receivable collections 
the company responds to calls for air medical transports without pre screening the creditworthiness of the patient 
for cbm operations  bad debt expense is estimated during the period the related services are performed based on historical collection experience 
the provision is adjusted as required based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
both the pace of collections and the ultimate collection rate are affected by the overall health of the us economy  which impacts the number of indigent patients and funding for state run programs  such as medicaid 
medicaid reimbursement rates in many jurisdictions have remained well below the cost of providing air medical transportation 
the company increased prices for its cbm operations approximately effective january and an additional effective september however  net revenue after bad debt expense per transport increased only from to generally  price increases result in incremental revenue from privately insured patients only 
bad debt expense as a percentage of related net flight revenue increased from in to in the company believes the decrease in collection rate is driven primarily by overall economic conditions 
in an effort to increase its collection rates  the company increased staffing in the billing and collections department  segmented billing by region  and hired a national billing director in aircraft maintenance 
both cbm and hbm operations are directly affected by fluctuations in aircraft maintenance costs 
proper operation of the aircraft by flight crews and standardized maintenance practices can help to contain maintenance costs 
increases in spare parts prices from original equipment manufacturers oem s tend to be higher for aircraft which are no longer in production 
three models of aircraft within the company s fleet  representing of the rotor wing fleet  are no longer in production and are  therefore  susceptible to price increases which outpace general inflationary trends 
in addition  on condition components are more likely to require replacement with age 
total maintenance expense for cbm and hbm operations  as adjusted for the change in accounting method described below  increased from to  while total flight volume for cbm and hbm operations increased over the same period 
the company continues to evaluate opportunities to modernize its fleet in order to enhance long term control over maintenance costs 
replacement models of aircraft  however  typically have higher ownership costs than the models targeted for replacement 
as described more fully below in liquidity and capital resources  in the company entered into two long term purchase commitments for a total of aircraft  designed to replace the discontinued models and other older aircraft over the next five to seven years 
cost pressures on healthcare institutions 
publicly and privately funded healthcare institutions both face pressures to reduce the rising cost of healthcare and to modify or eliminate certain non core operations as a result of reductions in funding 
flight programs based at a single hospital typically require subsidization from other hospital operations 
as a result  a growing number of healthcare institutions are evaluating their delivery model for air medical transportation services  creating expansion opportunities for cbm operations 
in the first quarter of  the cbm division commenced operations at two new bases in california which had previously been a hospital based flight program 
at the expiration of the contract in the first quarter of  one hbm customer also converted its flight program to the community based model with services provided by another operator 
the company expects the trend toward conversion of hbm programs to cbm operations to continue as healthcare institutions recognize the viable alternatives available for outsourcing 
competitive pressures from low cost providers 
the company is recognized within the industry for its standard of service and its use of cabin class aircraft 
many of the company s regional competitors utilize aircraft with lower ownership and operating costs and do not require a similar level of experience for aviation and medical personnel 
reimbursement rates established by medicare  medicaid  and most insurance providers are not contingent upon the type of aircraft used or the experience of personnel 
however  the company believes that higher quality standards help to differentiate its service from competitors and  therefore  lead to higher utilization 
deploying multiple aircraft in a market also serves as a barrier to entry for lower cost providers 
employee relations 
in september  the company s pilots voted to be represented by a collective bargaining unit 
negotiations on a collective bargaining agreement have continued since early  and a mediator was appointed in the fourth quarter of to assist with resolving differences between the parties 
other employee groups may also elect to be represented by unions in the future 
although the company believes that current salary and benefits arrangements are competitive with others within the industry  the impact of a collective bargaining agreement on the cost of operations has not yet been determined 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the company reported net income of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  net income for the year ended december   included the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  as discussed more fully below 
before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  the company reported net income of  for an increase in flight volume during the year was offset in part by increased aircraft maintenance costs and bad debt expense 
change in accounting method effective january   the company changed its method of accounting for major engine and airframe component overhaul costs from the accrual method of accounting to the direct expense method 
under the new accounting method  maintenance costs are recognized as expense as maintenance services are performed 
accordingly  effective january   the company reversed its major overhaul accrual totaling  for all owned and leased aircraft and reversed the remaining capitalized maintenance included in fixed assets relating to used aircraft purchases totaling  with the balance reflected as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of   net of income taxes of 
in  the impact of the major overhaul accrual relating to aircraft purchased in the rmh acquisition was considered a component of the valuation of the aircraft and did not affect the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill 
accordingly  the change in method to the direct expense method in resulted in a reduction in the asset value assigned to rmh aircraft 
the amount of the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle related to rmh aircraft was due exclusively to depreciation of the asset value or changes in the liability balances which had been expensed subsequent to the acquisition 
therefore  the majority of the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle related to aircraft which were in the company s fleet prior to the rmh acquisition 
pro forma results  assuming the change in accounting principle had been applied retroactively  are as follows for the year ended december  amounts in thousands as reported pro forma aircraft operations expense   depreciation and amortization   net income   basic income per share 

diluted income per share 

flight operations community based model and hospital based model flight revenue increased  or  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  flight revenue is generated by both hbm and cbm operations and is recorded net of contractual allowances under agreements with third party payers ie  medicare and medicaid 
cbm flight revenue increased  or  to  for the following reasons incremental revenue of  generated from the addition of new cbm bases during either or purchase of certain business assets from another air medical service provider in southeastern arizona in may  resulting in the expansion of operations from three bases to five 
transport volume for all bases in the region increased during the first four months of compared to the same period in  resulting in incremental revenue of approximately  closure of one base in the fourth quarter of  one in the first quarter of  and one during the third quarter of  resulting in a decrease in revenue of approximately  increase in same base transports 
excluding the impact of the new bases and base closures discussed above  total flight volume for all cbm operations increased in  primarily attributable to improved weather conditions and an increase in flight requests  driven in part by enhanced crew outreach and other marketing initiatives 
average price increase of approximately for all cbm operations effective january   and an average price increase of approximately effective september  decrease caused by a change in payer mix to a higher percentage of medicare medicaid transports  resulting in higher contractual discounts which are offset against flight revenue 
see discussion of total provision for uncollectible accounts  including contractual discounts and bad debt expense  below under bad debt expense 
hbm flight revenue increased  or  to  for the following reasons discontinuation of service under three contracts either prior to or during the first quarter of in addition  during the fourth quarter of  one hbm customer converted to cbm operations 
the resulting decrease in revenue from all of these actions was approximately  revenue of  generated by the addition of one new contract during the first quarter and the expansion of three contracts in the second and fourth quarters of annual price increases in the majority of contracts based on changes in the consumer price index 
increase of in flight volume for all contracts  excluding the discontinued contracts and new contracts discussed above 
flight center costs consisting primarily of pilot  mechanic  and medical staff salaries and benefits increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to changes by business segment are as follows cbm flight center costs increased  or  to  for the following reasons increase of  for the addition of personnel and facilities for the new base locations described above 
decrease of  due to the closure of base locations described above 
increases in salaries for merit pay raises 
increase of approximately  for telecommunications costs associated with dispatch operations 
hbm flight center costs increased  or  to  primarily due to the following decrease of  due to the closure of base locations described above 
increase of  for the addition of personnel and facilities for the new base locations described above 
increases in salaries for merit pay raises 
aircraft operating expenses increased  or  for the year ended december   in comparison to aircraft operating expenses consist of fuel  insurance  and maintenance costs and generally are a function of the size of the fleet  the type of aircraft flown  and the number of hours flown 
the increase in costs is due to the following addition of helicopters for cbm operations and for hbm operations during either or the resulting incremental impact for was an increase of approximately  increase of approximately in the number of engine events requiring significant repair or overhaul and increase of approximately in the number of blade repairs for bk helicopters compared to increase of approximately in the cost of aircraft fuel per hour flown 
decrease in hull insurance rates effective july aircraft rental expense increased  or  for the year ended december   in comparison to the year ended december  incremental rental expense incurred in for leased aircraft added to the company s fleet during either or totaled  bad debt expense increased  or  for the year ended december   compared to  due in part to the increase in related flight revenue 
in addition  bad debt expense as a percentage of related net flight revenue was in  compared to in flight revenue is recorded net of medicare medicaid discounts 
the total reserve for expected uncollectible amounts  including contractual discounts and bad debts  increased from of related gross flight revenue for to for the company believes the decrease in collection rates is due to general recessionary trends in the economy and a related increase in the number of uninsured patients and in patients covered by medicaid  as well as the dilutive effect of price increases on collection rates 
bad debt expense related to hbm operations and products division was not significant in either or medical interiors and products sales of medical interiors and products increased  or  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  significant projects in included production of multi mission medevac systems for the u 
s 
army s hh l black hawk helicopter  mev litter systems  a multi mission interior for a sikorsky firehawk helicopter for the los angeles county fire department  and four modular medical interiors for three commercial customers 
revenue by product line for the year ended december   was as follows  manufacture and installation of modular medical interiors  manufacture of multi mission interiors  design and manufacture of other aerospace and medical transport products significant projects in included the manufacture of eight modular medical interiors for four commercial customers and eleven hhl multi mission medevac systems 
revenue by product line for the year ended december   was as follows  manufacture and installation of modular medical interiors  manufacture of multi mission interiors  design and manufacture of other aerospace and medical transport products cost of medical interiors and products decreased  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the previous year 
the average net margin earned on projects during was compared to in  primarily due to the change in product mix 
the margin earned on multi mission interiors is typically higher than the margins earned on modular medical interiors for commercial customers 
in addition  aircraft interiors completed for commercial customers during were for new types of aircraft in which the company had not previously installed its modular interior  leading to higher engineering and documentation costs and lower profit margins 
cost of medical interiors and products also includes certain fixed costs  such as administrative salaries and facilities rent  which do not vary with volume of sales and which are absorbed by both projects for external customers and interdivisional projects 
general expenses depreciation and amortization expense decreased  or  for the year ended december   primarily due to the change in the method of accounting for major engine and airframe component overhauls and replacements  as discussed more fully above 
as part of the change in method  the company reversed the remaining capitalized maintenance included in fixed assets relating to used aircraft purchases  resulting in a decrease of approximately  in depreciation expense in the decrease was offset in part by depreciation on engine upgrades  medical interior and avionics upgrades  an upgraded flight tracking system  and computer hardware and software placed into service in general and administrative g a expenses increased  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   reflecting the growth in the company s operations 
g a expenses include accounting and finance  billing and collections  human resources  aviation management  pilot training  and cbm program administration 
g a expenses were of revenue for  compared to for during the last half of  the company formalized the organization structure for its cbm division along regional and program lines and added administrative personnel to manage the daily operations of cbm bases 
this increase in administrative staffing was offset in part by a reduction in flight center costs for personnel previously assigned exclusively to a single base of operation 
the company also increased the number of billing and collections personnel in to keep pace with the growth in cbm operations and to address a slowdown in collections in early during  the company also incurred approximately  in audit fees and outside consultant costs related to the audit of internal controls required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of these increases were offset in part by a decrease in aviation management costs resulting from the consolidation of faa part operating certificates from certificates at the beginning of to certificates by the beginning of interest expense decreased  or  for the year ended december   compared to  due to decreases in principal balances as a result of regularly scheduled payments and the refinancing of million of debt at lower interest rates during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of the company recorded income tax expense of  in and  in  both at an effective rate of approximately 
for income tax purposes  at december   the company has net operating loss carryforwards nol s of approximately million  expiring at various dates through during  nol s of million  for which a valuation allowance had previously been established  expired 
as of december   a valuation allowance has been provided for nol s which are not expected to be realized prior to expiration 
based on management s assessment  realization of net deferred tax assets through future taxable earnings is considered more likely than not  except to the extent valuation allowances are provided 
year ended december  compared to the company reported net income of  and income before income taxes of  for the year ended december   compared to  and  respectively  for the year ended december  results for included twelve months of rmh operations  while results included only two and a half months of rmh operations from the acquisition date of october   through the end of the year 
total revenue increased  or  in compared to  primarily due to the rmh acquisition and to the addition of ten new cbm bases during the year 
because the company has a high level of fixed costs  the slight decrease in net income from to was principally attributed to a decrease in flight volume caused by adverse weather conditions and a decline in collection rates on cbm operations  as discussed more thoroughly below 
flight operations community based model and hospital based model flight revenue increased  or  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  cbm flight revenue increased  or  to  total patient transports were approximately  for compared to approximately  for the increase in flight revenue was due to the following acquisition of rmh in october flight revenue for rmh cbm operations totaled  for compared to  from the acquisition date through december  revenue of  from the addition of ten new cbm bases throughout and one new base in the second quarter of price increase of approximately for all cbm operations effective november  decrease in flight volume for bases open longer than one year 
excluding the impact of the rmh acquisition and the addition of the new bases discussed above  total flight volume for cbm operations decreased in  compared to the prior year 
the decrease in flight volume is primarily attributed to adverse weather conditions in the first half of which prevented operation of the aircraft 
hbm flight revenue increased  or  to  for the following reasons acquisition of rmh 
flight revenue for rmh s hbm operations totaled  for compared to  from the acquisition date through december  incremental revenue of approximately  generated in by the addition of one new contract in the second quarter of and one in the third quarter of annual price increases in the majority of contracts based on changes in the consumer price index 
flight volume for all contracts  excluding rmh contracts and the new contracts discussed above  decreased for compared to the prior year 
flight center costs increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to changes by business segment are as follows cbm flight center costs increased  or  to  for the following reasons acquisition of rmh 
flight center costs related to rmh cbm operations totaled approximately  in compared to  from the acquisition date through december  approximately  for the addition of personnel and facilities for the new base locations described above

expenses for the rmh fleet totaled  for the year ended december   compared to  from the acquisition date through december  addition of eleven aircraft for cbm operations and three aircraft for hbm operations in late or in  resulting in an increase of approximately  for the year ended december  addition of personnel in aircraft overhaul  avionics repair  purchasing  and aircraft records departments to support the increase in the size of the fleet resulting from the rmh acquisition 
decrease of approximately in hull insurance rates effective july annual price increases in the cost of spare parts and overhauls 
aircraft rental expense increased  or  for the year ended december   in comparison to the year ended december  expense for rmh aircraft under operating leases totaled  for the year ended december   compared to  from the acquisition date through december  rental expense related to other leased aircraft added to the company s fleet totaled  for the year ended december  bad debt expense increased  or  for the year ended december   compared to  due primarily to the acquisition of rmh 
bad debt related to rmh cbm operations totaled  for the year ended december   compared to  from the date of acquisition through december  bad debt expense as a percentage of related net flight revenue increased from in to in flight revenue is recorded net of medicare medicaid discounts 
the total allowance for expected uncollectible amounts  including contractual discounts and bad debts  increased from of related gross flight revenue for the year ended december   to in the year ended december  the increase in total allowances is related primarily to the acquisition of rmh  whose collection experience had historically been less favorable than other cbm operations owned by the company  and to a decrease in the collection rate for other cbm operations 
the company believes the decrease in collection rates is also due to general recessionary trends in the economy 
bad debt expense related to hbm operations and products division was not significant in either or medical interiors and products sales of medical interiors and products increased  or  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  significant projects in included the manufacture of eight modular medical interiors for four commercial customers and eleven hhl multi mission medevac systems 
revenue by product line for the year ended december   was as follows  manufacture and installation of modular medical interiors  manufacture of multi mission interiors  design and manufacture of other aerospace and medical transport products significant projects in included the completion of five hh l multi mission medevac systems and development of the mev litter system  both for the us army  and the manufacture of medical interiors or modular interior components for six commercial customers 
revenue by product line for the year ended december   was as follows  manufacture and installation of modular medical interiors  manufacture of multi mission interiors  design and manufacture of other aerospace and medical transport products cost of medical interiors and products increased by for the year ended december   as compared to the previous year  reflecting the change in sales volume over the same period 
the cost of medical interiors and products also includes certain fixed costs  such as administrative salaries and facilities rent  which do not vary with volume of sales 
general expenses depreciation and amortization expense increased  or  for the year ended december  depreciation related to assets added as part of the rmh acquisition totaled  for the year ended december   compared to  from the date of the acquisition through december  the remainder of the increase for the year is related to the purchase of rotable and other equipment to support the expanded fleet and new bases of operation  as well as the refurbishment of medical interiors for existing aircraft 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   reflecting the impact of the rmh transaction 
on average  the company doubled the number of personnel in each area to manage the expanded operations with the acquisition of rmh and the growth outlined above in the discussion of flight revenue 
also included in general and administrative expenses are program administration costs for cbm operations 
program administration costs for rmh s cbm operations totaled  for the year ended december  interest expense increased  or  for the year ended december   compared to  primarily as a result of the rmh acquisition 
interest expense related to debt assumed or incurred in conjunction with the rmh acquisition totaled  for the year ended december   compared to  from the acquisition date through december  the company recorded income tax expense of  in and  in  both at an effective rate of 
liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of  as of december   compared to  at december  the change in working capital position is primarily attributable to the following increase of  in net receivables consistent with the increased revenue for the cbm division resulting from new base expansions and increases in flight volume 
decrease of  in short term accrued overhaul and parts replacement costs liabilities  due to the change in the method of accounting for major engine and airframe component overhaul costs from the accrual method of accounting to the direct expense method 
effective january   the company reversed its major overhaul accrual for all owned and leased aircraft 
increase of  in deferred income tax liabilities  primarily due to the change in the method of accounting for major engine and airframe component overhaul costs from the accrual method of accounting to the direct expense method 
previously  the accrual method of accounting for engine and airframe component overhaul costs resulted in a deferred tax asset  which had both a current and long term component 
cash requirements debt and other long term obligations the following table outlines the company s contractual obligations as of december  amounts in thousands less than after total year years years years long term debt      less interest payments     principal payments      capital leases less interest net present value operating leases      aircraft purchase commitments      total      interest payments include an estimate of variable rate interest on the company s senior revolving credit facility and two notes with principal balances totaling  as of december  variable interest was estimated using the weighted average rate in effect as of december   for each note and the weighted average balance outstanding against the revolving credit facility during repayment of debt and capital lease obligations as well as operating lease agreements constitute the company s primary long term commitments to use cash 
balloon payments on long term debt are due as follows  in  in  in  in  in off balance sheet arrangements residual value guarantees the company has entered into various aircraft operating leases under which it provides residual value guarantees to the lessor 
as of december   the undiscounted maximum amount of potential future payments under the guarantees is  no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses with respect to the guarantees  since it is not probable that the residual value of the aircraft will be less than the amounts stipulated in the guarantee 
the assessment of whether it is probable that the company will be required to make payments under the terms of the guarantee is based on current market data and the company s actual and expected loss experience 
aircraft purchase commitments prior to acquisition by the company  rmh entered into a commitment agreement to take delivery of eight aircraft for approximately  as of december   the company had taken delivery of all aircraft under the agreement 
prior to the acquisition  rmh entered into a commitment agreement to take delivery of ten aircraft for approximately  as of december   four aircraft with a total value of approximately  remained to be delivered and the deposit and related note payable associated with this commitment totaled  in march  the company entered into a commitment agreement to purchase eurocopter ec helicopters for approximately  with deliveries scheduled through the first quarter of as of december   the company had taken delivery of seven helicopters under the agreement 
in july  the company entered into a commitment agreement to purchase bell helicopters for approximately  beginning in  with a minimum of three deliveries per year 
the agreement provides for special incentives  including a trade in option for up to fifteen bell helicopters  with minimum guaranteed trade in values 
the company intends to place the new ec s and bell s primarily into existing bases and to either sell the aircraft which are replaced or redeploy them into the backup fleet 
typically the company has financed aircraft acquired under these or similar commitments through operating lease agreements 
letter of credit in august  the company entered into a  letter of credit with a financial institution to securitize an aircraft leased by the company under an operating lease agreement 
because the aircraft is operated in puerto rico  the lessor is unable to perfect its security interest against the aircraft 
the letter of credit perpetually renews for consecutive one year terms through the end of the lease agreement in july or until the aircraft is moved from puerto rico and reduces the available borrowing capacity under the company s senior revolving credit facility described below 
sources and uses of cash the company had cash and cash equivalents of  at december   compared to  at december  cash generated by operations increased to  in from  in receivable balances  net of bad debt expense  increased  in compared to  in despite the continued growth in operations 
the smaller increase reflects the decline in the overall collection rate for receivables in compared to and the results of the company s efforts to improve the pace of collections 
total cash collected against cbm receivable balances was million in  compared to million in cash used for investing activities totaled  in  compared to  in equipment acquisitions in consisted primarily of medical interior and avionics installations  information systems hardware and software  and rotable equipment

equipment acquisitions in consisted primarily of medical interior and avionics installations  upgrades for existing equipment  and rotable equipment 
financing activities used  in  compared to generating  in the company used proceeds from new note agreements originated in and to refinance existing debt with higher interest rates and to fund the acquisition of new software systems and other capital expenditures 
primary uses of cash in both and consisted of payments for long term debt and capital lease obligations 
in  the company issued million shares of common stock at per share in a private placement transaction 
net proceeds  after syndication and other costs  were  and were used primarily to fund current operations 
senior revolving credit facility in october  the company entered into a million senior revolving credit facility with certain lenders to finance a portion of the purchase price and related closing costs for the rmh acquisition and to provide working capital and letter of credit availability for future activities of the company 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of the company s non aircraft assets  including accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and general intangibles 
the facility matures october  but can be prepaid at any time  subject to payment of an early termination fee ranging from 
to if the termination occurs prior to october  indebtedness under the credit facility bears interest  at the company s option  at either i the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate as announced by the lenders plus an applicable margin ranging from to or ii a rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin ranging from to 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding balance against the line was 
the amount of borrowings permitted under the credit facility is based on a borrowing base comprised of i of accounts receivable from medicare  medicaid  insurance companies and community based payers and of other accounts receivable  and ii the lesser of a of inventory valued at the lower of cost or market  b of inventory valued at liquidation value  or c million 
at december    was available under the credit facility  and  was drawn against the line 
payment obligations under the credit facility accelerate upon the occurrence of defined events of default  including the following failure to pay principal or interest or to perform covenants under the credit facility or other indebtedness  events of insolvency or bankruptcy  failure to timely discharge judgments of  or more  failure to maintain the first priority status of liens under the credit facility  levy against a material portion of the company s assets  default under other indebtedness  suspension of material governmental permits  interruption of operations at any company facility that has a material adverse effect  and a change of control in the company

under an amendment to the agreement  the company accrued an amendment fee of  in in exchange for the elimination of a financial covenant for the duration of the agreement 
the fee is expected to be paid in the first quarter of other notes in january the company originated a note payable of  with interest at to refinance existing debt with a higher interest rate and to fund the acquisition of computer equipment and other capital expenditures  the note is payable through january in march the company originated a note payable of  with interest at to refinance existing debt with a higher interest rate  the note is payable through april in december the company originated a note payable of  with interest at to refinance the balloon payment due under a capital lease obligation 
the note is payable through december new community based operations opening a new community based operation typically requires an investment in an additional aircraft  aviation and medical personnel  and crew quarters 
the company may take possession of the additional aircraft up to three months prior to the commencement of operations in order to retrofit the aircraft for medical transport 
staff may also be hired a month in advance of the operation start date 
because of the delay between date of transport and collection of receivables from the patients or their insurers  new community based operations may not produce positive cash flow during at least the first three months of operation 
other sources as of december   the company held unencumbered aircraft with a net book value of million and has additional equity in other encumbered aircraft which could be utilized as collateral for borrowing funds as an additional source of working capital if necessary 
the company also has  unused capacity on its senior revolving credit facility 
the company believes that these borrowing resources  coupled with favorable results of operations  will allow the company to meet its obligations in the coming year 
outlook for the statements contained in this outlook are based on current expectations

cbm flight volume at all other locations during is expected to be consistent with historical levels  subject to seasonal  weather related fluctuations 
the company continues to evaluate opportunities to expand the cbm model in other communities 
hospital based model in the fourth quarter of  the company expanded two existing contracts in colorado and north carolina to additional satellite bases 
the company expects similar expansions to satellite locations under four other existing contracts during the second quarter of twelve hospital contracts are due for renewal in one was renewed for a year term during the first quarter of  and renewals on the remaining eleven contracts are still pending 
the company expects flight activity for continuing hospital contracts to remain consistent with historical levels 
products division as of december   the company was continuing the production of hh l units and mev units for the us army  a multi mission interior for the los angeles county fire department  and two modular medical interiors for a commercial customer 
remaining revenue for all contracts in process as of december   is estimated at million 
the current us army aviation modernization plan defines a requirement for hh l multi mission medevac units in total over an unspecified number of years 
the company has already completed hh l units under the program  in addition to the currently under contract 
the us army has also forecasted a requirement for a total of mev units over years  the company has previously delivered units  in addition to the units currently under contract 
there is no assurance that orders for additional units will be received in future periods 
all segments in the last six months of the company implemented new finance and accounting and new dispatch software and expects to implement new software for several other major information technology systems in the majority of the cost of new systems is expected to be financed through capital and operating lease agreements 
during the first quarter of  the company reached an agreement to amend to its senior revolving credit facility 
the amendment extends the maturity of the revolving credit facility to april and includes a million term loan  the proceeds of which will be used to retire the company s subordinated debt 
the terms and conditions of the senior revolving credit facility remain relatively unchanged under the amendment 
the term loan will be payable through april and will bear interest  at the company s option  at either i the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate as announced by the lenders plus an applicable margin ranging from to or ii a rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin ranging from to 
payments will consist of interest only during the first year with the principal payable as follows million in each of years and  million in each of years and  and million at maturity 
the company expects to write off approximately million in debt origination costs and note discount related to the subordinated debt and to pay a prepayment penalty of approximately million 
while there are certain conditions that must be met in order to finalize the amendment  the company expects to meet those conditions either late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of closing costs associated with the amendment are estimated to be  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to maintain flight volume or current collection rates on receivables for cbm operations  renew operating agreements for its hbm operations  or generate new profitable contracts for the products division 
risk factors actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those described in forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including but not limited to  those discussed above in outlook for and those described below 
flight volume all cbm revenue and approximately of hbm revenue is dependent upon flight volume 
approximately of the company s total operating expenses also vary with number of hours flown 
poor visibility  high winds  and heavy precipitation can affect the safe operation of aircraft and therefore result in a reduced number of flight hours due to the inability to fly during these conditions 
prolonged periods of adverse weather conditions could have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
typically  the months from november through february tend to have lower flight volume due to weather conditions and other factors  resulting in lower cbm operating revenue during these months 
flight volume for cbm operations can also be affected by the distribution of calls among competitors by local government agencies and the entrance of new competitors into a market 
collection rates the company responds to calls for air medical transport without pre screening the creditworthiness of the patient 
the cbm division invoices patients and their insurers directly for services rendered and recognizes revenue net of estimated contractual allowances 
the level of bad debt expense is driven by collection rates on these accounts 
changes in estimated contractual allowances and bad debts are recognized based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
collectibility is affected by the number of uninsured or indigent patients transported and is  therefore  primarily dependent upon the health of the us economy 
a significant or sustained downturn in the us economy could have an adverse impact on the company s bad debt expense 
highly leveraged balance sheet the company is obligated under debt facilities providing for up to approximately million of indebtedness  of which approximately million was outstanding at december  if the company fails to meet its payment obligations or otherwise defaults under the agreements governing indebtedness  the lenders under those agreements will have the right to accelerate the indebtedness and exercise other rights and remedies against the company 
these rights and remedies include the rights to repossess and foreclose upon the assets that serve as collateral  initiate judicial foreclosure against the company  petition a court to appoint a receiver for the company  and initiate involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the company 
if lenders exercise their rights and remedies  the company s assets may not be sufficient to repay outstanding indebtedness  and there may be no assets remaining after payment of indebtedness to provide a return on common stock 
restrictive debt covenants the subordinated notes and senior credit facility  into which the company entered to finance the acquisition of rmh  both contain restrictive financial and operating covenants  including restrictions on the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  to exceed certain annual capital expenditure limits  and to engage in various corporate transactions such as mergers  acquisitions  asset sales and the payment of cash dividends 
these covenants will restrict future growth through the limitation on capital expenditures and acquisitions  and may adversely impact the company s ability to implement its business plan 
failure to comply with the covenants defined in the agreements or to maintain the required financial ratios could result in an event of default and accelerate payment of the principal balances due under the subordinated notes and the senior credit facility 
given factors beyond the company s control  such as interruptions in operations from unusual weather patterns not included in current projections  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to remain in compliance with financial covenants in the future  or that  in the event of non compliance  the company will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders  or that to obtain such waivers  the company will not be required to pay lenders significant cash or equity compensation 
employee unionization in september  the company s pilots voted to be represented by a collective bargaining unit  the office and professional employees international union 
negotiations on a collective bargaining agreement have continued since early  and a mediator was appointed in the fourth quarter of to assist with resolving differences between the parties 
other employee groups may also elect to be represented by unions in the future 
although the company believes that current salary and benefits arrangements are competitive with others within the industry  the impact of a collective bargaining agreement on the cost of operations has not yet been determined 
governmental regulation the air medical transportation services and products industry is subject to extensive regulation by governmental agencies  including the federal aviation administration  which impose significant compliance costs on the company 
in addition  reimbursement rates for air ambulance services established by governmental programs such as medicare directly affect cbm revenue and indirectly affect hbm revenue from customers 
changes in laws or regulations or reimbursement rates could have a material adverse impact on the company s cost of operations or revenue from flight operations 
in january the company experienced two fatal accidents which are under investigation by the national transportation safety board 
the outcome of these investigations and the potential impact on the company s operations cannot yet be ascertained 
compliance with corporate governance and public disclosure regulations new laws  regulations  and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations  and nasdaq national market rules are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to lack of specificity 
their application may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
the company s efforts to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure in compliance with evolving laws and regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which requires the company to include management and auditor reports on internal controls as part of its annual report  has required commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
in addition  board members  the chief executive officer  and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  the company may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers 
if efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations  and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  the company s reputation may be harmed 
internal controls the company is required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of to include management and auditor reports on internal controls as part of its annual report 
management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective at december   and the company s independent auditors attested to that conclusion 
there can be no assurance that material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting will not be discovered in the future or that the company and its independent auditors will be able to conclude that internal control over financial reporting is effective in the future 
although it is unclear what impact failure to comply fully with section or the discovery of a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting would have on the company  it may subject the company to regulatory scrutiny and result in additional expenditures to meet the requirements  a reduced ability to obtain financing  or a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy of the company s financial reports 
competition hbm operations face significant competition from several national and regional air medical transportation providers for contracts with hospitals and other healthcare institutions 
in addition to the national and regional providers  cbm operations also face competition from smaller regional carriers and alternative air ambulance providers such as sheriff departments 
operators generally compete on the basis of price  safety record  accident prevention and training  and the medical capability of the aircraft 
the company s competition in the aircraft interior design and manufacturing industry comes primarily from three companies based in the united states and three in europe 
competition is based mainly on product availability  price  and product features  such as configuration and weight 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully for new or renewing contracts in the future 
fuel costs fuel accounted for of total operating expenses for the year ended december  both the cost and availability of fuel are influenced by many economic and political factors and events occurring in oil producing countries throughout the world  and fuel costs fluctuate widely 
recently the price per barrel of oil has been at an all time high 
the company cannot predict the future cost and availability of fuel 
the unavailability of adequate fuel supplies could have an adverse effect on the company s cost of operations and profitability 
generally  the company s hbm customers pay for all fuel consumed in medical flights 
however  the company s ability to pass on increased fuel costs for cbm operations may be limited by economic and competitive conditions and by reimbursement rates established by medicare  medicaid  and insurance providers 
aviation industry hazards and insurance limitations hazards are inherent in the aviation industry and may result in loss of life and property  thereby exposing the company to potentially substantial liability claims arising out of the operation of aircraft 
the company may also be sued in connection with medical malpractice claims arising from events occurring during a medical flight 
under hbm operating agreements  hospital customers have agreed to indemnify the company against liability arising out of medical malpractice claims and to maintain insurance covering such liability  but there can be no assurance that a hospital will not challenge the indemnification rights or will have sufficient assets or insurance coverage for full indemnity 
in cbm operations  company personnel perform medical procedures on transported patients  which may expose the company to significant direct legal exposure to medical malpractice claims 
the company maintains general liability aviation insurance  aviation product liability coverage  and medical malpractice insurance  and believes that the level of coverage is customary in the industry and adequate to protect against claims 
however  there can be no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that present levels of coverage will be available in the future at reasonable cost 
a limited number of hull and liability insurance underwriters provide coverage for air medical operators 
a significant downturn in insurance market conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company s cost of operations 
approximately of any increases in hull and liability insurance may be passed through to the company s hbm customers according to contract terms 
in addition  the loss of any aircraft as a result of accidents could cause both significant adverse publicity and interruption of air medical services to client hospitals  which could adversely affect the company s operating results and relationship with such hospitals 
foreign ownership federal law requires that united states air carriers be citizens of the united states 
for a corporation to qualify as a united states citizen  the president and at least two thirds of the directors and other managing officers of the corporation must be united states citizens and at least of the voting interest of the corporation must be owned or controlled by united states citizens 
if the company is unable to satisfy these requirements  operating authority from the department of transportation may be revoked 
furthermore  under certain loan agreements  an event of default occurs if less than of the voting interest is owned or controlled by united states citizens 
as of december   the company was aware of one foreign person who  according to recent public securities filings  is believed to hold approximately of outstanding common stock 
because the company is unable to control the transfer of its stock  it is unable to assure that it can remain in compliance with these requirements in the future 
acquisitions and integration the company has grown significantly through acquisitions in the past and will continue to pursue acquisitions in the future 
with any large acquisition  a significant effort is required to assimilate the operations  financial and accounting practices  and mis systems  and to integrate key personnel from the acquired business 
acquisitions may cause disruptions in company operations and divert management s attention from day to day operations 
the company may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions  profitability may suffer due to acquisition related costs or unanticipated liabilities  and the company s stock price may decrease if the financial markets consider the acquisitions to be inappropriately priced 
dependence on third party suppliers the company currently obtains a substantial portion of its helicopter spare parts and components from bell and aec  because its fleet is composed primarily of bell and eurocopter aircraft  and maintains supply arrangements with other parties for its engine and related dynamic components 
based upon the manufacturing capabilities and industry contacts of bell  aec  and other suppliers  the company believes it will not be subject to material interruptions or delays in obtaining aircraft parts and components but does not have an alternative source of supply for bell  aec  and certain other aircraft parts 
failure or significant delay by these vendors in providing necessary parts could  in the absence of alternative sources of supply  have a material adverse effect on the company 
because of its dependence upon bell and aec for helicopter parts  the company may also be subject to adverse impacts from unusually high price increases which are greater than overall inflationary trends 
increases in the company s monthly and hourly flight fees billed to its hbm customers may be limited to changes in the consumer price index 
as a result  an unusually high increase in the price of parts may not be fully passed on to the company s hbm customers 
employee recruitment and retention an important aspect of the company s operations is the ability to hire and retain employees who have advanced aviation  nursing  and other technical skills 
in addition  hospital contracts typically contain minimum certification requirements for pilots and mechanics 
employees who meet these standards are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in the foreseeable future 
if the company is unable to recruit and retain a sufficient number of these employees  the ability to maintain and grow the business could be negatively impacted 
department of defense funding several of the projects which have historically been significant sources of revenue for the products division  including hh l and mev systems  are dependent upon department of defense funding 
failure of the us congress to approve funding for the production of additional hh l or mev units could have a material adverse impact on products division revenue 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  uncollectible receivables  deferred income taxes  aircraft overhaul costs  and depreciation and residual values 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition fixed flight fee revenue under the company s operating agreements with hospitals is recognized monthly over the terms of the agreements 
flight revenue relating to patient transports is recognized upon completion of the services 
revenue and accounts receivable are recorded net of estimated contractual allowances under agreements with third party payers ie  medicare and medicaid 
estimates of contractual allowances are initially determined based on historical discount percentages for medicare and medicaid patients and adjusted periodically based on actual discounts 
if actual discounts realized are more or less than those projected by management  adjustments to contractual allowances may be required 
based on related flight revenue for the year ended december   a change of in the percentage of estimated contractual discounts would have resulted in a change of approximately  in flight revenue 
revenue related to fixed fee medical interior and products contracts is recorded as costs are incurred using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the company estimates the percentage of completion based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of an estimate of the total costs to complete the project 
losses on contracts in process are recognized when determined 
if total costs to complete a project are greater or less than estimated  the gross margin on the project may be greater or less than originally recorded under the percentage of completion method 
uncollectible receivables the company responds to calls for air medical transports without pre screening the credit worthiness of the patient 
uncollectible trade receivables are charged to operations using the allowance method 
estimates of uncollectible receivables are determined monthly based on historical collection rates and adjusted monthly thereafter based on actual collections 
if actual future collections are more or less than those projected by management  adjustments to allowances for uncollectible accounts may be required 
there can be no guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same collection rates that it has in the past 
based on related net flight revenue for the year ended december   a change of in the percentage of estimated uncollectible accounts would have resulted in a change of approximately  in bad debt expense 
deferred income taxes in preparation of the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciable assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income and records a valuation allowance for those amounts it believes are not likely to be realized 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance in a period increases income tax expense 
the company considers estimated future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
aircraft overhaul costs the company operates under an faa approved continuous inspection and maintenance program 
the company accounts for maintenance activities on the direct expense method 
under this method  commencing january   all maintenance costs are recognized as expense as costs are incurred 
prior to january   the company accrued for major engine and airframe component overhaul costs based on usage of the aircraft component over the period between overhauls or replacements in advance of performing the maintenance services 
depreciation and residual values in accounting for long lived assets  the company makes estimates about the expected useful lives  projected residual values and the potential for impairment 
estimates of useful lives and residual values of aircraft are based upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
changing market prices of new and used aircraft  government regulations and changes in the company s maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r statement r  accounting for stock based compensation  an amendment of fasb statement no 
statement r requires recognition of the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees in the income statement and is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  statement r provides for either a modified prospective or modified retrospective transition method for adopting the statement 
the company has not yet determined which transition method it will apply nor the impact of adopting statement r on its financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
statement  exchange of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
statement eliminates certain exceptions provided for by apb opinion no 
and instead requires that an exchange of nonmonetary assets be accounted for at fair value  including recognition of gain or loss  if the exchange has commercial substance and the fair value is determinable within reasonable limits 
the statement sets forth the criteria to be considered in determining whether the exchange has commercial substance 
statement is effective for exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company does not expect the adoption of statement to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
all of the company s product sales and related receivables are payable in us dollars 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its debt obligations and notes receivable  most of which have fixed interest rates  except  outstanding against the line of credit and  in notes payable 
based on the amounts outstanding at december   the annual impact of a change in interest rates would be approximately  interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates as of december  periodically the company enters into interest rate risk hedges to minimize exposure to the effect of an increase in interest rates 
as of december   the company was party to one interest rate swap agreement 
the swap agreement provides that the company will pay a fixed interest rate on  of notional principal and receive a floating interest rate libor plus on the same amount of notional principal from the counterparty
