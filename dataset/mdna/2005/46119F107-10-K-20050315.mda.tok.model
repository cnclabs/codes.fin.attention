overview introgen therapeutics  inc was incorporated in delaware in we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer and other diseases 
we are developing product candidates to treat a wide range of cancers using non integrating gene agents 
these agents are designed to increase production of normal cancer fighting proteins that act to overpower cancerous cells 
see the business overview section of this document beginning on page for a more complete discussion of our business 
since our inception in  we have used our resources primarily to conduct research and development activities for advexin therapy and  to a lesser extent  for other product candidates 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we anticipate we will incur losses in the future that may be greater than losses incurred in prior periods 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
during the year ended december   we used million of cash and cash equivalents for operating activities 
in addition  we used million for purchases of property and equipment and  for principal payments on notes payable to support those activities 
we expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses and losses over the next several years as our research  development  pre clinical testing and clinical trial activities continue and as we evolve our operations and systems to support commercialization of our product candidates 
these losses  among other things  have caused and may cause our total assets  stockholders equity and working capital to decrease 
currently  we earn revenue or income from federal research grants  contract services and process development activities  the lease of a portion of our facilities to m

anderson cancer center and interest income on cash placed in short term  investment grade securities 
in order to fund our operating losses  we will need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we do not know whether such additional financing will be available when needed  or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
in june  we sold million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million to selected institutional investors through a private placement pursuant to regulation d promulgated under the securities act of  as amended 
our net proceeds from this transaction  after related fees and expenses  were million 
in connection with this sale  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
these warrants are exercisable at any time by the warrant holders through june beginning in june  we may force the exercise of these warrants if the average closing market price of our common stock during any consecutive trading days is greater than per share 
the resale of the shares of common stock issued and issuable upon the exercise of the warrants issued in this transaction was registered on a registration statement on form s  effective august  commission file no 


table of contents in december  we sold approximately million shares of our common stock in a direct equity offering pursuant to a shelf registration for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million

registering the issuance of shares of our common stock with an aggregate offering price of million 
we may sell additional shares of our common stock pursuant to this registration statement in the future 
in may  we amended the mortgage note payable related to our facilities 
the original million principal balance of our note payable was increased to million 
the proceeds from this increase were used to pay in full the principal and interest outstanding on another note payable with an original principal balance of approximately million  which resulted in that other note being retired 
in addition to this note retirement  the proceeds from this loan amendment were used to pay the costs related to this transaction and to add  to our cash and cash equivalents 
the amended mortgage note payable bears interest at 
the note is payable in monthly installments of  until may at that time  we may extend the note to a november maturity date 
upon such extension  the interest rate is modified to the lesser of a above the five year us treasury bond note rate or b  and principal and interest on the note become payable in equal monthly installments based on a month amortization period 
the principal balance outstanding on the note s extended maturity date is payable in full at that time 
in october  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of magnum therapeutics corporation magnum  a company owned by one of our executive officers 
we paid approximately million for the magnum stock by issuing approximately  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million at the acquisition date and assuming liabilities of approximately  with respect to the common stock we issued for the acquisition  of the shares are held by an independent escrow agent for a period of one year subsequent to the acquisition date to satisfy the indemnification obligations of the selling shareholder under terms of the purchase agreement 
magnum s primary assets are the right to receive funding under a grant from the national institutes of health 
the grant activities and related funding will supplement research and development programs we have in progress 
during the year ended december   we earned million of revenue under this grant 
in the event certain of magnum s technologies result in commercial products  we may be obligated to pay royalties related to the sales of those products to certain third parties 
the results of magnum s operations have been included with those of the company for the period subsequent to the acquisition date 
since magnum is a development stage company  this acquisition has been accounted for as an asset acquisition and not a business combination 
the total purchase consideration has been allocated to the assets acquired based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
the following presents the fair value of the net assets acquired in thousands cash and cash equivalents acquired grant rights in december  we sold approximately million shares of our common stock in a direct equity offering pursuant to a shelf registration for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million

these warrants are exercisable beginning december and expire in december 
table of contents we have a small business technology transfer grant from the national cancer institute to support our phase clinical trial of ingn in patients with metastatic melanoma 
provided we perform the work and incur the costs contemplated by this grant  it will provide up to million of aggregate funding in future periods during the course of this clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and biologic activity of ingn in this indication 
magnum  our wholly owned subsidiary  has a small business innovation research grant from the national institutes of health for the development of complementary adenoviral vectors for the treatment of cancer 
provided we perform the work and incur the costs contemplate by this grant  it will provide up to million of aggregate funding in future periods 
critical accounting policies use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments include investments in short term  investment grade securities  which currently consist primarily of united states federal government obligations 
these investments are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
at any point in time  amortized costs may be greater or less than fair value 
if investments are sold prior to maturity  we could incur a realized gain or loss based on the fair market value of the investments at the date of sale 
we could incur future losses on investments if the investment issuer becomes impaired or the investment is downgraded 
research and development costs 
in conducting our clinical trials of advexin therapy and other product candidates  we procure services from numerous third party vendors 
the cost of these services constitutes a significant portion of the cost of these trials and of our research and development expenses in general 
these vendors do not necessarily provide us billings for their services on a regular basis and  accordingly  are often not a timely source of information to determine the costs we have incurred relative to their services for any given accounting period 
as a result  we make significant accounting estimates as to the amount of costs we have incurred relative to these vendors in each accounting period 
these estimates are based on numerous factors  including  among others  costs set forth in our contracts with these vendors  the period of time over which the vendor will render the services and the rate of enrollment of patients in our clinical trials 
using these estimates  we record expenses and accrued liabilities in each accounting period that we believe fairly represent our obligations to these vendors 
actual results could differ from these estimates  resulting in increases or decreases in the amount of expense recorded and the related accrual 
we have consistently applied these estimation procedures in the past and plan to continue applying such procedures in the same manner during the foreseeable future 
our experience has been that our estimates have reasonably reflected the expenses we actually incur 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  sfas r  share based payment  was issued 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity investments for goods and services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
the statement does not change the accounting guidance for share based payments with parties other than employees 
the statement requires measurement of the cost of employee service received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award  with limited exceptions 
that cost is to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period of the award 
a public entity will initially measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of a liability instrument 
table of contents based on the instrument s current fair value 
the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation over that period 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of these instruments 
the company will be required to comply with this pronouncement for periods beginning after june  we have not yet determined which fair value method and transitional provision we will follow 
we expect the adoption of sfas r could have a significant impact on our results of operations  but do not expect such adoption to significantly impact our financial position or liquidity 
see stock based compensation in note to our financial statements for the pro forma impact on net loss and net loss per share from calculating stock based compensation costs under the fair value alternative of sfas however  the calculation of compensation cost for share based payment transactions after the effective date of sfas r may be different from the calculation of compensation cost under sfas  but such differences have not yet been quantified 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues contract services  grant and other revenue 
in the and periods  we earned revenue from a research grants from us government agencies and b contract research services provided to aventis  one of our stockholders  under an agreement through which aventis provided funding for the conduct of a phase clinical trial of advexin therapy in breast cancer 
in the period  we also earned contract services revenues from third parties under agreements to provide manufacturing process development services and to produce products for them 
total contract services  grant and other revenue was million in and  in  an increase of 
this increase was primarily due to increased grant funding earned under our small business technology transfer grant from the national cancer institute to support our phase clinical trial of ingn in patients with metastatic melanoma as a result of our increased activity related to that research and the small business innovation research grant held by magnum  our wholly owned subsidiary  as a result of our acquisition of magnum in october during  we earned million under the grant held by magnum 
costs and expenses research and development 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in these expenses included compensation related to the issuance of stock options of  in and  in this increase in research and development expenses is a result of increased activity related to the preparation of the biologics license application bla for advexin therapy for filing with the fda  which resulted in us hiring more employees and engaging additional consultants to perform this work 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in these expenses included compensation related to the issuance of stock options of  in and million in this increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased activity related to the preparation of the bla for advexin therapy for filing with the fda  which resulted in us hiring more employees and engaging additional consultants to perform this work 
also  in the period  we expensed  of costs incurred with respect to certain securities offering activities for the sale of our common stock during the first two quarters of that did not result in a closing of a sale of common stock 

table of contents compensation related to the issuance of stock options 
compensation related to the issuance of stock options was  in and million in this compensation for the period arose primarily as a result of stock options granted to certain members of our board of directors for which some of the options were fully vested upon issuance and had exercise prices below the market value of our common stock at the date of grant  which resulted in compensation expense  stock options  which were fully vested upon issuance  issued to our corporate secretary  who is not a director or employee and for whom option grants result in compensation charges under fair value accounting  and amortization of deferred compensation remaining from stock options granted in earlier periods 
this compensation expense decreased in the period because the options granted to members of our board of directors during the period had exercise prices equal to the market value of our common stock at the date of grant  resulting in no compensation expense  the options granted to our corporate secretary during the period vest over multiple periods  resulting in recognition of some of the compensation expense arising from those options being deferred to future periods  and deferred compensation related to previously granted stock options became fully amortized in previous periods 
the amount of stock option compensation expense to be recorded in future periods may increase if additional options are issued at a price below the market price of common stock at the date of grant  the market value of our stock increases or additional options are granted to individuals or entities other than employees or directors 
this compensation expense may decrease if unvested options for which deferred compensation has been recorded are subsequently forfeited or as previously recorded deferred compensation becomes fully amortized 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  allows companies to adopt one of two methods for accounting for stock options 
we have elected the method that requires disclosure only of stock based compensation 
because of this election  we continue to account for our employee stock based compensation plans  using the intrinsic value method  under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as clarified by interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
accordingly  deferred compensation is recorded for stock based compensation grants based on the excess of the fair market value of the common stock on the measurement date over the exercise price 
the deferred compensation is amortized ratably over the vesting period of each unit of stock based compensation grant  generally four years 
if the exercise price of the stock based compensation grants is equal to the fair value of our stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recorded 
interest income  interest expense and other income interest income was  in compared to million in  a decrease of 
included in the amount is  we received from the settlement of litigation related to a decline in the market value of certain commercial paper we held as an investment in excluding the amount from this settlement  interest income for was  interest income in increased compared to interest income in  exclusive of the litigation settlement  primarily due to higher average cash balances during the period as a result of the proceeds received from the sales of our common stock in december and december and higher yields on invested funds in compared to interest expense was  in compared to  in  a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to certain capital leases becoming fully paid in late and early 
table of contents other income was million in and this income is earned primary from our sublease of space to m 
d 
anderson cancer center under which there were no significant changes between the and periods 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues contract services  grant and other revenue 
total contract services  grant and other revenue was  in and million in  a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to a decline in the level of our contract manufacturing activity due to the completion of work under services agreements with certain third parties during  which was not replaced with new contract manufacturing work due to our focus during on the preparation of regulatory filings for advexin therapy and development of our other product candidates  and a decrease in contract services revenue earned from aventis as the initial portion of the phase clinical trial of advexin therapy in breast cancer approached completion 
costs and expenses research and development 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in this expense included compensation related to the issuance of stock options of  in and  in this decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to cost control programs implemented during that reduced the rate at which we used cash for operations 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in and were million in this expense included compensation related to the issuance of stock options of million in and  in this decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to cost control programs implemented during that reduced the rate at which we used cash for operations 
compensation related to the issuance of stock options 
compensation related to the issuance of stock options was million in and million in even though compensation expense related to certain stock options granted in previous periods declined due to deferred compensation related to those stock options becoming fully amortized during  total stock option compensation expense was relatively unchanged between years due to stock options granted in to certain members of our board of directors for which some of the options have exercise prices below the market value of our common stock at the date of grant and were fully vested upon issuance  and our corporate secretary  who is not a director or employee and for whom options grants are subject to fair value accounting 
interest income  interest expense and other income interest income was million in compared to  in  an increase of 
included in the amount is  we received from the settlement of litigation related to a decline in the market value of certain commercial paper we held as an investment in and excluding the amount from this settlement  interest income for was  which decreased compared to interest income for  due to our lower average cash and cash equivalents balances during and declining interest rates 
interest expense was  in compared to  in  a decrease of 
this decrease was a result of lower principal amounts upon which interest was incurred in compared to as a result of continuing debt service payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations 
other income was million in both and this income consists primarily of rental income related to our sublease of space in our facilities to m 
d 
anderson cancer center  under which there were no significant changes between the and years 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have incurred annual operating losses since our inception  and at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
from inception through december   we have financed our operations primarily from the following sources million of collaborative research and development payments from aventis  million of equity sales in december and december through registered direct offerings under a shelf registration filed with the securities and exchange commission  million of private equity sales to aventis  million of net proceeds from our initial public offering in october  million of private equity sales  net of offering costs  to others including million from the private sale of our common stock in june million from contract services  grants  interest and other income  million in mortgage financing from banks for our facilities  million of sales of advexin therapy product to aventis for use in later stage clinical trials  and million in leases and notes payable from commercial lessors and lenders to acquire equipment pledged as collateral for those leases and notes 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  compared to million at december  cash and cash equivalents constituted million and million of these amounts at december   and december   respectively 
this decrease in cash and cash equivalents at december   as compared to december  was due to million of cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities during  and million of cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities  offset by million of cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities 
we expect to continue to focus our activities primarily on conducting phase and other clinical trials  conducting data analysis  preparing regulatory documentation submissions to the fda and conducting pre marketing activities for advexin therapy 
we expect to continue our research and development of various other gene based technologies 
if advexin therapy or any of our other product candidates are approved for commercial sale by the fda  we expect to conduct activities supporting the marketing  sales  production and distribution of those products  either ourselves or in collaboration with other parties 
the majority of our expenditures for the foreseeable future will most likely be for these activities as they relate to advexin therapy 
these activities may increase the rate at which we use cash in the future as compared to the cash we used for operating activities during the year ended december  we believe our existing working capital can fund our operations for the next to months  although we may have to make adjustments to the scope of operations to achieve that objective and unforeseen events could shorten that time period 
our existing resources may not be sufficient to support the commercial introduction of any of our product candidates 
in order to fund our operating losses  we will need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we do not know whether such additional financing will be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
net cash used in operating activities was million in compared to million in this increase was due to a larger net loss during the period compared to the period  which was increased by an increase in other assets during the period as a result of an increase in a grant revenue earned not yet received in cash  b prepayment for work performed by third parties under research agreements and c prepaid insurance due to higher insurance premiums  all of which compares to a decrease 
table of contents in other assets during the period that arose primarily as a result of a change in the terms of certain insurance policies that reduced the amount of premium prepayments at that time  and decreased by lower depreciation during the period compared to the period as accelerated depreciation methods result in lower depreciation charges as property and equipment ages  lower compensation related to stock options in the period compared to the period for the reasons discussed above under costs and expenses compensation related to the issuance of stock options  a larger increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the period compared to the period due to a higher level of operating activity and expenses resulting in increased liabilities to be paid in the future  and an increase in deferred revenue that was comparable between periods due to no change of significance related to the tenants to whom we sublease space in our facility 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to  in this increase was primarily due to increased property and equipment purchases to support the ongoing needs of our business  and resumption during the first quarter of of our investments in financial instruments with original maturities in excess of three months  primarily as a result of cash from the sale of shares of our common stock in december being available for such investments 
we have no obligations at this time to purchase significant amounts of additional property or equipment  but our needs may change 
it may be necessary for us to purchase larger amounts of property and equipment to support our clinical programs and other research  development and manufacturing activities 
we may need to obtain debt or lease financing to facilitate such purchases 
if that financing is not available  we may need to use our existing resources to fund those purchases  which could result in a reduction in the cash and cash equivalents available to fund operating activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in this decrease was due to the amount including million of net proceeds from the sale of million shares of our common stock in december  whereas the amount includes million of net proceeds from the sale of million shares of our common stock in june and million of net proceeds from the sale of million shares of our common stock in december  increased borrowings under notes payable during the period primarily as a result of a proceeds received during the period from the refinancing of the mortgage note payable related to our facilities and b borrowings under notes payable during the period to finance the increased purchases of equipment  decreased principal payments under capital lease obligations and notes payable in the period as a result of a significant portion of our capital lease obligations becoming paid in full during the period 
we have an agreement with virrx  which began in  to purchase shares of virrx s series a preferred stock 
key activity and provisions under this agreement include the following from inception of this agreement through december   and during the year ended december   we have purchased  and  respectively  of virrx s series a preferred stock for cash 
these purchases are recorded as research and development expense 
we have agreed to purchase an additional  of this stock for cash on the first day of each quarter through january  
table of contents virrx is required to use the proceeds from these stock sales in accordance with the terms of a collaboration and license agreement between virrx and us for the development of virrx s technologies 
we may unilaterally terminate this collaboration and license agreement with days prior notice  which would also terminate the requirement for us to make any additional stock purchases 
provided the collaboration and license agreement remains in place  we are required to make additional milestone stock purchases  either for cash or through the issuance of our common stock  upon the completion of phase  phase and phase clinical trials involving technologies licensed under this agreement 
we are required to make a million cash milestone payment to virrx  for which we receive no virrx stock  upon approval by the fda of a bla for the first collaboration product based on these technologies 
to the extent we have already made cash milestone payments  we may receive a credit of of the phase clinical trial milestone payments and of the phase clinical trial milestone payments against this million cash milestone payment 
the additional milestone stock purchases and cash payment are not anticipated to be required in the near future 
we have an option to purchase all outstanding shares of virrx at any time until march we have fixed debt service obligations under notes payable for which the liability is reflected on our balance sheet 
we used the proceeds from these notes payable to finance facilities and equipment 
aggregate payments due under these obligations are as follows in thousands total debt service payments due during the year ending december thereafter total debt service payments less portion representing interest total principal balance at december  principal balance presented on the december  balance sheet as liabilities in these categories current portion of notes payable notes payable  net of current portion total principal balance at december  we have a fixed rent obligation under a ground lease for the land on which we built our facilities 
since this is an operating lease  there is no liability reflected on our balance sheet for this item  which is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we make total annual rent payments of  under this lease which will continue until the expiration of the initial term of this lease in september future annual rental payments due under all operating leases are as follows in thousands year ending december  thereafter total minimum lease payments under operating leases

table of contents risk factors if we are unable to commercialize advexin therapy in various markets for multiple indications  particularly for the treatment of head and neck cancer  our business will be harmed 
our ability to achieve and sustain operating profitability depends on our ability to successfully commercialize advexin therapy in various markets for multiple indications  which depends in large part on our ability to commence  execute and complete clinical programs and obtain regulatory approvals for advexin therapy and other drug candidates 
in particular  our ability to achieve and sustain profitability will depend in large part on our ability to commercialize advexin therapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer in the united states 
we cannot assure you we will receive approval for advexin therapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer or other types of cancer or indications in the united states or in other countries or if approved that we will achieve significant level of sales 
if we are unable to do so  our business will be harmed 
if we fail to comply with fda requirements or encounter delays or difficulties in clinical trials for our product candidates  we may not obtain regulatory approval of some or all of our product candidates on a timely basis  if at all 
in order to commercialize our product candidates  we must obtain certain regulatory approvals 
satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years  and involves compliance with requirements covering research and development  testing  manufacturing  quality control  labeling and promotion of drugs for human use 
to obtain regulatory approvals  we must  among other requirements  complete clinical trials demonstrating our product candidates are safe and effective for a particular cancer type or other disease 
regulatory approval of a new drug is never guaranteed 
the fda has substantial discretion in the approval process 
despite the time and experience exerted  failure can occur at any stage  and we could encounter problems causing us to abandon clinical trials 
we have completed three phase clinical trials and are conducting two phase clinical trials of our lead product candidate  advexin therapy  for the treatment of head and neck cancer 
in addition  we have completed a phase clinical trial of advexin therapy for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer and are conducting a phase clinical trial of advexin therapy for the treatment of breast cancer 
we also are conducting or have conducted several phase and phase clinical trials of advexin therapy for other types of cancer 
current or future clinical trials may demonstrate advexin therapy is neither safe nor effective 
while we have completed enrollment of patients with metastatic melanoma in a phase early phase clinical trial of ingn  a product candidate based on the mda gene  and have initiated a follow on phase clinical trial of ingn for the same indication  our most significant clinical trial activity and experience has been with advexin therapy 
we will need to continue conducting significant research and animal testing  referred to as pre clinical testing  to support performing clinical trials for our other product candidates 
it will take us many years to complete pre clinical testing and clinical trials  and failure could occur at any stage of testing 
current or future clinical trials may demonstrate ingn or our other product candidates are neither safe nor effective 
any delays or difficulties we encounter in our pre clinical research and clinical trials  in particular the phase clinical trials of advexin therapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer  may delay or preclude regulatory approval 
our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or regulatory approvals or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned 
any delay or preclusion could also delay or preclude the commercialization of advexin therapy or any other product candidates 
in addition  we or the fda might delay or halt any of our clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons  including the product candidate is less effective and or more toxic than current therapies  the presence of unforeseen adverse side effects of a product candidate  including its delivery system  a longer than expected time required to determine whether or not a product candidate is effective  
table of contents the death of patients during a clinical trial  even if the product candidate did not cause those deaths  the failure to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials  the inability to produce sufficient quantities of a product candidate to complete the trials  or the inability to commit the necessary resources to fund the clinical trials 
we cannot be certain the results we observed in our pre clinical testing will be confirmed in clinical trials or the results of any of our clinical trials will support fda approval 
pre clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in many different ways  and fda officials could interpret differently data we consider promising  which could halt or delay our clinical trials or prevent regulatory approval 
despite the fda s designation of advexin therapy as a fast track product  we may encounter delays in the regulatory approval process due to additional information requirements from the fda  unintentional omissions in our bla for advexin therapy  or other delays in the fda s review process 
we may encounter delays or rejections in the regulatory approval process because of additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in fda policy during the period of product development  clinical trials and fda regulatory review 
despite our submission of a bla for advexin therapy under the fda s accelerated approval regulations  the fda could determine that accelerated approval is not warranted and that a traditional bla filing must be made 
such a determination could delay regulatory approval 
additionally  accelerated approval of an application could be subject to phase or post approval studies to validate the surrogate endpoint or confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint 
failure to validate a surrogate endpoint or confirm a clinical benefit during post marketing studies could cause the product to be withdrawn from the market by the fda on an expedited basis 
even if our products are approved by regulatory authorities  if we fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements  or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products  these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market 
any product for which we obtain marketing approval  along with the manufacturing processes  post approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product  will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory bodies 
even if regulatory approval of a product is granted  the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or certain requirements for costly post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product 
later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products  including unanticipated adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  manufacturer or manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements  may result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes  withdrawal of the products from the market  voluntary or mandatory recall  fines  suspension of regulatory approvals  product seizures or detention  injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties 
failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs could prevent us from selling our products in foreign markets  which may adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions 
for marketing drugs and biologics outside the united states  the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country and may require additional testing 
the time required to obtain approvals outside the united states may differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
we may not obtain foreign regulatory approval on a timely basis  if at all 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries  and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the fda 
failure to comply with these regulatory requirements or to obtain required approvals could impair our ability to develop these markets and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we have a history of operating losses  expect to incur significant additional operating losses and may never become profitable 
we have generated operating losses since we began operations in june as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses and losses over the next several years as our research  development  pre clinical testing and clinical trial activities increase 
as we expand our operations and develop systems to support commercialization of our product candidates  these losses  among other things  have had  and are expected to continue to have  an adverse impact on our total assets  stockholders equity and working capital 
we have no products that have generated any commercial revenue 
presently  we earn minimal revenue from contract services activities  grants  interest income and rent from the lease of a portion of our facilities to m 
d 
anderson cancer center 
we do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of products in the near future  and we may never generate revenues from the commercial sale of products 
if we continue to incur operating losses for a period longer than we anticipate and fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations  we will be unable to advance our development program and complete our clinical trials 
developing a new drug and conducting clinical trials is expensive 
our product development efforts may not lead to commercial products  either because our product candidates fail to be found safe or effective in clinical trials or because we lack the necessary financial or other resources or relationships to pursue our programs through commercialization 
our capital and future revenues may not be sufficient to support the expenses of our operations  the development of commercial infrastructure and the conduct of our clinical trials and pre clinical research 
we expect we will fund our operations over approximately the next to months with our current working capital  which we accumulated primarily from sale of equity securities  income from contract services and research grants  debt financing of equipment acquisitions  the lease of a portion of our facilities to m

anderson cancer center and interest on invested funds 
we may need to raise additional capital sooner  however  under various circumstances  including if we experience an acceleration of the number  size or complexity of our clinical trials  slower than expected progress in developing advexin therapy  ingn or other product candidates  higher than expected costs to obtain regulatory approvals  higher than expected costs to pursue our intellectual property strategy  higher than expected costs to further develop and scale up our manufacturing capability  higher than expected costs to develop our sales and marketing capability  faster than expected rate of progress and cost of our research and development and clinical trial activities  a decrease in the amount and timing of milestone payments we receive from collaborators  higher than expected costs of preparing an application for fda approval of advexin therapy  higher than expected costs of developing the processes and systems to support fda approval of advexin therapy  an increase in our timetable and costs for the development of marketing operations and other activities related to the commercialization of advexin therapy and our other product candidates  a change in the degree of success in our phase clinical trial of advexin therapy and in the clinical trials of our other products  
table of contents the emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments  or changes in or terminations of our existing collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
we may need to raise any necessary funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders will experience dilution 
if we raise funds through debt financings  we may become subject to restrictive covenants 
to the extent we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms not favorable to us 
if we are not able to raise additional funds  we may have to delay  reduce or eliminate our clinical trials and our development programs 
if we cannot maintain our existing corporate and academic arrangements and enter into new arrangements  we may be unable to develop products effectively  or at all 
our strategy for the research  development and commercialization of our product candidates may result in our entering into contractual arrangements with corporate collaborators  academic institutions and others 
we have entered into sponsored research  license and or collaborative arrangements with several entities  including m 
d 
anderson cancer center  the national cancer institute  chiba university in japan  virrx and corixa corporation  as well as numerous other institutions that conduct clinical trials work or perform pre clinical research for us 
our success depends upon our collaborative partners performing their responsibilities under these arrangements and complying with the regulations and requirements governing clinical trials 
we cannot control the amount and timing of resources our collaborative partners devote to our research and testing programs or product candidates  or their compliance with regulatory requirements which can vary because of factors unrelated to such programs or product candidates 
these relationships may in some cases be terminated at the discretion of our collaborative partners with only limited notice to us 
we may not be able to maintain our existing arrangements  enter into new arrangements or negotiate current or new arrangements on acceptable terms  if at all 
some of our collaborative partners may also be researching competing technologies independently from us to treat the diseases targeted by our collaborative programs 
if we are not able to create effective collaborative marketing relationships  we may be unable to market advexin therapy successfully or in a cost effective manner 
to effectively market our products  we will need to develop sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
in order to develop or otherwise obtain these capabilities  we may have to enter into marketing  distribution or other similar arrangements with third parties in order to sell  market and distribute our products successfully 
to the extent we enter into any such arrangements with third parties  our product revenues are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold our products  and any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties 
we have no experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and we currently have no sales  marketing or distribution capability 
we may be unable to develop sufficient sales  marketing and distribution capabilities to commercialize our products successfully 
serious and unexpected side effects attributable to gene therapy may result in governmental authorities imposing additional regulatory requirements or a negative public perception of our products 
advexin therapy and most of our other product candidates under development could be broadly described as gene therapies 
a number of clinical trials are being conducted by other pharmaceutical companies involving gene therapy  including compounds similar to  or competitive with  our product candidates 
the announcement of adverse results from these clinical trials  such as serious unwanted and unexpected side effects attributable to treatment  or any response by the fda to such clinical trials  may impede the timing of our clinical trials  delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval or negatively influence public perception of our product candidates  which could harm our business and results of operations and depress the value of our stock 

table of contents the united states senate has held hearings concerning the adequacy of regulatory oversight of gene therapy clinical trials  as well as the adequacy of research subject education and protection in clinical research in general  and to determine whether additional legislation is required to protect volunteers and patients who participate in such clinical trials 
the recombinant dna advisory committee  or rac  which acts as an advisory body to the national institutes of health  has expanded its public role in evaluating important public and ethical issues in gene therapy clinical trials 
implementation of any additional review and reporting procedures or other additional regulatory measures could increase the costs of or prolong our product development efforts or clinical trials 
we report to the fda and other regulatory agencies serious adverse events  including those we believe may be reasonably related to the treatments administered in our clinical trials 
such serious adverse events  whether treatment related or not  could result in negative public perception of our treatments and require additional regulatory review or measures  which could increase the cost of or prolong our clinical trials 
the fda has not approved any gene therapy product or gene induced product for sale in the united states 
the commercial success of our products will depend in part on public acceptance of the use of gene therapy products or gene induced products  which are a new type of disease treatment for the prevention or treatment of human diseases 
public attitudes may be influenced by claims that gene therapy products or gene induced products are unsafe  and these treatment methodologies may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community 
negative public reaction to gene therapy products or gene induced products could also result in greater government regulation and stricter clinical trial oversight 
we cannot predict the safety profile of the use of advexin therapy when used in combination with other therapies 
many of our trials involve the use of advexin therapy in combination with other drugs or therapies 
while the data we have evaluated to date suggest advexin therapy does not increase the adverse effects of other therapies  we cannot predict if this outcome will continue to be true or whether possible adverse side effects not directly attributable to the other drugs will compromise the safety profile of advexin therapy when used in certain combination therapies 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts to develop competing drugs 
our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining patent protection for our products and other technologies and successfully defending these patents against third party challenges 
our patent position  like that of other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  is highly uncertain 
one uncertainty is the united states patent and trademark office  or pto  or the courts  may deny or significantly narrow claims made under patents issued to us or patent applications we file 
this is particularly true for patent applications or patents that concern biotechnology and pharmaceutical technologies  such as ours  since the pto and the courts often consider these technologies to involve unpredictable sciences 
another uncertainty is any patents that may be issued or licensed to us may not provide any competitive advantage to us because they may not effectively preclude others from developing and marketing products like ours 
also  our patents may be successfully challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future 
in addition  our competitors  many of which have substantial resources and have made significant investments in competing technologies  may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use and sell our potential products either in the united states or in international markets 
our ability to develop and protect a competitive position based on our biotechnological innovations  innovations involving genes  gene induced therapeutic protein agents  viruses for delivering the genes to cells  formulations  gene therapy delivery systems not involving viruses  and the like  is particularly uncertain 
due to the unpredictability of the biotechnological sciences  the pto  as well as patent offices in other jurisdictions  has often required patent applications concerning biotechnology related inventions to be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application  thereby limiting their scope of protection against competitive challenges 
similarly  courts have invalidated or 
table of contents significantly narrowed many key patents in the biotechnology industry 
thus  even if we are able to obtain patents covering commercially significant innovations  our patents may not be upheld or our patents may be substantially narrowed 
through our exclusive license from the university of texas system for technology developed at m 
d 
anderson cancer center  we have obtained and are currently seeking further patent protection for adenoviral p  including advexin therapy  and its use in cancer therapy 
further  the pto issued us a united states patent for our adenovirus production technology as well as a related patent for purified adenoviral compositions 
we also control  through licensing arrangements  four issued united states patents for combination therapy involving the p gene and conventional chemotherapy or radiation  two issued united states patents covering the use of adenoviral p in cancer therapy  one issued united states patent covering adenoviral p as a product  one issued united states patent covering the core dna of adenoviral p  one issued patent covering pharmaceutical compositions of adenoviral p and clinical applications of such pharmaceutical compositions  as well as three patents covering our mda technology 
our competitors may challenge the validity of one or more of our patents in the courts or through an administrative procedure known as an interference  in which the pto determines the priority of invention where two or more parties are claiming the same invention 
the courts or the pto may not uphold the validity of our patents  we may not prevail in such interference proceedings regarding our patents and none of our patents may give us a competitive advantage 
in this regard  we have been notified by the pto that an unidentified third party is attempting to provoke an interference with one of our patents directed to adenoviral p therapy 
we do not at present know the identity of this party and cannot assess the likelihood of an interference actually being declared 
should that party prevail in an interference proceeding  a patent may issue to that party that is infringed by  and therefore potentially preclude our commercialization of  products like advexin therapy that are used for adenoviral p therapy 
schering plough has filed with the european patent office  or epo  an opposition against our european patent directed to combination therapy with p and conventional chemotherapy and or radiation 
an opposition is an administrative proceeding instituted by a third party and conducted by the epo to determine whether a patent should be maintained or revoked in part or in whole  based on evidence brought forth by the party opposing the patent 
the epo held an initial oral proceeding in october and determined our patent should be maintained as amended 
schering plough has appealed this decision 
resolution of this appeal will require we expend time  effort and money 
if schering plough ultimately prevails in having our european patent revoked on appeal  then the scope of our protection for our product in europe will be reduced 
we would not expect  however  such a result to have a significant detrimental impact on our commercialization efforts in europe 
third party claims of infringement of intellectual property could require us to spend time and money to address the claims and could limit our intellectual property rights 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and companies have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
we are aware of a number of issued patents and patent applications related to gene therapy  the treatment of cancer and the use of the p and other tumor suppressor genes 
schering plough corporation  including its subsidiary canji  inc  controls various united states applications and a european patent and applications  some of which are directed to therapy using the p gene  and others to adenoviruses containing the p gene  or adenoviral p  and to methods for carrying out therapy using adenoviral p adenoviral p technology underlies our advexin therapy product candidate 
furthermore  we are aware of a united states patent directed to replication deficient recombinant adenoviral vectors apparently controlled by transgene sa 
while we believe the claims of the transgene adenoviral vector patent are invalid or not infringed by our products  transgene could assert a claim against us 
one of the foregoing patent applications directed to p therapy  which we understand is owned by the johns hopkins university and controlled by schering plough  was involved in a pto interference proceeding with a patent owned by canji 
this johns hopkins application was the united states counterpart to the european patent recently revoked in its entirety by the epo see below 
priority of invention in that 
table of contents interference was awarded by the pto to the johns hopkins inventors  leading to the issuance of a united states patent  and the canji patent has been found unpatentable 
while it is our belief that the claims of the johns hopkins patent are invalid and not infringed by our advexin therapy  schering plough or johns hopkins may assert that our advexin therapy  which uses p therapy  infringes the claims of such patent 
while we believe we would have both an invalidity and non infringement defense against such an assertion  in the united states an issued patent enjoys a presumption of validity  which can be overcome only through clear and convincing evidence 
we cannot assure you such a defense would prevail 
we may also become subject to infringement claims or litigation arising out of other patents and pending applications of our competitors  if they issue  or additional interference proceedings declared by the pto to determine the priority of inventions 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  pto interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly and time consuming to pursue  and their outcome is uncertain 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our issued patents  to protect our trade secrets and know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
an adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities  require us to obtain licenses from third parties  or restrict or prevent us from selling our products in certain markets 
although patent and intellectual property disputes are often settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  the necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in particular  if we were found to infringe a valid claim of the transgene adenoviral vector united states patent  the johns hopkins patent or a patent that may issue from a currently pending application  our business could be materially harmed 
we have recently been involved in patent opposition proceedings before the epo  in which we have sought to have the epo revoke three different european patents owned or controlled by canji schering plough 
these european patents relate to the use of a p gene  or the use of tumor suppressor genes  in the preparation of therapeutic products 
in one opposition involving a canji european patent directed to the use of a tumor suppressor gene  the epo revoked the european patent in its entirety in a final  non appealable decision 
in the second opposition  involving a patent that is directed to therapeutic and other applications of the p gene and that is owned by johns hopkins and  we understand  controlled by schering plough  the epo recently revoked the patent in its entirety 
the patent owner has appealed this decision and a final hearing before the epo technical board of appeals is scheduled for june of in a third case involving the use of a p gene  the european patent at issue was initially upheld  but finally revoked in a hearing held in late april that revocation is also final  and non appealable 
if we do not ultimately prevail in the one remaining appeal involving the revoked johns hopkins patent  our competitors could seek to assert their rights by means of litigation to limit or stop european commercial activities involving our potential products 
if our competitors are successful in any such litigation  it could have a significant detrimental effect on our ability to commercialize our potential commercial products in europe 
we may be subject to litigation and infringement claims that may be costly  divert management s attention  and materially harm our business 
extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights has been common in the biopharmaceutical industry 
litigation may be necessary to assert infringement claims  enforce patent rights  protect trade secrets or know how and determine the enforceability  scope and validity of certain proprietary rights 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property lawsuits  pto interference proceedings  and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states and internationally involve complex legal and factual questions 
as a result  such proceedings are costly and time consuming to pursue and their outcome is uncertain 
regardless of merit or outcome  our involvement in any litigation  interference or other administrative proceedings could cause us to incur substantial expense and could significantly divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination may subject us to the loss of our proprietary position or to significant liabilities  or require us to seek licenses that may include substantial cost and ongoing royalties 
licenses may not be available from third parties  or may not be obtainable on satisfactory terms 
an 
table of contents adverse determination or a failure to obtain necessary licenses may restrict or prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products  if any 
these outcomes could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to meet our obligations under license agreements  we may lose our rights to key technologies on which our business depends 
our business depends in part on patents licensed from third parties 
those third party license agreements impose obligations on us  such as payment obligations and obligations to diligently pursue development of commercial products under the licensed patents 
if a licensor believes we have failed to meet our obligations under a license agreement  the licensor could seek to limit or terminate our license rights  which could lead to costly and time consuming litigation and  potentially  a loss of the licensed rights 
during the period of any such litigation  our ability to carry out the development and commercialization of product candidates could be significantly and negatively affected 
if our license rights were restricted or ultimately lost  our ability to continue our business based on the affected technology platform would be severely adversely affected 
competition and technological change may make our product candidates and technologies less attractive or obsolete 
we compete with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including canji  inc and genvec  inc  which are pursuing forms of treatment similar to ours for the diseases advexin therapy and our other product candidates target 
we are aware canji  with its parent schering plough  has in the past been involved in research and or development of adenoviral p products and has numerous patents and patent applications relating to adenoviral p therapy 
we understand schering plough has stopped its adenoviral p clinical trials  and it is unknown whether these parties are continuing their adenoviral p research and or development efforts 
we are also aware a chinese pharmaceutical company  sibiono genetech  inc  has recently announced it has received regulatory approval from the chinese drug regulatory agency to market an adenoviral p product only in china 
we control an issued chinese patent covering adenoviral p  and a number of pending chinese applications directed to p therapy and adenoviral production 
we do not at present know whether sibiono s adenoviral p product is covered by patent protection or whether it infringes our chinese patent or pending applications 
we understand enforcement of patents in china is unpredictable and we do not know if monetary damages could be recovered from sibiono genetech if its product infringes our patent or patent applications 
patent enforcement and respect of international patent standards  rules and laws have not historically been a key characteristic of the chinese government and patent system 
further  geopolitical developments  including trade and tariff disputes between the government of china and the united states department of commerce could add additional uncertainty to any effort to enforce patents  recover damages  if any  or engage in the sales and marketing of patented or non patented products in china 
we also may face competition from companies that may develop internally or acquire competing technology from universities and other research institutions 
as these companies develop or acquire their technologies  they may develop competitive positions that may prevent or limit our product commercialization efforts 
some of our competitors are established companies with greater financial and other resources than ours 
other companies may succeed in developing products earlier than we do  obtaining fda approval for products before we do or developing products that are more effective than our product candidates 
while we will seek to expand our technological capabilities to remain competitive  research and development by others may render our technology or product candidates obsolete or non competitive or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy developed by us 

table of contents even if we receive regulatory approval to market our advexin therapy  ingn  ingn or other product candidates  we may not be able to commercialize them profitably 
our profitability will depend on the market s acceptance of advexin therapy  ingn  ingn  if approved  and our other product candidates 
the commercial success of our product candidates will depend on whether they are more effective than alternative treatments  their side effects are acceptable to patients and doctors  insurers and other third party healthcare payers will provide adequate reimbursement for them  we produce and sell them at a profit  and we market advexin therapy  ingn  ingn and other product candidates effectively 
because the target patient populations for the primary indication of advexin therapy  our lead product candidate  are small  we must achieve significant market share and obtain high per patient prices for our products to achieve profitability 
advexin therapy  our lead product candidate for the treatment of recurrent squamous cell cancer of the head and neck  targets diseases with small patient populations 
as a result  our per patient prices must be relatively high in order to recover our development costs and achieve profitability 
we estimate the annual incidence for squamous cell cancer of the head and neck is  patients in the united states 
we believe we will need to market worldwide to achieve significant market penetration 
in addition  we are developing other drug candidates to treat cancers with small patient populations 
due to the expected costs of treatment for advexin therapy  we may be unable to obtain sufficient market share for our drug products at a price high enough to continue our product development efforts 
if we are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities or obtain regulatory approvals for our manufacturing facilities  or if our manufacturing process is found to infringe a valid patented process or processes of another company  then we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenues 
to complete our clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates  if approved  we will need access to  or development of  facilities to manufacture a sufficient supply of our product candidates 
we have used manufacturing facilities we constructed in houston  texas to manufacture advexin therapy  ingn and other product candidates for currently planned clinical trials 
we anticipate our facilities are suitable for the initial commercial launch of advexin therapy 
we have no experience manufacturing advexin therapy  ingn or any other product candidates in the volumes necessary to support commercial sales 
if we are unable to manufacture our product candidates in clinical or  when necessary  commercial quantities  then we will need to rely on third party manufacturers to produce our products for clinical and commercial purposes 
these third party manufacturers must receive fda approval before they can produce clinical material or commercial product 
our products may be in competition with other products for access to these facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if third parties give other products greater priority than ours 
in addition  we may not be able to enter into any necessary third party manufacturing arrangements on acceptable terms 
there are a limited number of contract manufacturers who currently have the capability to produce advexin therapy  ingn or our other product candidates  and the inability of any of these contract manufacturers to deliver our required quantities of product candidates timely and at commercially reasonable prices would negatively affect our operations 
before we can begin commercially manufacturing advexin therapy  ingn or any other product candidate  we must obtain regulatory approval of our manufacturing facilities and process 
manufacturing of our product candidates for clinical and commercial purposes must comply with the fda s cgmp requirements  and foreign regulatory requirements 
the cgmp requirements govern quality control and documentation policies and procedures 
in complying with cgmp and foreign regulatory requirements  we 
table of contents will be obligated to expend time  money and effort in production  record keeping and quality control to assure the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements 
we must also pass a fda inspection prior to fda approval 
our current manufacturing facilities have not yet been subject to an fda or other regulatory inspection 
failure to pass a pre approval inspection may significantly delay fda approval of our products 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products 
further  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities have the authority to perform unannounced periodic inspections of our manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with cgmp and foreign regulatory requirements 
our facilities in houston  texas are our only manufacturing facilities 
if these facilities were to incur significant damage or destruction  then our ability to manufacture advexin therapy  ingn or any other product candidates would be significantly hampered  and our pre clinical testing  clinical trials and commercialization efforts would be delayed 
in order to produce our products in the quantities we believe will be required to meet anticipated market demand  if our products are approved  we will need to increase  or scale up  our production process 
if we are unable to do so  or if the cost of this scale up is not economically viable to us  we may not be able to produce our products in a sufficient quantity to meet the requirements of future demand 
canji controls a united states patent and the corresponding international applications  including a european counterpart  relating to the purification of viral or adenoviral compositions 
while we believe our manufacturing process does not infringe this patent  canji could still assert a claim against us 
we may also become subject to infringement claims or litigation if our manufacturing process infringes upon other patents 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly and time consuming to pursue  and their outcome is uncertain 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for some of our manufacturing materials 
any problems experienced by such suppliers could negatively affect our operations 
we rely on third party suppliers for most of the equipment  materials and supplies used in the manufacturing of advexin therapy  ingn and our other product candidates 
some items critical to the manufacture of these product candidates are available from only a limited number of suppliers or vendors 
we do not have supply agreements with these key suppliers 
to mitigate the related supply risk  we maintain inventories of these items 
any significant problem experienced by one or more of this limited number of suppliers could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of materials to us until the supplier cures the problem or until we locate an alternative source of supply 
such problems would likely lead to a delay or interruption in our manufacturing operations or could require a significant modification to our manufacturing process  which could impair our ability to manufacture our product candidates in a timely manner and negatively affect our operations 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we may incur substantial damages and demand for our product candidates may be reduced 
the testing and marketing of medical products is subject to an inherent risk of product liability claims 
regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  product liability claims may result in decreased demand for our product candidates  injury to our reputation and significant media attention  withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers  substantial delay in fda approval  costs of litigation  and substantial monetary awards to plaintiffs 

table of contents we currently maintain product liability insurance with coverage of million per occurrence with a million annual aggregate limit 
this coverage may not be sufficient to protect us fully against product liability claims 
we intend to expand our product liability insurance coverage beyond clinical trials to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates 
our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against product liability claims could prevent or limit the commercialization of our products 
we use hazardous materials in our business  and any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could harm our business 
our business involves the use of a broad range of hazardous chemicals and materials 
environmental laws impose stringent civil and criminal penalties for improper handling  disposal and storage of these materials 
in addition  in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of  or exposure of individuals to  hazardous materials  we could be subject to civil damages due to personal injury or property damage caused by the release or exposure 
a failure to comply with environmental laws could result in fines and the revocation of environmental permits  which could prevent us from conducting our business 
our stock price may fluctuate substantially 
the market price for our common stock will be affected by a number of factors  including progress and results of our pre clinical and clinical trials  announcement of technological innovations by us or our competitors  developments concerning proprietary rights  including patent and litigation matters  publicity regarding actual or potential results with respect to products under development by us or by our competitors  regulatory developments  the announcement of new products by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  failure to achieve operating results projected by securities analysts  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  developments in our industry  and general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  stock prices for many companies in the technology and emerging growth sectors have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
if we do not progress in our programs as anticipated  our stock price could decrease 
for planning purposes  we estimate the timing of a variety of clinical  regulatory and other milestones  such as when a certain product candidate will enter clinical development  when a clinical trial will be completed or when an application for regulatory approval will be filed 
some of our estimates are included in this annual report on form k 
our estimates are based on present facts and a variety of assumptions 
many of the underlying assumptions are outside of our control 
if milestones are not achieved when we expect them to be  investors could be disappointed  and our stock price may decrease 
any acquisition we might make may be costly and difficult to integrate  may divert management resources or dilute stockholder value 
as part of our business strategy  we may acquire assets or businesses principally relating to or complementary to our current operations  and we have in the past evaluated and discussed such opportunities 
table of contents with interested parties 
any acquisitions we undertake will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in business acquisitions 
these risks include  among other things potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies  the difficulty and expense of assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired businesses  diversion of management time and attention and other resources  loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management  the incurrence of amortization expenses  and possible dilution to our stockholders 
in addition  geographic distances may make the integration of businesses more difficult 
we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional  highly skilled personnel required to develop our products or obtain new collaborations  our business will suffer 
we depend  to a significant extent  on the efforts of our key employees  including senior management and senior scientific  clinical  regulatory  manufacturing and other personnel 
the development of new therapeutic products requires expertise from a number of different disciplines  some of which is not widely available 
we depend upon our scientific staff to discover new product candidates and to develop and conduct pre clinical studies of those new potential products 
our clinical and regulatory staff is responsible for the design and execution of clinical trials in accordance with fda requirements and for the advancement of our product candidates toward fda approval 
our manufacturing staff is responsible for designing and conducting our manufacturing processes in accordance with the fda s cgmp requirements 
the quality and reputation of our scientific  clinical  regulatory and manufacturing staff  especially the senior staff  and their success in performing their responsibilities  are a basis on which we attract potential funding sources and collaborators 
in addition  our chief executive officer and other executive officers are involved in a broad range of critical activities  including providing strategic and operational guidance 
the loss of these individuals  or our inability to retain or recruit other key management and scientific  clinical  regulatory  manufacturing and other personnel  may delay or prevent us from achieving our business objectives 
we face intense competition for personnel from other companies  universities  public and private research institutions  government entities and other organizations 
some of our insiders are parties to transactions with us that may cause conflicting obligations 
dr
