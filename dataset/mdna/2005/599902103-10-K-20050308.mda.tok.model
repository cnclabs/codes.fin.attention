item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations contains forward looking statements  including statements about our growth and future operating results  discovery and development of products  strategic alliances and intellectual property 
for this purpose  any statement that is not a statement of historical fact should be considered a forward looking statement 
we often use the words believe  anticipate  plan  expect  intend  may  will and similar expressions to help identify forward looking statements 
actual results may differ from those indicated by such forward looking statements as a result of various important factors  including  without limitation  those factors discussed in this annual report under the heading risk factors that may affect results 
overview we are a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing breakthrough products in the areas of cancer  cardiovascular disease and inflammatory disease 
we currently market two leading products  one for cancer and one for cardiovascular disease 
we also have other potential therapeutic products in various stages of clinical and preclinical development in all three of our therapeutic areas of disease focus 
we achieved a number of our corporate goals in  including product related revenue growth of over and reduced costs and expenses driven primarily by decreased restructuring charges and decreased research and development expenses 
our financial position remains strong  with million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  in december and june  we took steps to realign our resources to become a commercially focused biopharmaceutical company 
we discontinued specified discovery research efforts  reduced overall headcount  primarily in our discovery group  streamlined our discovery and development projects and consolidated our research and development facilities 
in addition to our two marketed products  velcade and integrilin eptifibatide injection  we have eight drug candidates in development 
our business strategy is to develop and commercialize important new medicines through clinical trials and regulatory approvals and to play a significant role in the marketing and sale of many of these products 
we plan to develop and commercialize many of our products on our own  but will also seek development and commercial collaborators on favorable terms or when we otherwise believe that doing so would be advantageous to us 
our products velcade bortezomib for injection velcade  the first of a new class of medicines called proteasome inhibitors  is the first treatment in more than a decade to be approved in the united states for patients with multiple myeloma 
we received accelerated approval from the food and drug administration  or fda  on may  to market velcade for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least two prior therapies and have demonstrated disease progression on their most recent therapy  commonly referred to as third line and beyond 
the european commission granted marketing authorization for velcade for this same indication in europe in april under this authorization  a single license was granted to millennium for marketing velcade in the member states of the european union  plus norway and iceland 
velcade was also approved for marketing in the ten accession member countries when those countries officially joined the european union on may  velcade has also been approved in a number of other countries  including canada  switzerland  argentina  israel  bulgaria  slovenia  south korea and mexico  bringing the total number of approved countries to approximately in september  we submitted a supplemental new drug application  or snda  to the fda for velcade bortezomib for injection for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy  commonly referred to as second line  based on our completed phase iii apex clinical trial 
also during september  the european medicines evaluation agency  or emea  accepted for review a filing by our collaborator  ortho biotech products  lp  or ortho biotech  for the same second line indication in europe 
the fda granted velcade fast track designation for relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma  an aggressive form of non hodgkin s lymphoma  in november this designation allows the fda to accept on a rolling basis portions of a marketing application for review prior to the submission of a final document 
ortho biotech collaboration in june  we entered into an agreement with ortho biotech to collaborate on the commercialization and continued clinical development of velcade 
under the terms of the agreement  we retain all commercialization rights to velcade in the united states 
ortho biotech and its affiliate  janssen cilag  have agreed to commercialize velcade outside of the united states and janssen pharmaceutical kk is responsible for japan 
we receive distribution fees from ortho biotech and its affiliates from sales of velcade outside of the united states 
we also retain an option to co promote velcade with ortho biotech at a future date in specified european countries 
we are engaged with ortho biotech in an extensive global program for further clinical development of velcade with the purpose of maximizing the clinical and commercial potential of velcade 
this program is investigating the potential of velcade to treat multiple forms of solid and hematological tumors  including continued clinical development of velcade for multiple myeloma 
ortho biotech is responsible for of the joint development costs through and for of those costs after in addition  we may receive payments from ortho biotech for achieving clinical development milestones  regulatory milestones outside of the united states or agreed upon sales levels of velcade 
integrilin eptifibatide injection we co promote integrilin in the united states in collaboration with schering plough corporation and schering plough ltd  together referred to as sgp  and share profits and losses 
glaxosmithkline plc  or gsk  markets integrilin in the european union under a license from us 
pending approval of the transfer from sgp to gsk of the relevant marketing authorizations  gsk will also market integrilin in other european countries 
sgp markets integrilin in specified other areas outside of the united states and the european union 
sgp collaboration in april  cor therapeutics  inc  or cor  entered into a collaboration agreement with sgp to jointly develop and commercialize integrilin on a worldwide basis 
we acquired cor in february under our collaboration agreement with sgp  we generally share any profits or losses from the united states with sgp based on the amount of promotional efforts that each party contributes 
since the united states launch of integrilin in june  we have agreed to share promotional efforts in the united states equally with sgp  except for costs associated with marketing programs specific to us 
we have granted sgp an exclusive license to market integrilin outside of the united states and the european union  and sgp pays royalties to us based on sales outside of the united states and the european union 
during september  we initiated the process  contemplated by our original agreement with sgp  to transition united states distribution responsibilities for integrilin eptifibatide injection from sgp to us 
we expect this transition to take place during the fourth quarter of  at the earliest 
after the transition  we expect we will continue to co promote the product with sgp  but we will be responsible for distributing the product 
as a result  we will recognize revenue for all sales of integrilin in the united states and pay sgp co promotion fees 
gsk license agreement in june  we reacquired the rights to market integrilin in europe from sgp and concurrently entered into a license agreement granting gsk exclusive marketing rights to integrilin in europe 
in january  the transition of the integrilin marketing authorizations for the european union from sgp to gsk was completed  and gsk began selling integrilin in the countries of the european union 
subject to approval of the transfer from sgp to gsk of the relevant marketing authorizations  gsk will also market integrilin in other european countries 
our commercialization alliance with gsk is designed to provide significant sales and marketing support from gsk to address market opportunities for integrilin in europe 
under the terms of the agreement  we are entitled to license fees and royalties from gsk on integrilin sales in europe subject to the achievement of specified objectives 
under the license agreement with gsk  decisions regarding the ongoing marketing of integrilin are generally subject to the oversight of a joint steering committee with equal membership from gsk and us 
however  gsk has significant final decision making authority with respect to european marketing issues 
our agreement with gsk continues until the later of december   or as long as gsk continues to commercialize integrilin in any european country 
research and discovery alliances we have entered into research  development  technology transfer and commercialization arrangements with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies relating to a broad range of therapeutic products 
these alliances provide us with the opportunity to receive various combinations of equity investments  license fees and research funding  and may provide additional payments contingent upon our achievement of research and regulatory milestones and royalties and or share profits if our collaborations are successful in developing and commercializing products 
in addition to our collaboration agreements with ortho biotech  sgp and gsk  our major recent alliances from which we have recognized or may recognize revenues include a june joint development and commercialization agreement with aventis pharmaceuticals  inc  or aventis  in inflammatory diseases 
in april  aventis exercised its option effective july  to terminate a technology transfer agreement with us 
upon exercising this option  aventis paid us million in consideration of future use of technology transferred to aventis prior to the termination date 
termination of the technology transfer agreement has no effect on the existing five year joint development and commercialization agreement in inflammation 
we expect the joint development and commercialization agreement with aventis in the field of inflammatory disease to continue through its scheduled expiration in june a september research agreement with bayer ag  or bayer  in cardiovascular diseases  and specified areas of oncology  pain  hematology  atherosclerosis  thrombosis  urology and viral infections 
in october  the research phase of our five year alliance with bayer concluded 
bayer and we amended the agreement to provide both parties access to specified identified targets for a period of seven years 
if bayer successfully develops and commercializes any of these targets discovered in the alliance  bayer will owe us success and royalty payments on the sale of products generated from the alliance 
we have also entered into a number of arrangements for the commercialization of products under which we share the costs for the development and eventual commercialization of specified compounds and may receive or be obligated to make product revenue  royalty  milestone or other payments 
for example  in april  we entered into an agreement with bzl biologics  llc  or bzl  for the joint development and commercialization of antibody based therapeutics targeting prostate specific membrane antigen  or psma  including both chemotherapeutic agent conjugated and radio labeled products 
these products include mln under this agreement  we currently have exclusive development and worldwide marketing rights to these products 
we are required to pay development costs of the products and milestone and royalty payments to bzl based on product sales 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  intangible assets and goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  our co promotion collaboration and strategic alliances 
we divide our revenue arrangements with multiple elements into separate units of accounting if specified criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
we allocate the consideration we receive among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
we classify advance payments received in excess of amounts earned as deferred revenue until earned 
we recognize revenue from the sales of velcade bortezomib for injection in the united states when delivery has occurred and title has transferred to the wholesalers 
we record allowances as a reduction to product sales for product returns and discounts at the time of sale 
as velcade is a fairly new product  we estimate product returns based on an on going analysis of industry trends for similar products and historical return patterns as they become available 
velcade returns are expected to be generally low because the shelf life for the product is months in the united states and we expect wholesalers not to significantly stock inventory due to the expensive nature of the product 
additionally  we consider several factors in our estimation process including our internal sales forecasts  inventory levels as provided by wholesalers and third party market research data 
during the fourth quarter of  we began distributing velcade bortezomib for injection through a sole source distribution model 
as we continually monitor actual product returns and inventory levels in the domestic distribution channel  if circumstances change or conditions become more competitive in the market for therapeutic products that address multiple myeloma  we may take actions to increase our product return estimates 
doing so would result in an incremental reduction of product sales at the time the return estimate is changed 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced our reserve for product returns by approximately million based upon actual returns to date and inventory levels at the wholesalers 
since product launch  we have made no material revisions to our estimates of other dilution reserves 
accruals for rebates  chargebacks  and other discounts are immaterial as a result of the recent introduction of velcade and the current lack of competitive product available 
we recognize co promotion revenue based on sgp s reported shipments of integrilin eptifibatide injection to wholesalers 
co promotion revenue includes our share of the profits from the sales of integrilin  reimbursements of our manufacturing related costs  development costs  advertising and promotional expenses and royalties from sgp on sales of integrilin outside of the co promotion territory 
we communicate with sgp to calculate our share of the profits from the sales of integrilin on a monthly basis 
the calculation includes estimates of the amount of advertising and promotional expenses and other costs incurred on a monthly basis 
we also communicate with sgp to estimate royalties earned on sales outside of the co promotion territory 
adjustments to our estimates are based upon actual information that we receive subsequent to our reporting deadlines 
our estimates are adjusted on a monthly basis and historically have not been significant due to periodic communication with sgp 
significant adjustments in future reporting periods could impact the timing and the amount of revenue to be recognized 
we recognize nonrefundable upfront licensing fees and guaranteed  time based payments that require continuing involvement in the form of research and development  manufacturing or other commercialization efforts by us as strategic alliance revenue ratably over the development period if development risk is significant  ratably over the manufacturing period or estimated product useful life if development risk has been substantially eliminated  or based upon the level of research services performed during the period of the research contract 
when the period of deferral cannot be specifically identified from the contract  management estimates the period based upon other critical factors contained within the contract 
we continually review these estimates which could result in a change in the deferral period and might impact the timing and the amount of revenue recognized 
milestone payments are recognized as strategic alliance revenue when the performance obligations  as defined in the contract  are achieved 
performance obligations typically consist of significant milestones in the development life cycle of the related technology  such as initiation of clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies and approvals by regulatory agencies 
royalties are recognized as revenue when earned 
reimbursements of research and development costs are recognized as strategic alliance revenue as the related costs are incurred 
inventory inventory consists of currently marketed products and from time to time product candidates awaiting regulatory approval which were capitalized based upon management s judgment of probable near term commercialization 
we assess the probability of commercialization based upon several factors including estimated launch date  time to manufacture and shelf life 
at december  and  inventory does not include amounts for products that have not been approved for sale 
inventory primarily represents raw materials used in production  work in process and finished goods inventory on hand  valued at cost 
inventories are reviewed periodically for slow moving or obsolete status based on sales activity  both projected and historical 
our current sales projections provide for full utilization of the inventory balance 
if product sales levels differ from projections or a launch of a new product is delayed  inventory may not be fully utilized and could be subject to impairment  at which point we would record a reserve to adjust inventory to its net realizable value 
intangible assets we have acquired significant intangible assets that we value and record 
those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in process research and development  and those that are specifically identified and have alternative future uses are capitalized 
we use a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk  the cost of capital  and terminal values 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
we engage independent valuation experts who review our critical assumptions for significant acquisitions of intangibles 
we review intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis using an undiscounted net cash flows approach 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  the intangible asset is written down to the discounted cash flow value 
where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
goodwill on october   we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and determined that no impairment existed on that date 
however  since the date of acquisition of cor  which generated a significant amount of goodwill  we have experienced a significant decline in market capitalization due to a decline in stock price 
we continually monitor business and market conditions to assess whether an impairment indicator exists 
if we were to determine that an impairment indicator exists  we would be required to perform an impairment test which could result in a material impairment charge to our statement of operations 
accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 or fin  and in december issued a revised fin  or fin r  which addressed the period of adoption of fin for entities created before january  fin provides a new consolidation model which determines control and consolidation based on potential variability in gains and losses 
the provisions of fin are effective for enterprises with variable interests in variable interest entities created after january  we adopted the provisions of fin in the first quarter of fiscal and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations for our interests in variable interest entities created before february  in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments created or modified after may   and otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires companies to calculate and record in the income statement the cost of equity instruments  such as stock options or restricted stock  awarded to employees for services received 
the cost of the equity instrument is to be measured based on the fair value of the instruments on the date they are granted and is required to be recognized over the period during which the employees are required to provide services in exchange for the equity instruments 
sfas no 
r is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  sfas no 
r provides two alternatives for adoption a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the effective date of the statement as well as for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which follows the approach in the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate prior periods to record compensation cost calculated under sfas no 
for pro forma disclosure 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we cannot accurately estimate at this time the impact of adopting sfas no 
r as it will depend on our market price  our assumptions used and levels of share based payments granted in future periods 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in a prior period  the impact would approximate the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
reclassifications in connection with the launch of velcade bortezomib for injection in may and the recognition of the related costs of sales  we reclassified some integrilin eptifibatide injection related manufacturing expenses to cost of goods sold so that cost of goods sold now includes manufacturing related expenses associated with the sales of integrilin and velcade 
these reclassified manufacturing related expenses were previously included in cost of co promotion revenue and some integrilin related advertising and promotional expenses that were previously included in cost of co promotion revenue have been reclassified to selling  general and administrative expenses 
prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation 
there was no impact on net loss in any period 
results of operations year ended december  annual percentage change in thousands  except per share amounts revenues net product sales   co promotion revenue    revenue under strategic alliances    total revenues    costs and expenses cost of sales excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets research and development    selling  general and administrative    restructuring     acquired in process research and development  amortization of intangibles    total costs and expenses    loss from operations    other income expense investment income  net    interest expense    gain on sale of equity interest in joint venture   debt financing charge   net loss    amounts per common share net loss per share  basic and diluted weighted average shares  basic and diluted   revenues total revenues increased to million in and to million in increases in both years were driven by product related revenue 
in may we received fda approval to market velcade bortezomib for injection and began shipping to wholesalers 
net product sales of velcade were million in and million in  reflecting increased patient penetration and use of the product 
reserves for product returns  chargebacks and discounts represent approximately to of gross product sales in and product sales from velcade represent approximately of our total revenues and of our total revenues 
co promotion revenue  based upon worldwide sales of integrilin eptifibatide injection  increased to million in and to million in these increases are due to higher net reimbursement from sgp under our collaboration agreement and increased product sales in the united states 
us product sales  as provided to us by sgp  were million  a increase over sales in co promotion revenue represents approximately of our total revenues and of our total revenues 
revenue under strategic alliances decreased to million in and to million in the decrease in is primarily due to the april termination of the aventis technology transfer agreement and reduced revenue recognized under the research phase of the bayer agreement  offset by increased revenue under our ortho biotech alliance from milestone payments earned relating to velcade bortezomib for injection approval in the european union and the achievement of specified sales levels of velcade 
the decrease in primarily relates to less revenue recognized under our research alliance with monsanto company  which expired in at the end of its original five year term and the conclusion of the research phase of our bayer alliance in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by clinical milestones earned under our ortho biotech alliance and million of revenue recognized in connection with the termination of the aventis technology transfer agreement there were no amounts of revenue recognized in that were included in the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle relating to the adoption of sab in included in strategic alliance revenue in is million that was recognized in prior years relating to the adoption of sab included in strategic alliance revenue in is million that was recognized in prior years relating to the adoption of sab we expect revenue under strategic alliances to fluctuate depending on the level of revenues earned for ongoing development efforts  the level of milestones achieved and the number of sales and marketing alliances we may enter into in the future with major pharmaceutical companies 
cost of sales cost of sales increased to million in and to million in cost of sales includes manufacturing related expenses associated with the sales of velcade and integrilin eptifibatide injection 
the increases were primarily driven by increased sales of velcade and integrilin 
research and development research and development expenses decreased to million in and to million in the decreases reflect the financial benefits of our june restructuring efforts  including reductions in discovery personnel and personnel related costs  including facilities expenses and lower development costs for velcade in the decreases are partially offset by increases in clinical trial costs for mln and integrilin in and velcade in in addition to our ongoing clinical trials of integrilin eptifibatide injection and velcade bortezomib for injection  we have eight drug candidates in late preclinical and clinical development 
the following chart summarizes the applicable disease indication and the clinical or preclinical trial status of these eight drug candidates 
product description disease indication current trial status cancer mln is a targeting monoclonal antibody vehicle conjugated to toxin dm prostate cancer phase i phase ii mln is a small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase  or rtk  that inhibits the ft kinase acute myeloid leukemia phase i phase ii mln is a small molecule inhibitor of aurora kinases solid tumor cancers preclinical cardiovascular diseases mln is a recombinant protein that is designed to block complement at both the c and c convertases reperfusion injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgeries phase i inflammatory diseases mln is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against ccr rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis phase ii preclinical with phase iia planned secondary atherosclerosis preclinical with phase iia planned scleroderma preclinical with phase iia planned mln is a small molecule ccr inhibitor chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis phase i mln is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the greek alpha receptor crohn s disease ulcerative colitis preclinical with prior phase ii data preclinical with prior phase ii data mlnis a small molecule ccr inhibitor backup to mln chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis preclinical completion of clinical trials may take several years or more and the length of time can vary substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
the types of costs incurred during a clinical trial vary depending upon the type of product candidate and the nature of the study 
we estimate that clinical trials in our areas of focus are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase objective estimated completion period phase i establish safety in humans  study how the drug works  metabolizes and interacts with other drugs years phase ii evaluate efficacy  optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety years phase iii confirm efficacy and safety of the product years upon successful completion of phase iii clinical trials of a product candidate  we intend to submit the results to the fda to support regulatory approval 
however  we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will prove to be safe or effective  will receive regulatory approvals  or will be successfully commercialized 
our clinical trials might prove that our product candidates may not be effective in treating the disease or have undesirable or unintended side effects  toxicities or other characteristics that require us to cease further development of the product candidate 
the cost to take a product candidate through clinical trials is dependent upon  among other things  the disease indications  the timing  the size and dosing schedule of each clinical trial  the number of patients enrolled in each trial and the speed at which patients are enrolled and treated 
we could incur increased product development costs if we experience delays in clinical trial enrollment  delays in the evaluation of clinical trial results or delays in regulatory approvals 
some products that are likely to result from our research and development projects are based on new technologies and new therapeutic approaches that have not been extensively tested in humans 
the regulatory requirements governing these types of products may be more rigorous than for conventional products 
as a result  it is difficult to estimate the nature and length of the efforts to complete such products as we may experience a longer regulatory process in connection with any products that we develop based upon these new technologies or therapeutic approaches 
in addition  ultimate approval for commercial manufacturing and marketing of our products is dependent on the fda or applicable approval body in the country for which approval is being sought  adding further uncertainty to estimated costs and completion dates 
significant delays could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates 
due to the variability in the length of time necessary to develop a product  the uncertainties related to the estimated cost of the projects and ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
we budget and monitor our research and development costs by type or category  rather than by project on a comprehensive or fully allocated basis 
significant categories of costs include personnel  clinical  third party research and development services and laboratory supplies 
in addition  a significant portion of our research and development expenses is not tracked by project as it benefits multiple projects or our technology platform 
consequently  fully loaded research and development cost summaries by project are not available 
given the uncertainties related to development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our product candidates will generate revenue and cash flows 
we do not expect to receive net cash inflows from any of our major research and development projects until a product candidate becomes a profitable commercial product 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in and to million in the increase in is due to increased commercial spend to support velcade bortezomib for injection and integrilin eptifibatide injection reflecting a full year of increased headcount and activities by the velcade and expanded integrilin sales forces partially offset by decreased expenses in corporate general and administrative functions attributable to our restructuring and cost containment efforts 
the increase in reflects the net impact of increased selling and marketing expenses related to the launch of velcade and the expansion of the millennium sgp sales force for integrilin offset by decreased consulting and legal expenses 
restructuring in december and june  we took steps to focus our resources on drug development and commercialization 
our restructuring plan included consolidation of research and development facilities  overall headcount reduction and streamlining of discovery and development projects 
we recorded restructuring charges of million in primarily related to the recognition of the estimated remaining rental obligations  net of estimated sublease income  for facilities we vacated during we recorded restructuring charges of million in related to asset impairments  remaining rental obligations on facilities we have vacated  personnel costs and contract termination 
our decisions to vacate specified facilities and abandon the related leasehold improvements as well as terminate specified research programs were deemed to be impairment indicators under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas no 
as a result of performing the impairment evaluations  we recorded asset impairment charges to adjust the carrying value of the related long lived assets to fair value 
fair value of the assets was estimated based upon anticipated future cash flows  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
we anticipate additional restructuring charges during of between approximately million and million relating to adjustments to the estimates of the remaining rental obligations  net of estimated sublease income  for facilities we vacated 
acquired in process research and development we recorded a one time  non cash charge to operations in of million for acquired in process research and development from the cor acquisition 
the valuation of acquired in process research and development represents the estimated fair value related to incomplete projects that  at the time of the cor acquisition  had no alternative future use and for which technological feasibility had not been established 
the in process technology we acquired from cor consisted of five significant research and development projects for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases  as well as in the area of oncology 
during  we discontinued four of the five programs as part of our streamlining of discovery and development projects 
we have advanced the remaining program into phase i clinical testing 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangible assets decreased to million in and increased to million in amortization decreased in as the specifically identified intangible assets from our leukosite  inc  or leukosite  acquisition were fully amortized as of december amortization in relates to specifically identified intangible assets from the cor acquisition  as well as our acquisitions of leukosite in and cambridge discovery chemistry ltd  or cdc  in we will continue to amortize the specifically identified intangible assets from our cor acquisition through we expect to incur amortization expense of approximately million for each of the next five years 
investment income investment income decreased to million in and to million in the decrease in is a result of a lower average balance of invested funds  as well as increased realized losses on marketable securities and other investments 
the decrease in is primarily attributable to a lower average balance of invested funds and less favorable market conditions resulting in lower yields  coupled with a decrease in realized gains  as significant realized gains were recognized from our investment portfolio in interest expense interest expense decreased to million in and to million in the decreases are attributable to the april repurchase of million aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due march   that are convertible into our common stock at any time prior to maturity at a price equal to per share the notes and our convertible senior notes due june   that are convertible into our common stock at any time prior to maturity at a price equal to per share the notes 
gain on sale of equity interest in joint venture through our acquisition of leukosite  we became a party to a joint venture partnership  millennium and ilex partners  lp  or m i  for development of campath alemtuzumab humanized monoclonal antibody 
we sold our equity interest in m i and in consideration for the sale  we received an initial payment of million in december during each of the second quarters of and  we recorded additional gains of million on our sale of this equity interest based upon the achievement of predetermined sales targets of campath 
during the first quarter of  we recorded the final million gain related to our sale of this equity interest based upon the achievement of predetermined sales targets of campath 
in addition  we will be entitled to additional payments from ilex if sales of campath in the united states after exceed specified annual thresholds 
we do not expect that these thresholds will be achieved and therefore  we are unlikely to receive any future additional payments related to campath 
debt financing charge during  we recorded a non cash charge of million which represents the write off of approximately million of unamortized original debt issuance costs associated with the notes and notes assumed in the cor acquisition  offset by million relating to the expired put premium on the untendered notes on april  during  we recorded a non cash charge of million relating to the fair value of the put premium placed on the notes and notes 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operating expenses  to make capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments and to pay debt service  including principal and interest and capital lease payments 
we have also made strategic commitments to purchase debt and equity securities from some of our alliance collaborators in accordance with our board of directors approved policies and our business needs 
these investment commitments are generally in smaller companies 
we have and may in the future lose money in these investments and our ability to liquidate these investments is in some cases very limited 
we may also owe our partners milestone payments and royalties 
we also have committed to fund development costs incurred by some of our collaborators 
we have funded our cash requirements primarily through the following our co promotion relationship with sgp for the sale of integrilin eptifibatide injection  sales of velcade bortezomib for injection  payments from our strategic collaborators  including equity investments  license fees  milestone payments and research funding  and equity and debt financings in the public markets 
in the future  we expect to continue to fund our cash requirements from some of these sources as well as from sales of other products  subject to receiving regulatory approval 
we are entitled to additional committed research and development funding under some of our strategic alliances 
we believe the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash are revenues and margins from sales of velcade  integrilin and other products and services for which we may obtain marketing approval in the future or which are sold by companies that may owe us royalty  milestone  distribution or other payments on account of such products  the success of our clinical and preclinical development programs  our ability to enter into additional strategic collaborations and to maintain existing and new collaborations as well as the success of such collaborations  and the receptivity of the capital markets to financings by biopharmaceutical companies generally and to financings by our company specifically
