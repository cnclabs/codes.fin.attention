the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  whic h have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires th e company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingen t assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to the carrying value of inventories  realizability of outstanding accounts receivable  percentage of completion of long term contracts  and the provision for income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form th e basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from the company s estimates 
however  results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amount s reported in its consolidated financial statements accounts receivable accounts receivable on a consolidated basis consist principally of amount s due from both domestic and foreign customers 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition and collateral is not generall y required except at lynch systems where collateral generally consists of letters of credit on large machine and international purchases 
the company considers concentrations of credit risk to be minimal due to the company s diverse customer base 
in relation to export sales  the company requires letters of credit supporting a significant portion of the sales price prior to production to limit exposure to credit risk 
certain subsidiaries and business segments have credit sales to industries that are subject to cyclical economic changes 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts at a level that management believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
w e base our estimates on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and relationship of our accounts receivable and revenues 
in determining these estimates  we examine historical write offs of our receivable s and review each client s account to identify any specific customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
our failure to estimate accurately the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and result s of operations 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
inventories valued using the last in first out lifo method comprised approximately an d of consolidated inventories at december  and  respectively 
th e decline is due to the fact that pti  acquired effective september   values its inventory at first in first out fifo 
the balance of inventories a t december  and are valued using the first in first out fifo method 
if actual market conditions are more or less favorable than those projected by management  adjustments may be required 
revenue recognition and accounting for long term contracts revenues  with the exception of certain long term contracts discussed below  are recognized upon shipment when title passes 
shipping costs are included in manufacturing cost of sales 
lynch systems is engaged in the manufacture and marketing of glass formin g machines and specialized manufacturing machines 
certain sales contracts requir e an advance payment usually of the contract price  which is accounted for as a customer advance 
the contractual sales prices are paid either i as the manufacturing process reaches specified levels of completion or ii based on the shipment date 
guarantees by letter of credit from a qualifying financial institution are required for most sales contracts 
because of the specialized nature of these machines and the period of time needed to complete production and shipping  lynch systems accounts for these contracts using the percentage of completion accounting method as costs are incurred compared to total estimated project costs cost to cost basis 
at december  and  unbilled accounts receivable included in accounts receivable were million and million  respectively 
the percentage of completion method is used since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made  based on historical experience and milestones set in the contract 
financial management maintains contact with project managers to discuss the status of the projects and  for fixed price engagements  financial management i s updated on the budgeted costs and required resources to complete the project 
these budgets are then used to calculate revenue recognition and to estimate th e anticipated income or loss on the project 
in the past  we have occasionally been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects which have resulted in lower than anticipated profitability or losses on those contracts 
we may experience similar situations in the future 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts are made during the period in which such losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
to date  such losses have not been significant 
warranty expense lynch systems provides a full warranty to worldwide customers who acquire machines 
the warranty covers both parts and labor and normally covers a period of one year or thirteen months 
based upon historical experience  the company provides for estimated warranty costs based upon three to five percent of the selling price of the machine 
the company periodically assesses the adequacy of the reserve and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
in thousands balance  beginning of the year warranties issued during the year settlements made during the year changes in liabilities for pre existing warranties during the year  including expirations balance  end of the year income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is recorded for deferred tax assets whose realization is not likely 
as of december  an d december   a valuation allowance of  and  respectively  was recorded 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax asset at december of  is equal to the amount of the company s carry forward alternative minimum tax amt at that date 
earnings per share and stock based compensation the company s basic and diluted earnings per share are equivalent  as the company has no dilutive securities 
at december   the company has a stock based employee compensation plan  which is described in note to the consolidated financial statements stock options plans 
the company accounts for the plan under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
the company provides pro forma disclosures of the compensation expense determined under the fair value provisions of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
see notes and to the consolidate d financial statements 
recent issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires companies to measure compensation costs for share based payments to employees  including stock options  at fair value and expense such compensation over the service period beginning with the first interim or annual period after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
the company is required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of fiscal under sfas r  companies must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuin g share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods includ e prospective and retroactive adoption options 
management is evaluating the requirements of sfas r 
since the company currently has no unvested stock options outstanding  management believes the impact of adopting sfas r will have no effect on the company s financial results for item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk relating to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the amounts of interest earned on the company s cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash approximately million at december  
the company generally finances the debt portion of the acquisition of long term assets with fixed rate  long term debt 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
management does not foresee any significan t changes in the strategies used to manage interest rate risk in the near future  although the strategies may be reevaluated as market conditions dictate 
there has been no significant change in market risk since december  since the company s international sales are in us dollars  there is no monetary risk 
at december   approximately million of the company s debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s earnings and cash flows are slightly affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings for variable rate debt  and assuming a two percentage point increase in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that the company s interest expense would change by approximately tha n million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management would take actions to further mitigate its exposure
