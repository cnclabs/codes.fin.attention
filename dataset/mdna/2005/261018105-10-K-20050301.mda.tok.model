a key contributor to the increase between years was a lower effective tax rate  due to a million reduction in current year federal income tax expense associated with the settlement of prior year tax returns 
pre tax income was little changed between years  up million  primarily reflecting a million or increase in net interest income due to growth in average interest earning assets  a million improvement in loan servicing activities  a million increase in loan and deposit related fees  and a million increase in income from real estate and joint ventures held for investment due to higher gains from sales 
those favorable pre tax items were partially offset by a million or increase in general and administrative expense  a million decline in net gains on sales of loans and mortgage backed securities due primarily to a lower gain per dollar of loan sold  a million unfavorable change in our provision for loan losses primarily reflecting growth in our loan portfolio  a million unfavorable change associated with securities gains losses  virtually all of which related to a partial economic hedge against value changes of mortgage servicing rights msrs  and a million loss on extinguishment of debt  which represented the recognition in of deferred issuance costs associated with the redemption of million of junior subordinated debentures prior to their maturity and redemption of the related capital securities 
this debt was replaced with lower cost senior debt of approximately million more than the amount required to repay the debentures 
for  our return on average assets was and our return on average equity was 
these compare to our returns of on average assets and on average equity 
our loan originations  including purchases  increased from billion in to a record billion in  of which billion were originated for sale in the secondary market 
of the total  billion represented originations of single family loans for portfolio  of which million were subprime credits 
in addition to single family loans  we originated million of other loans during the year  including million of home equity lines of credit 
page 
navigation links our assets increased billion or during to billion at year end  following a decline during the increase was primarily in loans held for investment  as originations outpaced payoffs and the fourth quarter sale of approximately billion of our single family loans on a servicing released basis 
the loans sold were seasoned adjustable rate mortgages tied to the month moving average of annual yields on actively traded us treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year mta 
prior to the end of the first quarter of  we expect to replace the mta loans sold and to meet our previously stated objective of managing balance sheet growth in line with the growth of retained earnings 
we expect to replace these mta loans with higher yielding loans to achieve a breakeven point for lost interest income in the second quarter of when considering the fourth quarter gain from this loan sale 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  we sold approximately of our msrs on loans we service for others 
those sales are expected to reduce our earnings volatility  since the amount of msrs we now own is significantly lower 
given that reduced volatility  we also sold securities that we had purchased as a partial economic hedge against future value changes in our msrs 
deposits increased billion or during to a year end level of billion  following a decline during borrowings increased billion or to a year end level of billion  following a increase in in june  we issued million year senior notes 
on july   we used a portion of the net proceeds from the senior notes to redeem  in whole  our junior subordinated debentures before maturity at a price of of principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and contemporaneously redeemed all the outstanding capital securities and common securities issued by downey financial capital trust i  a wholly owned special purpose entity 
in connection with our redemption of the capital securities  we incurred in the current year a pre tax charge of million 
this charge represented the recognition of the remaining unamortized issuance cost for the capital securities 
that charge  however  will be offset within a year due to the lower interest rate being paid on the funds that were used to redeem the capital securities 
the remaining net proceeds from the senior notes as well as other cash at the holding company was used during the year to make a million equity contribution into downey savings and loan association  fa the bank to support our asset growth 
non performing assets totaled million at december   down from million a year ago 
the decrease was due primarily to a decline in our residential non performers 
when measured as a percentage of total assets  our non performing assets dropped to at year end from at year end at december   the bank exceeded all regulatory capital tests  with capital to asset ratios of for both tangible and core capital and for risk based capital 
these capital levels are significantly above the well capitalized standards defined by the federal banking regulators of for core and tangible capital and for risk based capital

our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page certain accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions which could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and we consider these to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
page 
navigation links we believe the following are critical accounting policies that require the most significant estimates and assumptions  which are particularly susceptible to significant change in the preparation of our financial statements the valuation of expected interest rate lock commitments 
we enter into commitments to make loans that we intend to sell to investors whereby the interest rate on the loan is set prior to funding 
these interest rate lock commitments are considered to be derivatives and are recorded at fair value 
this value is calculated using market sources  adjusted by an anticipated fallout factor for interest rate lock commitments that are not expected to fund 
at december   an asset was recorded for interest rate lock derivatives of million  compared to the prior year end asset balance of million 
for further information  see interest rate lock derivatives on page and note on page and note on page of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for losses on loans and real estate 
the allowance for losses on loans and real estate are maintained at an amount management deems adequate to cover inherent losses in the portfolios 
we use an internal asset review system and loan loss allowance methodology designed to provide for the detection of problem assets and an adequate allowance to cover loan losses 
in determining the allowance for loan losses related to loans over million  we evaluate the loans on an individual basis  including an analysis of the creditworthiness  cash flows and financial status of the borrower  and the condition and the estimated value of the collateral 
generally  we review all loans under million by analyzing their performance and the composition of their collateral as a whole because of the relatively homogeneous nature of the loans  unless an individual loan or borrower relationship warrants separate analysis 
this allowance is determined by applying against asset balances the associated factors for each major asset type that consider past loss experience and asset duration or loss statistics against current classified asset balances 
at december   the allowance totaled million  compared to the prior year end allowances of million 
for further information  see allowance for losses on loans and real estate on page and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements on page the valuation of msrs 
the fair value of msrs is measured using a discounted cash flow analysis based on available market quotes  market adjusted discount rates and anticipated prepayment speeds 
market sources are used to determine prepayment speeds  the net cost of servicing per loan  inflation rate  and default and interest rates for mortgages 
msrs are reviewed for impairment based on their fair value 
we capitalize and measure msr impairment on a disaggregated basis based on predominant risk characteristics of the underlying mortgage loans  which include fixed rate mortgage loans by loan term and coupon rate less than  basis point increments between and  and greater than and adjustable rate mortgages by loan term 
impairment losses are recognized through a valuation allowance for each impaired stratum  with any associated provision recorded as a component of loan servicing income loss 
at december   the msr valuation allowance totaled million  compared to the prior year end allowance of million 
for further information  see note on page and note on page of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the prepayment reserves related to sales of loans and of msrs 
the gains on sales of loans and of msrs are recorded net of reserves for anticipated prepayments 
these sales contracts typically contain provisions to refund sale price premiums to the purchaser if the related loans prepay during a period not to exceed days from the sale s date 
loan and msr sales reserves are estimated using the prepayment experience of similar products 
the estimates are updated during the day period for actual payoffs 
at december   the reserves were million  compared to reserves of less than million at december  for further information  see secondary marketing activities on page  note on page and note on page of notes to the consolidated financial statements

navigation links results of operations net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
the spread between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities and the relative dollar amounts of these assets and liabilities principally affects net interest income 
our net interest income totaled million in  up million or from and million or from the improvement during reflected higher average interest earning assets which increased by billion or to billion 
our effective interest rate spread averaged in  down from in and in the decline in was due to our yield on interest earning assets declining more rapidly than our cost of funds 
although the market indices to which our adjustable rate loans are tied began to rise in mid  on average they were lower in than lower indices along with our positive interest rate gap ie  more interest earning assets reprice to market interest rates within one year than do interest bearing liabilities were the primary contributors to our more rapid decline in our yield on interest earning assets 
in addition  the decline in our effective interest rate spread also reflected a higher proportion of lower yielding adjustable rate mortgages tied to mta that had lower fully indexed yields than those tied to the fhlb eleventh district cost of funds index cofi and a lower percentage of higher yielding subprime loans 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold approximately billion of mta loans 
while the sale temporarily results in assets growing more slowly than growth in retained earnings  we expect asset growth to be more in line with the growth in retained earnings and we expect to replace the mta loans that were sold by the end of the first quarter of initially  the sale will reduce net interest income until the loans are replaced 
however  it is expected a breakeven point for the lost net interest income will occur by mid year  when considering the gain from this sale 
after mid  overall profits should be enhanced from the higher yielding loans 
the following table presents for the years indicated the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  and interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities and the resultant costs  expressed as rates 
the table also sets forth our net interest income  interest rate spread and effective interest rate spread 
the effective interest rate spread reflects the relative level of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities and equals the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  divided by average interest earning assets for the year 
the table also sets forth our net interest earning balance the difference between the average balance of interest earning assets and the average balance of total deposits and borrowings for the years indicated 
we included non accrual loans in the average interest earning assets balance

most of our loan servicing agreements require us to pay interest to the investor for an entire month  even if the loan we service for others prepays prior to the end of a month 
that additional interest cost is what we call payoff and curtailment interest cost 
however  we benefit from the use of those proceeds from the time of repayment until we are required to remit the funds to the investor 
that benefit results in an increase to our net interest income 
in each of the three years  the fair value of our msrs declined due to the drop in long term interest rates that resulted in an increase in the actual and projected rate loans we service for others prepay  thereby shortening their expected average life 
those declines in the fair value required us to record a provision for impairment in each year

page 
navigation links asset liability management and market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk in our lending and deposit taking activities 
interest rate risk primarily occurs to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature on a different basis than our interest earning assets 
since our earnings depend primarily on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  our principal objectives are to actively monitor and manage the effects of adverse changes in interest rates on net interest income 
our primary strategy to manage interest rate risk is to emphasize the origination for investment of adjustable rate mortgages or loans with relatively short maturities 
interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages are primarily tied to cofi  mta  libor and cmt 
we also may execute swap contracts to change interest rate characteristics of our interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities to better manage interest rate risk 
in addition to the interest rate risk associated with our lending for investment and deposit taking activities  we also have market risk associated with our secondary marketing activities 
changes in mortgage interest rates  primarily fixed rate mortgages  impact the fair value of loans held for sale as well as our interest rate lock commitment derivatives  where we have committed to an interest rate with a potential borrower for a loan we intend to sell 
our objective is to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates through use of forward sale and purchase contracts with government sponsored enterprises and whole loan sale contracts with various parties 
these contracts are typically obtained at the time the interest rate lock commitments are made 
therefore  as interest rates fluctuate  the changes in the fair value of our interest rate lock commitments and loans held for sale tend to be offset by changes in the fair value of the hedge contracts 
we continue to hedge as previously done before the issuance of sfas as applied to our risk management strategies  sfas may increase or decrease reported net income and stockholders equity  depending on interest rates and other variables affecting the fair values of derivative instruments and hedged items  but will have no effect on the overall economics of the transactions 
the method used for assessing the effectiveness of a hedging derivative  as well as the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspects of the hedge  is established at the inception of the hedge 
we generally do not enter into hedging contracts for speculative purposes 
changes in mortgage interest rates also impact the value of our msrs 
rising interest rates typically result in slower prepayment speeds on the loans being serviced for others which increase the value of msrs 
declining interest rates typically result in faster prepayment speeds which decrease the value of msrs 
during the first quarter of  we implemented a fairly simple hedging strategy by purchasing securities classified as available for sale as a partial economic hedge against future value changes in our msrs 
during periods when long term interest rates decline  the value of our msrs will fall and the resultant msr valuation addition will  in general  be partially offset by securities gains 
however  if long term interest rates rise causing msr values to improve  the securities will be in a loss position and may be sold with the intention to reset the hedge at a higher market interest rate 
any realized loss from the securities sales will be mitigated by the favorable earnings impact associated with the recapture of any existing msr valuation allowance 
while this strategy is not constructed to be a perfect hedge  it is expected to reduce earnings volatility from changing msr values 
over time  we may use derivatives in lieu of securities  or a combination of both  to provide an economic hedge against value changes in our msrs 
in addition  the dollar amount used as an economic hedge may vary as we reset the hedge due to changes in the volume of msrs or their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates 
in connection with the sale of approximately of our msrs during the fourth quarter of which thereby reduced the risk of changing msr values  the partial economic hedge established in the first quarter of was closed in october our asset liability management committee is responsible for implementing the interest rate risk management policy which sets forth limits established by the board of directors of acceptable changes in net interest income and net portfolio value from specified changes in interest rates 
the ots defines net portfolio value as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of expected cash flows from existing off balance sheet contracts 
our asset liability management committee reviews  among other items  economic conditions  the interest rate outlook  the demand for loans  the availability of deposits and borrowings  and our current operating results  liquidity  capital and interest rate exposure 
in addition  our asset liability management committee monitors asset and liability maturities and repricing characteristics on a regular basis and performs various simulations and other analyses to determine the potential impact of various business strategies in controlling interest rate risk and the potential impact of those strategies upon future earnings under various interest rate scenarios 
based on these reviews  our asset liability management committee formulates a strategy that is intended to implement the objectives set forth in our business plan without exceeding the net interest income and net portfolio value limits set forth in our interest rate risk policy 
page 
navigation links one measure of our exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is shown in the following table which sets forth the repricing frequency of our major asset and liability categories as of december   as well as other information regarding the repricing and maturity differences between our interest earning assets and the total of deposits and borrowings in future periods 
we refer to these differences as gap 
we have determined the repricing frequencies by reference to projected maturities  based upon contractual maturities as adjusted for scheduled repayments and repricing mechanisms provisions for changes in the interest and dividend rates of assets and liabilities 
we assume prepayment rates on substantially all of our loan portfolio based upon our historical loan prepayment experience and anticipated future prepayments 
repricing mechanisms on a number of our assets are subject to limitations  such as caps on the amount that interest rates and payments on our loans may adjust  and accordingly  these assets do not normally respond to changes in market interest rates as completely or rapidly as our liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if we used different assumptions or if actual experience differed from the assumptions set forth

navigation links our six month gap at december  was a positive 
this means that more interest earning assets mature or reprice within six months than the total of deposits and borrowings 
this is up from a positive six month gap of at december  and at december  we originated and purchased for investment loans and mortgage backed securities with adjustable interest rates or maturities of five years or less of approximately billion during  billion during and billion during these loans represented essentially all loans and mortgage backed securities originated and purchased for investment during  and at december   and  essentially all of our interest earning assets mature  reprice or are estimated to prepay within five years 
at december   billion or of our loans held for investment and mortgage backed securities portfolios consisted of adjustable rate loans and loans with a due date of five years or less  compared to billion or at december  and billion or at december  during  we will continue to offer residential fixed rate loan products to our customers to meet customer demand 
we primarily originate fixed rate loans for sale in the secondary market and price them accordingly to create loan servicing income and to increase opportunities for originating adjustable rate mortgages 
however  we may originate fixed rate loans for investment when funded with long term funds to mitigate interest rate risk and small volumes to facilitate the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure or that meet required yield and other approved guidelines 
for further information  see secondary marketing and loan servicing activities on page we are better protected against rising interest rates with a positive six month gap 
however  we remain subject to possible interest rate spread compression  which would adversely impact our net interest income if interest rates rise 
this is primarily due to the lag in repricing of the indices to which our adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities are tied  as well as the repricing frequencies and periodic interest rate caps on these adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities 
the amount of such interest rate spread compression would depend upon the frequency and severity of such interest rate fluctuations 
in addition to measuring interest rate risk via a gap analysis  we establish limits on  and measure the sensitivity of  our net interest income and net portfolio value to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous and sustained movements in interest rates in basis point increments 
we utilize an internally maintained asset liability management simulation model to make the calculations which  for net portfolio value  are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
first  we estimate our net interest income for the next twelve months and the current net portfolio value assuming no change in interest rates from those at period end 
once the base case has been estimated  we make calculations for each of the defined changes in interest rates  to include any associated differences in the anticipated prepayment speed of loans 
we then compare those results against the base case to determine the estimated change to net interest income and net portfolio value due to the changes in interest rates 
the following are the estimated impacts to net interest income and net portfolio value from various instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rates based upon our asset and liability structure as of year ends and since we base these estimates upon numerous assumptions  like the expected maturities of our interest bearing assets and liabilities and the shape of the period end interest rate yield curve  our actual sensitivity to interest rate changes could vary significantly if actual experience differs from those assumptions used in making the calculations

navigation links the following table shows our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair values at december  this data differs from that in the gap table as it does not incorporate the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
rather  it only reflects contractual maturities adjusted for anticipated prepayments and call provisions for investment securities 
market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as on and off balance sheet derivatives and other financial instruments 
our assets and liabilities that do not have a stated maturity date  such as certain deposits  are considered to be long term in nature and are reported in the thereafter column 
we do not consider these financial instruments to be materially sensitive to interest rate fluctuations  and historically  the balances have remained fairly constant over various economic conditions 
the weighted average interest rates for the various fixed rate and variable rate assets and liabilities presented are based on the actual rates that existed at december  the fair value of our financial instruments is determined as follows fed funds and fhlb stock equal their book values due to their short term repricing characteristics 
investment securities and mortgage backed securities are based on the closing market price quotations from financial market monitoring firms 
loans held for sale are based on bid quotations from financial market monitoring firms 
loans held for investment takes into consideration discounted cash flows through the estimated maturity or repricing dates using estimated market discount rates 
demand deposits  money market and savings accounts are equal to their book values 
time deposits and borrowings are based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows  which is estimated using wholesale borrowing rates offered for similar terms 
senior notes are based on bid prices published in financial newspapers  or bid quotations received from securities dealers or readily available market quote systems 
the degree of market risk inherent in loans with prepayment features may not be completely reflected in the disclosures 
although we have taken into consideration our historical prepayment trends adjusted for current market conditions to determine expected maturity categories  prepayment features are triggered by changes in the market rates of interest 
unexpected changes may increase the rate of prepayments above those anticipated 
as such  the potential loss from such market rate changes may be significantly larger

it is our policy to take appropriate  timely and aggressive action when necessary to resolve non performing assets 
when resolving problem loans  it is our policy to determine collectibility under various circumstances which are intended to result in our maximum financial benefit 
we accomplish this by either working with the borrower to bring the loan current or by foreclosing and selling the asset 
we perform ongoing reviews of loans that display weaknesses and maintain adequate loss allowances for them 
for a discussion on our internal asset review policy  refer to allowance for losses on loans and real estate on page at december   million of our non performing assets were located outside of california  compared to million outside of california a year ago 
we evaluate the need for appraisals of non performing assets on a periodic basis 
we will generally obtain a new appraisal when we believe that there may have been an adverse change in the property operations or in the economic conditions of the geographic market of the property securing our loans 
our policy is to obtain new appraisals at least annually for all real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
non accrual loans it is our general policy to account for a loan as non accrual when the loan becomes days delinquent or when collection of interest appears doubtful 
in a number of cases  loans may remain on accrual status past days when we determine that continued accrual is warranted because the loan is well secured and in process of collection 
as of december   we had no loans days or more delinquent which remained on accrual status 
we reverse and charge against interest income any interest previously accrued with respect to non accrual loans 
we recognize interest income on non accrual loans to the extent that we receive payments and to the extent that we believe we will recover the remaining principal balance of the loan 
we restore these loans to an accrual status only if all past due payments are made by the borrower and the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest 
at december   non accrual loans aggregating million were less than days delinquent relative to their contractual terms 
troubled debt restructurings we consider a restructuring of a debt a troubled debt restructuring when we  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise grant 
troubled debt restructurings may include changing repayment terms  reducing the stated interest rate or reducing the amounts of principal and or interest due or extending the maturity date 
the restructuring of a loan is intended to recover as much of our investment as possible and to achieve the highest yield possible

navigation links delinquent loans when a borrower fails to make required payments on a loan and does not cure the delinquency within days  we normally record a notice of default to commence foreclosure proceedings  so long as we have given any required prior notice to the borrower 
if the loan is not reinstated within the time permitted by law for reinstatement  which is normally five business days prior to the date set for the non judicial trustee s sale  we may then sell the property at a foreclosure sale 
in general  if we have elected to pursue a non judicial foreclosure  we are not permitted under applicable law to obtain a deficiency judgment against the borrower  even if the security property is insufficient to cover the balance owed 
at these foreclosure sales  we generally acquire title to the property

as a percentage of its loan category  residential one to four units decreased from at year end to at year end  while subprime residential one to four units decreased from at year end to at year end a higher incidence of delinquency is expected on subprime loans as these borrowers have a history of delinquencies for which we charge higher interest rates to compensate for that risk 
in addition  the loan to value ratio on these loans is generally lower thereby providing more equity protection against loss

the audit committee of the board of directors quarterly reviews the overall asset quality  the adequacy of valuation allowances on classified and non classified assets  and our adherence to policies and procedures regarding asset classification and valuation through reports from the director of internal asset review and others 
we use an internal asset review system and loss allowance methodology designed to provide for timely recognition of problem assets and adequate general valuation allowances to cover asset losses 
our current asset monitoring process includes the use of asset classifications to segregate the assets  largely loans and real estate  into various risk categories 
we use the various asset classifications as a means of measuring risk for determining the valuation allowance at a point in time 
we currently use a six grade system to classify our assets 
the current grades are pass  watch  special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
we consider substandard  doubtful and loss assets classified assets for regulatory purposes 
a brief description of these classifications follows the pass classification represents a level of credit quality which contains no well defined deficiency or weakness 
the watch classification identifies an asset that currently contains no well defined deficiency or weakness  but warrants close monitoring eg  loans to facilitate the sale of real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
this category may also be used for assets upgraded from lower classifications where continuing monitoring is deemed appropriate 
a special mention asset does not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification  but does possess a correctable deficiency or potential weakness deserving management s close attention 
substandard assets have a well defined weakness or weaknesses 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
an asset classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values 
we consider doubtful to be a temporary classification until resolution of pending weakness issues enables us to more clearly define the potential for loss

navigation links that portion of an asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of so little value that its continuance as an asset  without establishment of a specific valuation allowance  is not warranted 
a loss classification does not mean that an asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value  but rather it is not reasonable to defer writing off or providing for all or a portion of the asset even though partial recovery may occur 
we will generally classify as loss the balance of the asset that is greater than the net fair value of the asset unless we can expect payment from another source 
therefore  the amount of an asset classified as loss reflects the specific valuation allowance established for the particular asset 
specific valuation allowances are not includable in determining the bank s total regulatory capital 
the ots has the authority to require us to change our asset classifications 
if the change results in an asset being classified in whole or in part as loss  a specific allowance must be established against the amount so classified or that amount must be charged off 
ots guidelines set forth quantitative benchmarks as a starting point for the determination of appropriate levels of general valuation allowances 
the ots directs its examiners to rely on management s estimates of adequate general valuation allowances if the bank s process for determining adequate allowances is deemed to be sound 
the allowance for losses on loans and real estate are maintained at an amount management deems adequate to cover inherent losses 
we have implemented and use an internal asset review system and loan loss allowance methodology designed to provide for the detection of problem assets and an adequate allowance to cover loan losses 
in determining the allowance for loan losses related to specific large loans loans over million  we evaluate the loans on an individual basis  including an analysis of the creditworthiness  cash flows and financial status of the borrower  and the condition and the estimated value of the collateral 
generally  we review all loans under million by analyzing their performance and composition of collateral as a whole because of their relatively homogeneous nature  unless an individual loan or borrower relationship warrants separate analysis 
given the above evaluations  the amount of the allowance is based upon the total of general valuation allowances  allocated allowances and an unallocated allowance 
we utilize the asset classifications from our internal asset review process in the following manner to determine the amount of our allowances general valuation allowances this element relates to assets with no well defined deficiency or weakness ie  assets classified pass or watch and takes into consideration loss that is imbedded within the portfolio but has not yet been realized 
generally  we believe that borrowers are impacted by events well in advance of a lender s knowledge that may ultimately result in loan default and eventual loss 
examples of such loss causing events would be job loss  divorce or medical crisis in the case of single family residential and consumer loans  or loss of a major tenant in the case of commercial real estate loans 
we determine general valuation allowances by applying against asset balances the associated factors for each major asset type that consider past loss experience and asset duration 
allocated allowances this element relates to assets with well defined deficiencies or weaknesses ie  assets classified special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
we calculate losses on an ongoing basis by credit classification for each major asset type 
factors based upon those loss statistics are applied against current classified asset balances to determine the amount of allocated allowances 
included in these allowances are those amounts associated with assets where it is probable that the value of the asset has been impaired and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if we determine our carrying value of the asset exceeds the net fair value and no alternative payment source exists  then we record a specific allowance for the amount of that difference 
unallocated allowance this element is more subjective and is reviewed quarterly to take into consideration estimation errors and economic trends that are not necessarily captured in determining the general valuation and allocated allowances

impaired loans exclude large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment 
generally  loans we collectively review for impairment include all single family loans and performing multi family and non residential loans having principal balances of less than million  unless an individual loan or borrower relationship warrants separate analysis

our commitments to originate fixed and variable rate mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment 
undisbursed loan funds on construction projects and unused lines of credit on home equity and commercial loans include committed funds not disbursed 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
paragraph page 
navigation links of eitf specifies that an impairment would be considered other than temporary unless a the investor has the ability and intent to hold an investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for the recovery of the fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment and b evidence indicating that the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
a company s liquidity and capital requirements should be considered when assessing its intent and ability to hold an investment for a reasonable period of time that would allow the fair value of the investment to recover up to or beyond its cost 
a pattern of selling investments prior to the forecasted fair value recovery may call into question a company s intent 
in addition  the severity and duration of the impairment should also be considered when determining whether the impairment is other than temporary 
this guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after june  with the exception of paragraphs of eitf  which will be deliberated further 
this delay does not suspend the requirement to recognize other than temporary impairments as required by existing authoritative literature 
the outcome of this deliberation may accelerate the recognition of losses from declines in value on debt securities due to interest rates  however  it is not anticipated to have a significant impact on stockholders equity as changes in market value of available for sale securities are already included in accumulated other comprehensive income
