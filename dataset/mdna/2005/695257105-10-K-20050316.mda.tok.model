executive overview business pactiv s primary business is the manufacture and sale of consumer and specialty packaging products for the consumer  foodservice food packaging  and protective and flexible packaging markets 
the company s consumer products include plastic  aluminum  and paper based products  such as waste bags  food storage bags  and disposable tableware and cookware  sold under such well known brand names as hefty r  baggies r  hefty r onezip r  hefty r cinchsak r  hefty r the gripper r  hefty r zoo pals r  kordite r  and ez foil tm 
foodservice and food packaging products include foam  clear plastic  aluminum  pressed paperboard  and molded fiber packaging for customers in the food distribution channel  including wholesalers  supermarkets  and packer processors  who prepare and process food for consumption 
the company s protective packaging products are generally used to protect and cushion various commercial and industrial products from the point of manufacture to the point of delivery or pick up 
pactiv s flexible packaging products are used mainly in food  medical  pharmaceutical  chemical  and hygienic applications  and often involve custom design 
the company operates manufacturing facilities in countries worldwide 
pactiv generates sales and profits through the arms length sale of its products to a wide array of customers  including grocery stores  mass merchandisers  discount chains  restaurants  distributors  fabricators  and directly to end users worldwide 
costs are incurred in connection with the manufacture and sale of these products and are recorded as either cost of sales or selling  general  and administrative expenses 
greater than of pactiv s sales comes from products made from different types of plastics 
the principal raw materials used to manufacture these products are plastic resins  including polystyrene  polyethylene  polypropylene  polyvinyl chloride  and apet 
plastic resin prices can be volatile and are a function of  among other things  the availability of production capacity  oil  natural gas  and other energy related feedstock costs  and geopolitical circumstances 
the company generates cash by collecting receivables on profitable sales in a timely manner  effectively managing inventory levels  optimizing vendor payment terms  utilizing tax minimization strategies  and optimizing other elements of working capital 
pactiv uses the cash it generates to invest in property  plant  and equipment and acquisitions to provide long term sales  profit  and cash flow growth  to retire debt  and  from time to time  to repurchase its stock 
the company anticipates that its cash flow from operations will continue to be sufficient to fund its investing and financing activities 
pactiv has pension plans that cover substantially all of its employees 
in addition  the company  in conjunction with its spin off from tenneco inc tenneco in  became the sponsor of retirement plans covering participating employees of certain former subsidiaries and affiliates of tenneco 
pactiv records net pension income on its pension plans as an offset to selling  general  and administrative expenses  however  management typically excludes the effect of pension income and pension assets and liabilities in assessing performance and returns of the company 
several opportunities and challenges may influence the company s continued growth 
near term risks include the impact of energy market volatility on resin costs  the ability to increase selling prices  and the continued effectiveness of the company s productivity and procurement initiatives 
longer term  the company faces potential changes in consumer demand patterns  possible supplier and customer consolidations  potential increases in foreign based competition  and possible growth in unbranded products market share 
the company expects to continue to be successful by adjusting selling prices to offset resin price movements  implementing aggressive cost management and productivity programs  leveraging its existing customer base into new distribution channels  introducing innovative new products  and making strategic acquisitions 
significant trends and other the principal raw materials used to manufacture the company s products are plastic resins  principally polystyrene and polyethylene 
average industry prices for polystyrene were approximately higher at the end of than at the end of  driven principally by higher oil and benzene prices  while average industry prices for polyethylene rose by approximately over the same period  fueled by higher natural gas prices 
in response to the significant escalation in resin costs  the company raised selling prices in many areas of its business during  which were effective in offsetting approximately of the resin cost increases 
raw material costs will likely continue to be a source of uncertainty for the company in the near term future 
resin vendors have announced additional price increases effective in the first and second quarters of  however  at this time it is not clear whether these price increases will be successfully implemented as announced  or at all 
the company is closely monitoring the resin marketplace in order to respond quickly to any material cost increases 
the company is also sensitive to other energy related cost movements  particularly with respect to transportation and logistics costs 
historically  the company has been able to mitigate higher energy related costs with productivity improvements and other cost reductions  however  future significant energy related cost increases may not be fully offset with productivity initiatives 
the company recently announced the launch of a major new product family in its consumer tableware business  and additional new product launches are expected to occur in to support these growth initiatives and the hefty r ultraflex tm waste bag line that was launched in the third quarter of  the company s investment in advertising and promotion a p in is expected to increase between million and million compared with the impact on pretax profit of higher a p spending  net of operating income on incremental new product sales  is expected to be approximately million to million in year compared with results of continuing operations sales change dollars in millions consumer products foodservice food packaging   protective and flexible packaging total   total sales increased million  or  in excluding the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates million  sales grew  driven primarily by volume growth in the base business million and acquisitions million  as well as price increases million

sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual period after june  the impact of adopting sfas r cannot be predicted at this time  since it depends on levels of future share based payments

sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as cash flow from financing activities  rather than its current classification in cash flow from operating activities

amounts recognized for such excess tax deduction benefits were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies following are pactiv s accounting policies that in management s opinion involve the exercise of considerable judgment and the use of estimates  and have the most significant impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition the company recognizes sales when the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which is generally considered to have occurred as products are shipped 
in arriving at net sales  the company estimates the amount of deductions from sales that are likely to be earned or taken by customers in conjunction with incentive programs such as volume rebates  early payment discounts  and coupon redemptions 
such estimates are based on historical trends and are reviewed quarterly for possible revision 
the company believes the amount of sales deductions reflected in net sales for the months ended december   is reasonable 
in the event that future sales deduction trends vary significantly from past or expected trends  reported sales may increase or decrease by a material amount 
inventory valuation the company s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
a portion of inventories and at december   and  respectively is valued using the last in  first out lifo method of accounting 
management prefers the lifo method in that it reflects in cost of sales the current cost of the company s raw materials primarily plastic resins  which can be volatile 
if the company had valued inventories using the first in  first out fifo accounting method  net income would have been million  or per share  higher in  million  or per share  higher in  and million  or per share  higher in the company s protective and flexible packaging business values its inventory using fifo or average cost methods 
many of this business operations are located in countries in which the use of the lifo method of inventory accounting is not permitted 
management periodically reviews inventory balances to identify slow moving and or obsolete items 
this determination is based on a number of factors  including new product introductions  changes in consumer demand patterns  and historical usage trends 
pension plans the company accounts for pension plans in accordance with requirements of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
pension plan income million  million  and million for the months ended december    and  respectively is included in the statement of income as an offset to selling  general  and administrative expenses 
it is estimated that the company s noncash pension income will decline to million in projections of pension income are based on a number of factors  including estimates of future returns on pension plan assets  assumptions pertaining to the amortization of actuarial gains losses  expectations regarding employee compensation  and assumptions related to participant turnover  retirement age  and life expectancy 
in developing its assumption regarding the rate of return on pension plan assets  the company estimates future returns on various classes of assets  risk free rates of return  and long term inflation rates 
since inception in  the pension plans annual rate of return on assets has averaged 
historically  the plans have invested approximately of assets in equity securities and in fixed income investments 
after considering all of these factors  the company concluded that the use of a rate of return on assets assumption was appropriate for holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percentage point change in the rate of return on assets assumption would impact the company s pretax pension income by approximately million 
the company s discount rate assumption is based on the composite yield on a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds constructed with durations to match the plans future benefit obligations 
in this connection  the company used a discount rate assumption of for both and holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percentage point change in the discount rate would impact the company s pretax pension income by approximately million 
the company utilizes a market related method for calculating the value of plan assets 
this method recognizes the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets over a year period 
resulting unrecognized gains or losses  along with other actuarial gains and losses  are amortized using the corridor approach discussed in sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
to manage these risks  the company  from time to time  enters into various hedging contracts in accordance with established policies and procedures 
the company does not use hedging instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any transactions involving leveraged derivatives 
foreign currency exchange the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates  primarily related to the british pound and the euro 
associated gains or losses offset gains or losses on underlying assets or liabilities 
in managing foreign currency risk  the company aggregates existing positions and hedges residual exposures through third party derivative contracts

see note for additional information 
prior to the spin off  the company entered into an interest rate swap to hedge its exposure to interest rate movements 
the company settled this swap in november  incurring a million loss  which is being recognized as additional interest expense over the average life of the underlying debt 
in the first quarter of  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert floating rate debt on its synthetic lease obligations to fixed rate debt 
this action was taken to reduce the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
during the first quarter of  the company exited these swap agreements  and the resulting accumulated net loss million at december  is being expensed over the remaining life of the underlying obligation
