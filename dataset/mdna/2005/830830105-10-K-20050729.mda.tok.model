table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the corporation to make certain estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
estimates are periodically evaluated using historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following accounting policies are considered to require significant estimates product warranties as referenced in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  manufactured homes are sold with a fifteen month warranty and recreational vehicles are sold with a two year or less warranty 
estimated warranty costs are accrued at the time of sale based upon sales  historical claims experience and management s judgment regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims 
significant changes in these factors could have a material impact on future results of operations 
workers compensation insurance the corporation is insured for expenses associated with workers compensation 
costs are accrued based on management s estimates of future medical claims developed by consulting actuaries at the carrier that insures the corporation 
accruals are made up to a specified limit per individual injured and for an aggregate limit determined by the carrier

other matters the provisions for federal income taxes in each year approximates the statutory rate and for state income taxes reflects current state rates effective for the period based upon activities within the taxable entities 
the consolidated financial statements included in this report reflect transactions in the dollar values in which they were incurred and  therefore  do not attempt to measure the impact of inflation 
the corporation  however  experienced in fiscal significant increases in the cost of lumber  lumber related materials and steel 
although the corporation was unable to recover all of the increases in the first half of fiscal  on a long term basis it has demonstrated an ability to adjust selling prices in reaction to changing costs due to inflation

forward looking information certain statements in this report are considered forward looking as indicated by the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve uncertainties that may cause actual results to materially differ from expectations as of the report date 
these uncertainties include but are not limited to cyclical nature of the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries general or seasonal weather conditions affecting sales potential periodic inventory adjustments by independent retailers availability of wholesale and retail financing interest rate levels impact of inflation cost of labor and raw materials competitive pressures on pricing and promotional costs catastrophic events impacting insurance costs the availability of insurance coverage for various risks to the corporation consumer confidence and economic uncertainty market demographics management s ability to attract and retain executive officers and key personnel increased global tensions  market disruption resulting from a terrorist or other attack and any armed conflict involving the united states 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation invests in united states government securities 
these securities are typically held until maturity and are therefore classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost 
changes in interest rates do not have a significant effect on the fair value of these investments
