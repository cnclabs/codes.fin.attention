overview we furnish engineering consulting and control system services to the petroleum refining  petrochemical  pipeline  production and processing industries 
our business consists of two segments engineering and systems 
our engineering segment offers engineering consulting services to clients for the development  management and turnkey execution of engineering projects  construction management  and inspection services 
our systems segment designs  assembles  programs  installs  integrates and services control and instrumentation systems for specific applications in the energy and processing related industries 
contract revenue and contract costs are recorded primarily using the percentage of completion cost to cost method 
under this method  revenue on long term contracts is recognized in the ratio that contract costs actually incurred bears to total estimated costs 
revenue and profit on long term contracts are subject to revision throughout the lives of the contracts and any required adjustments are made in the period in which the revisions become known 
losses on contracts are recorded in full as they are identified 
in the course of providing our services  we routinely provide major engineering  materials  equipment and subcontractor services 
generally  these materials  equipment and subcontractor costs are passed through to our clients and  in accordance with industry practice and generally accepted accounting principles  are included in revenue 
because the use of subcontractor services can change significantly from project to project  changes in revenue may not be indicative of business trends 
for analytical purposes only  we segregate from our total revenue the revenues recorded from non labor material  equipment and subcontractor costs  and the revenue derived from material assets or companies acquired during the current year  as well as the revenue recognized from material assets or companies acquired during the first months following their respective dates of acquisition 
revenue recognized from acquired assets or companies during such first months is referred to as acquisition revenue 
we also segregate gross profits and sg a expenses derived from material assets or company acquisitions on the same basis as we segregate revenues 
our other contract costs include professional compensation and related benefits  together with certain direct and indirect variable overhead costs 
professional compensation and related benefits represent the majority of these costs 
operating sg a expense includes management and staff compensation  office costs such as rents and utilities  depreciation  amortization  travel and other expenses generally unrelated to specific client contracts  but directly related to the support of a segment s operation 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued overview continued corporate sg a expense is comprised primarily of marketing and proposal costs  as well as costs related to the executive  finance  accounting  safety  human resources and information technology departments and other costs generally unrelated to specific client projects  but which can vary as costs are incurred to support corporate activities and initiatives 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data derived from our consolidated statements of operations and indicates percentage of total revenue for each item

the increase in non labor revenue during represented of the increase in total engineering revenue for the year 
the million additional non labor revenue resulted from an increase in non labor revenue of million on a co generation project that began in  offset by in lower non labor revenue from a cyclohexane project that began in both the co generation and cyclohexane projects are being executed out of our beaumont office and both are expected to be complete in during any reporting period non labor revenue could have a significant impact on total revenue  but normally such non labor revenue would represent lower margin activity on epc type projects 
the non labor based revenue for engineering was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
by comparison  labor based revenue  without the addition of labor based revenue from acquisitions  totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
non labor revenue includes certain material  equipment and subcontractor cost passed through to clients with no mark up or at a mark up well below that normally achieved on labor revenue 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  non labor revenue is included in total revenue 
non labor revenue is expected to increase in due to activity on both the coffeyville and frontier projects 
the increase of million in engineering labor revenue during came primarily from additional labor revenue of million through the tulsa office  million through the beaumont office and million from all other office locations 
our engineering segment has been successful in obtaining major projects in the petroleum refining industry in the mid continent area for the tulsa office  but we do not currently have a large project that would replace the co generation project when it is completed by our beaumont office 
in  the company was awarded two significant projects to be completed primarily out of our tulsa office 
coffeyville resources refining marketing  llc crrm has entered into an agreement with englobal for detailed engineering and procurement services for crrm s ultra low sulfur diesel fuel facilities at its coffeyville  kansas refinery on a cost reimbursable basis 
we estimate that the agreement will result in approximately  man hours in engineering and related activities in addition to a significant amount of revenue attributable to the procurement of materials and equipment 
the project began in january and is scheduled to conclude in the third quarter of frontier refining  inc has awarded englobal a contract to provide lump sum turnkey services for engineering  procurement and construction for modifications to produce ultra low sulfur diesel at frontier s cheyenne  wyoming refinery 
the company estimates revenue from the frontier contract to be approximately million 
the project began in february and is scheduled to complete in the spring of the systems segment contributed of our total revenue for the year  as its revenue declined  from million in to million in revenue in our systems segment began with a project backlog of million  representing the largest booking of new work in the segment s history 
during the fourth quarter of  the systems segment was awarded projects totaling million from honeywell to build eight turnkey remote instrument enclosures ries of which six units are scheduled for completion during the second quarter and additional units following in the third and fourth quarters of in the first quarter of  honeywell awarded the company three additional turnkey ries totaling million with one unit scheduled for delivery in the second quarter and two units scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued year ended december  compared to year ended december  continued revenue from acquired companies accounted for of our total revenue during  increasing by million or from million in revenue in to million in revenue in revenue recognized from acquired assets or companies during the first months of their operation within englobal is referred to as acquisition revenue 
acquisition revenue in includes revenue of million  million  million  million and  from edg  cis  petro chem  senftleber and amtech  respectively 
we formerly operated a third segment  the manufacturing segment 
certain assets of this segment were sold in december and march and its financial results during and are reported in income loss from discontinued operations 
gross profit gross profit from engineering labor increased million or from million in to million in gross profit from our tulsa location improved million or from  in to million in gross profits based on engineering labor revenue from all other engineering operations decreased  or 
gross profit from labor declined as a percentage of labor revenue from in to in gross margin from in office projects increased from in to in only to be offset by higher non project labor cost invested in estimating larger epc projects and in internal growth initiatives such as low sulfur diesel 
margins from our field service operation were lower by 
primarily due to the impact of integration costs and recognition of lower profits on million in revenue generated by the acquisition of cis during the last quarter of gross profit from engineering non labor revenue declined  or from  in to  in as a direct result of the decrease of million in non labor revenue on the cyclohexane project 
the coffeyville project began in january and includes cost reimbursable procurement services including a fee on approximately million in materials and equipment 
gross profit for our systems segment declined  or from million in to million in competitive market pressures on pricing  project management  cost containment against project budgets  and stronger support service controls continue to provide challenges for management in response to growth initiatives and record backlog levels 
the acquisition of contract rights and other assets from infotech during the fourth quarter of could have a short term negative impact on the systems segment s gross profit until new employees and new projects are fully integrated into the company s operations 
gross profits from acquisitions increased million or from  in to million in gross profit from acquired assets or companies during their first months of operations within the company is recorded and referred to as acquisition gross profit 
acquisition gross profit in includes gross profit of     and  from edg  cis  petro chem  senftleber and amtech  respectively 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued year ended december  compared to year ended december  continued selling  general and administrative sg a expenses selling  general and administrative expenses not directly related to acquisitions remained level at million for both and and as a percentage of total revenue decreased from in to in in march  the company announced organizational changes intended to reduce overhead and enhance profitability 
the company eliminated four operational facilities and consolidated offices to improve efficiency 
for example  effective january  within the systems segment  ecp relocated offices and shop facilities into the same facility as esi resulting in improved shop personnel utilization  reduction of duplicative overhead functions and reduction of facility expenses 
as a result  during  the systems segment sg a expenses decreased  or from million in to million in corporate sg a charges increased  due to additional software enhancements to our billings system to meet client format demands  plus  related to proposal and internal growth initiatives 
engineering sg a expenses increased  due to numerous miscellaneous items 
sg a expenses from acquisitions increased million from  in to million in sg a expenses from acquired assets or companies during their first months of operations within the company have been recorded and are referred to as acquisition under sg a expenses 
acquisition sg a in includes million   and  from edg  cis  petro chem respectively  plus  for all other acquisition activity 
operating profit operating profit remained constant at million in and  decreasing as a percentage of total revenue from in to in if total revenue and total operating profit are both adjusted whereby the impact of non labor material  equipment and subcontractor cost are eliminated from both total revenue and total operating profit  our adjusted operating profit as a percentage of adjusted revenue would have increased from to 
other income expense other income expense changed from  expense in to  income in the expense in was the result of a book basis loss on the sale of the vacant office building in baton rouge  as compared to the income in  which resulted from a legal settlement 
provision for income taxes additional tax expense during the year increased the effective tax rate to from in the effective tax now and in the future will be approximately 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue total revenue increased by million or from revenues of million in to million in the revenue growth for compared to is primarily attributable to the engineering segment  which was awarded engineering  procurement and construction epc phases of major projects 
the engineering segment realized an increase in its engineering revenues of million primarily due to the co generation and cyclohexane projects 
these projects contributed revenues of more than million during  including non labor revenue from materials  equipment and subcontractors charges of million 
usually the engineering segment s revenues are derived from direct labor 
procurement activities contributed to a significant increase in revenues but at a lower mark up on these epc projects 
the labor based revenue for engineering were million and million in and  respectively 
by comparison  the procurement based revenues were million and million in and  respectively 
performance in the other areas of the engineering segment was mixed 
significant growth occurred in the tulsa area during with an increase in revenues of  from million in to million in this growth was due to a concerted marketing effort to bring work to this location 
the houston area  which has traditionally serviced the pipeline industry  had lower than expected sales 
the pipeline industry continues to be over leveraged  and many capital expansions have been on hold for over two years while the industry focused on debt reduction 
the economy in the baton rouge area continued to be flat during the early part of  but improved in the fourth quarter 
however  competition in this area resulted in lower margins 
revenues for decreased from by million in the baton rouge area 
the fourth quarter showed signs of improvement as baton rouge revenues improved during the last quarter in as compared to the same quarter in the systems segment s revenues improved  from million in to million in esi s revenues improved million from million in to million in this growth was attributable to large fixed price sales of remote instrument enclosures to two clients 
offsetting this increase was a decrease in revenues at ecp of million 
as of january  ecp has physically moved into the houston esi location to help reduce its overhead expenses by sharing employees and reducing rent and utility costs 
eti  a previously dormant entity  which was reactivated in  and senftleber  a november acquisition  generated combined revenues of million in the manufacturing segment was discontinued when certain assets of thermaire were sold in december operational results of this segment are reflected in the caption income loss from discontinued operations 
gross profit gross profit for the company increased by million or from million in to million in the margin as a percentage of revenue  however  decreased from in to in this decrease is primarily due to the increase in epc types of projects worked in the engineering segment 
the gross profit for the engineering segment increased by million or from to the engineering segment s gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from in to in eei has many contracts pursuant to which englobal employees are assigned to work at client facilities 
these contracts are generally low risk  with virtually no overhead  and therefore  low margin 
also  the engineering service segment  which normally functions as a source of professional labor  was awarded epc jobs in and with large quantities of material and subcontract work 
these jobs have traditionally had low mark ups on the materials and subcontractors work  which decreases the company s margins 
engineering contributed of the total gross profits in the systems segment gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in the decline in gross profits was primarily due to cost overruns on fixed price projects and competitive market pressures on contract pricing 
the cost overruns occurred due to rapid growth in esi s revenues 
management initiated stronger administrative and support services controls in response to the cost overruns 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued year ended december  compared to year ended december  continued the company combined three employee medical insurance plans into one self insured health plan at the beginning of claim trends throughout the year were lower than expected levels based on past years experiences 
adjustments to lower the insurance reserve were made in the third and fourth quarters totaling million  which resulted in improved gross profits in both the engineering and systems segments 
the engineering segment received approximately of the benefit  and the systems segment received approximately of the benefit 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in primarily due to the creation of a business development department  which substantially combined all the marketing activities of the engineering segment into one centralized group and added several new marketing representatives 
operating profit operating profit increased by million or from million in to million in however  operating profits decreased as a percentage of total revenue from in to in this decrease was the result of the overall higher revenues and lower profit margins 
other income expense other income decreased from  to expense of  from to  respectively 
the expense in is the loss on the sale of the vacant building in baton rouge  as compared to the income in  which resulted from a legal settlement 
provision for income taxes the company received a one time tax benefit of approximately  in from the recapture of depreciation on segregated expenditures in company owned buildings in baton rouge 
the one time tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate for income taxes from in to 
the company does not expect the benefit to recur in future tax periods 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have satisfied our cash requirements through operations and borrowings under a revolving credit facility 
the company s current credit facility is with comerica bank comerica and consists of a line of credit maturing july  the loan agreement positions comerica as senior to all other debt 
the line of credit is limited to million subject to loan covenant restrictions 
the comerica credit facility is collateralized by substantially all the assets of the company 
as of december   the outstanding balance on the line of credit was million and we had working capital of million 
our total long term debt outstanding on december  was million see note  an increase from million as of december  our long term debt includes million outstanding under our revolving credit facility with comerica  and other long term debt of million 
under the terms and conditions of our revolving credit facility  as of december   we have additional borrowing capacity of approximately million after consideration of borrowing base limitations 
we are not currently subject to any other standby letters of credit  guarantees  repurchase obligations  or other commitments 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
the company has been awarded a significant project with coffeyville resources refining marketing  llc crrm and entered into an agreement for engineering and procurement services to provide detailed engineering and procurement services for crrm s ultra low sulphur diesel fuel facilities at its coffeyville  kansas refinery on a cost reimbursable basis 
we estimate that the agreement will result in approximately  man hours in engineering and related activities in addition to a significant amount of revenue attributable to the procurement of materials and equipment 
the terms of the agreement require that any progress payments made by crrm for project items must be secured by one or more irrevocable stand by letters of credit issued on the account of englobal 
the project began in january and is scheduled to complete in the third quarter of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued liquidity and capital resources continued the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period and total thereafter in thousands long term debt   capital leases operating leases      total contractual cash obligations       we have several long term notes that are subordinate to the comerica debt 
o  in two notes of  each to sterling planet and edgi  each bearing interest at and maturing in principal amounts of  are paid quarterly with accrued interest 
the sterling planet and edgi notes were issued as part of the purchase of certain assets of edgi 
o  payable to significant pei shareholders resulting from termination of the agreements see note in consolidated financial statements  payable in two remaining equal installments before december  and o  in four notes to cleveland inspection services  inc  cis technical  inc  and f 
d 
curtis  each discounted using interest rate maturing in principal amounts of  are paid quarterly 
the notes were issued as part of the purchase of certain assets of cleveland inspection services  inc o  in a note to infotech engineering  inc  bearing interest at and maturing in principal amounts of  are paid annually with accrued interest 
the note was issued as a part of the acquisition of certain assets of infotech engineering  inc cash flow operating activities required the use of million in cash for the fiscal year ended december  during the fiscal years ended december  and  operating activities provided net cash totaling million and million  respectively 
much of the decrease in our cash flow from operating activities occurred early in the fourth quarter of due to the acquisition of cis which was completed in october subsequently  cash flow returned to a positive position in january as the integration of the cis acquisition was substantially completed 
investing activities used cash totaling million in  compared to  in and million in in  our investing activities consisted of capital additions of million primarily for computers and leasehold improvements to our beaumont office 
we used  in the fourth quarter of to close the acquisitions of edgi  amtech  cleveland inspection services  inc  and infotech 
financing activities provided cash totaling million in and used cash totaling million and million during and  respectively 
our primary financing mechanism is our revolving line of credit 
the line of credit has been used principally to finance accounts receivable 
during  our borrowings  net of payments  on the line of credit were million  and we repaid an aggregate of million on our short term and long term debt 
non cash transactions include million notes payable issued related to acquisitions and  note payable issued for treasury stock 
non cash transactions include the issuance of stock dividends of  and  during and  respectively 
during  our preferred stock was converted to common stock valued at  we also acquired insurance with notes payable of   and  in   and  respectively 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued cash flow continued the company believes that it has available necessary cash for operations for the next months 
cash and the availability of cash could be materially restricted if circumstances prevent the timely internal processing of invoices into accounts receivable  if such accounts are not collected timely  or if our project mix shifts from cost reimbursable to fixed cost contracts during significant periods of growth 
if losses occur  we may not be able to meet our monthly fixed charge ratio covenant under our credit facility with comerica 
in that event  if we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment of the covenant  we may be unable to make further borrowings and may be required to repay all loans then outstanding under the credit facility 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or otherwise 
furthermore  we have not engaged in energy or commodity trading activities and do not anticipate doing so in the future  nor do we have any transactions involving unconsolidated entities or special purpose entities 
asset management we typically sell our products and services on short term credit and seek to minimize our credit risk by performing credit checks and conducting our own collection efforts 
our trade accounts receivable increased to million from million as of december  and  respectively  primarily due to increased revenue growth and timing issues related to delays in client payments to both eei and esi totaling million each 
trade receivables increased million and million respectively for cis and edg  primarily due to a delay in integration of cis billings immediately following the acquisition and a large foreign receivable from a client of edg 
delays in client payments beyond contract terms specifying a shortened five day payment cycle and our extending day payment terms to a major client have contributed to the increase in the number of days outstanding for trade accounts receivable from days at december  to days at december  our actual bad debt expense has been approximately of revenues for the periods ending december  and we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from  to  or and of the trade accounts receivable balance for and  respectively 
related party transactions englobal engineering  inc leases office space from pei investments  a joint venture in which englobal engineering  inc has a one third interest  michael l 
burrow the company s ceo has a one third interest  and a stockholder who owns less than of the company s common stock has a one third interest 
rentals paid under the lease were   and  for  and  respectively 
the lease expires in we believe that this lease is at a commercially reasonable rental rate 
risk management in performing services for our clients  we could potentially be liable for breach of contract  personal injury  property damage or negligence  including professional errors and omissions 
we often agree to indemnify our clients for losses and expenses incurred as a result of our negligence and  in certain cases  the concurrent negligence of our clients 
our quality control and assurance program includes a control function to establish standards and procedures for performance and for documentation of project tasks  and an assurance function to audit and to monitor compliance with procedures and quality standards 
we maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and third party property damage  professional errors and omissions  and workers compensation coverage  which we consider sufficient to insure against these risks  subject to self insured amounts 
seasonality holidays and employee vacations during our fourth quarter exert downward pressure on revenues for that quarter  which is only partially offset by the year end efforts on the part of many clients to spend any remaining funds budgeted for engineering services or capital expenditures during the year 
the annual budgeting and approval process under which these clients operate is normally not completed until after the beginning of each new year  which can depress results for the first quarter 
principally due to these factors  our revenues during the first and fourth quarters generally tend to be lower than in the second and third quarters 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued critical accounting policies revenue recognition our revenues are largely composed of engineering service revenue and product sales 
the majority of our services are provided through time and material contracts also referred to as cost plus contracts  many of which have not to exceed provisions that place a cap on the revenue that we may receive under a particular contract 
these time and material billings are produced every two weeks 
on occasion  we serve as purchasing agent by procuring subcontractors  material and equipment on behalf of a client and passing the cost on to the client with no mark up or profit 
in accordance with statement of position sop  revenues and costs for these type purchases are not included in total revenues and costs 
for financial reporting this pass through type of transaction is reported net 
profits and losses on fixed fee contracts are recorded on the percentage of completion method of accounting  measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date to estimated total contract costs for each contract 
contract costs include amounts paid to subcontractors 
anticipated losses on uncompleted construction contracts are charged to operations as soon as such losses can be estimated 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
the asset  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed on fixed fee contracts 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated profits on uncompleted contracts represents amounts billed in excess of revenues recognized on fixed fee contracts 
goodwill in conjunction with each acquisition  we must allocate the cost of the acquired entity to the assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
as additional information becomes available  adjustments may be made to the original estimates within a short time subsequent to the acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized but instead is periodically assessed for impairment 
the impairment testing entails estimating current market value of the segments  based on management s estimate of market conditions including pricing  demand  competition  operating costs and other factors 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired involves professional judgment and is ultimately based on management s assessment of the value of the assets acquired 
we believe our estimates for these items are reasonable  but there is no assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
consistent with sfas  we have not amortized goodwill related to the merger with petrocon  but instead tested the balance for impairment 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim period that begins after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the company is currently evaluating the statement s transition methods and does not expect this statement to have an effect materially different than that of the pro forma sfas disclosures provided in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued recent accounting pronouncements continued in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
this statement amends apb opinion no 
to permit the exchange of non monetary assets to be recorded on a carry over basis when the non monetary assets do not have commercial substance 
this is an exception to the basic measurement principal of measuring a non monetary asset exchange at fair value 
a non monetary asset exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this standard is not expected to impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities more commonly known as special purpose entities or spe s 
in december  fasb issued fin no 
r which replaced fin and clarified arb this interpretation provides guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity and determine when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests and results of operations of a variable interest entity should be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the enterprise that will absorb a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses or receive a majority of the expected residual returns as a result of holding variable interests 
this fin requires the consolidation of results of variable interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
as of december   the company did not own an interest in a variable interest entity that met the consolidation requirements and as such the adoption of fin no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no there are no investments at december  accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
as of december  and  the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
the company s primary interest rate risk relates to its variable rate line of credit debt obligation  which totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
assuming a increase in the interest rate on this variable rate debt obligation ie  an increase from the actual average interest rate of as of december   to an average interest rate of  annual interest expense would have been approximately  higher in based on the annual average balance 
the company does not have any interest rate swap or exchange agreements 
the company has no market risk exposure in the areas of interest rate risk from investments because the company did not have an investment portfolio as of december  currently  the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities nor is the company exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuation
