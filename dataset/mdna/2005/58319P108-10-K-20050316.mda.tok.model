description of business we are a publicly traded specialty risk management company  with an emphasis on alternative market insurance and risk management solutions for agents  professional and trade associations  and insureds of all sizes 
the alternative market includes a wide range of approaches to financing and managing risk exposures  such as captives  rent a captives  risk retention and risk purchasing groups  governmental pools and trusts  and self insurance plans 
the alternative market developed as a result of the historical volatility in the cost and availability of traditional commercial insurance coverages  and usually involves some form of self insurance or risk sharing on the part of the client 
we develop and manage alternative risk management programs for defined client groups and their members 
we also operate as an insurance agency representing unaffiliated insurance companies in placing insurance coverages for policyholders 
we define our business segments as specialty risk management operations and agency operations 
on june   we sold  shares of newly issued common stock at per share in a public offering 
on june   the underwriters exercised their over allotment option to acquire  of additional shares of our common stock 
after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions  and expenses  we received net proceeds from the offering of million 
we utilized million of the million raised in the public offering to pay down our line of credit by million and contributed million to the surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries 
the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
on september   we issued million of junior subordinated debentures to an unconsolidated subsidiary trust 
we received a total of million in net proceeds from the issuance of these debentures  of which million was contributed to the surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries and the remaining balance was used for general corporate purposes 
on april and may   we issued senior debentures in the amount of million and million  respectively 
the senior debentures mature in thirty years 
we contributed million of the proceeds from the senior debentures to our insurance company subsidiaries as of december  the 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued remaining proceeds from the issuance of the senior debentures may be used to support future premium growth through further contributions to our insurance company subsidiaries and general corporate purposes 
specialty risk management operations our specialty risk management operations segment focuses on specialty or niche insurance business in which we provide various services and coverages tailored to meet the specific requirements of defined client groups and their members 
these services include  risk management consulting  claims administration and handling  loss control and prevention  and reinsurance placement  along with various types of property and casualty insurance coverage  including workers compensation  commercial multiple peril  general liability  commercial auto liability  and inland marine 
insurance coverage is provided primarily to associations or similar groups of members and to specified classes of business of our agent partners 
we recognize revenue related to the services and coverages from our specialty risk management operations within seven categories net earned premiums  management fees  claims fees  loss control fees  reinsurance placement  investment income  and net realized gains losses 
we categorize our programs into three categories managed  risk sharing  and fully insured 
with managed programs  we earn service fee revenue by providing management and other services to a client s risk bearing entity  but generally do not share in the operating results 
with risk sharing programs  we participate with the client or producer in the operating results of the programs through the utilization of a captive  rent a captive or similar structure  which are reinsurance companies and are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts 
with risk sharing programs  we derive revenues from net earned premiums  fee revenue and commissions  and investment income 
in addition  we may benefit from any margin built into the ceding commissions for services we render on behalf of the risk sharing partner for the program 
with fully insured programs  we provide commercial insurance coverage and derive revenue from net earned premiums and investment income 
fully insured programs are developed in response to a specific market opportunity and generally when we believe there is potential to evolve into a risk sharing program 
agency operations we earn commission revenue through the operation of our retail property and casualty insurance agency  which was formed in the agency has grown to be one of the largest agencies in michigan and  with acquisitions  has expanded into california 
the agency operations produce commercial  personal lines  life  and accident and health insurance  for more than fifty unaffiliated insurance carriers 

table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued in recent years  we have derived our revenue from the following sources in thousands for the years ended december  revenues net earned premiums management fees claims fees loss control fees reinsurance placement investment income net realized gains specialty risk management agency operations reconciling items gain on sale of subsidiary intersegment revenue consolidated revenue the revenue included in reconciling items relates to interest income in the holding company 
intersegment revenue is related to intercompany agency commission revenue  which represents commissions received by our agency operations from our insurance company subsidiaries 
this revenue is primarily related to the conversion of an existing west coast commercial transportation program to one of our insurance company subsidiaries 
critical accounting estimates general in certain circumstances  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on a variety of factors 
there can be no assurance  however  the actual results will not be materially different than our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operation will not be affected by accounting adjustments needed to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
losses and loss adjustment expenses significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer  and the insurer s payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae  insurers establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported net losses and lae 
we establish a liability for losses and lae which represent case basis estimates of reported unpaid losses and lae on direct business  actuarial estimates of incurred but not reported losses ibnr and lae  and estimates received from ceding reinsurers on assumed business 
such liabilities  by necessity  are based upon estimates and  while we believe the amount of our reserves are adequate  the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the amount provided 
as of december   we have accrued million of gross loss and lae reserves compared with million at december  
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued when a claim is reported to one of our insurance company subsidiaries  our claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon a case by case evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim  and the policy provisions relating to the type of losses 
the estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices  as well as the experience and knowledge of the claims person 
until the claim is resolved  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by the responsible claims personnel based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the claims 
in addition to case reserves and in accordance with industry practice  we maintain estimates of reserves for losses and lae incurred but not yet reported 
we project an estimate of ultimate losses and lae at each reporting date 
the difference between i projected ultimate loss and lae reserves and ii case loss reserves and lae reserves thereon is carried as the ibnr reserve 
by using both estimates of reported claims and ibnr determined using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques  we estimate the ultimate liability for losses and lae  net of reinsurance recoverables 
our reserves are reviewed by internal and independent actuaries for adequacy on a quarterly basis 
when reviewing reserves  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of various factors such as per claim information  industry and our historical loss experience  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes in political attitudes  and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is no precise method  however  for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple factors 
the key assumptions we use in our selection of ultimate reserves include underlying actuarial methodologies  a review of current pricing and underwriting initiatives  an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels  and a detailed claims analysis with an emphasis on how aggressive claims handling may be impacting the paid and incurred loss data trends embedded in the traditional actuarial methods 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended december    and reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables represent amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid losses and lae  amounts recoverable from reinsurers on case basis estimates of reported losses and lae  and amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of ibnr losses and lae 
such recoverables  by necessity  are based upon estimates 
reinsurance does not legally discharge us from our legal liability to our insureds  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
instead of being netted against the appropriate liabilities  ceded unearned premiums and reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and lae are reported separately as assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
reinsurance recoverable balances are also subject to credit risk associated with the particular reinsurer 
in our selection of reinsurers  we continually evaluate their financial stability 
while we believe our reinsurance recoverables are collectible  the ultimate recoverable may be greater or less than the amount accrued 
at december  and  reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses were million and million  respectively 
in our risk sharing programs  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the payment of claims by our clients captive  rent a captive  large deductible programs  indemnification agreements  and on the portion of risk exposure either ceded to the captives  or retained by the clients 
the capitalization and credit worthiness of prospective risk sharing partners is one of the factors we consider upon entering into and renewing risk sharing programs 
generally  we collateralize balances due from our risk sharing partners through funds withheld trusts or letters of credit 
we have historically maintained an allowance for the potential 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued uncollectibility of certain reinsurance balances due from some risk sharing partners  some of which are in litigation 
at the end of each quarter  an analysis of these exposures is conducted to determine the potential exposure to uncollectibility 
at december   we believe this allowance is adequate 
to date  we have not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting balances from our risk sharing partners 
no assurance can be given  however  regarding the future ability of any of our risk sharing partners to meet their obligations 
investments and other than temporary impairments of securities and unrealized losses on investments our investment securities are classified as available for sale 
investments classified as available for sale are available to be sold in the future in response to our liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates  tax strategies and asset liability management strategies  among other reasons 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity  net of deferred taxes  and  accordingly have no effect on net income 
however  if there is a decline in the fair value of an investment below its cost and the decline is considered other than temporary  the amount of decline below cost is charged to earnings 
our investment portfolio is primarily invested in debt securities classified as available for sale  with a concentration in fixed income securities of a high quality 
our investment philosophy is to maximize after tax earnings and maintain significant investments in tax exempt bonds 
our policy for the valuation of temporarily impaired securities is to determine impairment based on analysis of  but not limited to  the following factors market value less than amortized cost for a six month period  rating downgrade or other credit event eg  failure to pay interest when due  financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer such as changes in technology or discontinuance of a business segment  prospects for the issuer s industry segment  and intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in market value 
we evaluate our investments in securities to determine other than temporary impairment  no less than quarterly 
investments that are deemed other than temporarily impaired are written down to their estimated net fair value and the related losses recognized in income 
there were no impaired investments written down in and there were  in impaired investments written down in there can be no assurance  however  that significant changes in the above factors in relation to our investment portfolio  will not result in future impairment charges 
at december  and  we had and securities that were in an unrealized loss position  respectively 
these investments all had unrealized losses of less than ten percent 
at december   two investments  with an aggregate  unrealized loss  have been in an unrealized loss position for more than eighteen months 
at december   one investment  with a  unrealized loss  was in an unrealized loss position for more than eighteen months 
as of december  and  gross unrealized losses on available for sale securities were million and  respectively 
revenue recognition we recognize premiums written as earned on a pro rata basis over the life of the policy term 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written that are applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force 
provisions for unearned premiums on reinsurance assumed from others are made on the basis of ceding reports when received and actuarial estimates 
in addition  certain premiums are subject to retrospective premium adjustments 
premium is recognized over the term of the insurance contract 
fee income  which includes risk management consulting  loss control  and claims services  is recognized in the period the services are provided 
claims processing fees are recognized as revenue over the estimated life of the claims  or the estimated life of the contract 
for those contracts that provide services beyond the 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued contractually defined termination date of the related contracts  fees are deferred in an amount equal to an estimate of our obligation to continue to provide services 
commission income  which includes reinsurance placement  is recorded on the later of the effective date or the billing date of the policies on which they were earned 
commission income is reported net of sub producer commission expense 
commission and other adjustments are recorded when they occur and we maintain an allowance for estimated policy cancellations and commission returns 
we review  on an ongoing basis  the collectibility of our receivables and establish an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts 
as of december  and  the allowance for uncollectibles on receivables was million and million  respectively 
legal contingencies we are subject at times to various claims  lawsuits and proceedings relating principally to alleged errors or omissions in the placement of insurance  claims administration  consulting services and other business transactions arising in the ordinary course of business 
where appropriate  we vigorously defend such claims  lawsuits and proceedings 
some of these matters seek damages  including consequential  exemplary or punitive damages  in amounts that could  if awarded  be significant 
we continually evaluate the likelihood on any adverse development to theses matters and their potential impact on our financial statements 
there can be no assurance  however  that the actual outcomes will be consistent with our evaluations 
on the basis of current information  we do not expect the outcome of the claims  lawsuits and proceedings to which we are subject to  either individually  or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of any such matters 
most of the claims  lawsuits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered by errors and omissions insurance or other appropriate insurance 
in terms of deductibles associated with such insurance  we have established provisions against these items  which we believe to be adequate in light of current information and legal advice 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of subsidiaries acquired 
as required by sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill and  at least annually  we test all existing goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach  on a reporting unit basis 
we test for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment to goodwill 
we carry goodwill on two reporting units within the agency operations segment in the amount of million and three reporting units within the specialty risk management operations segment in the amount of million 
based on our most recent evaluation of goodwill impairment  we determined that no impairment to goodwill exists 
results of operations executive overview during  we continued to experience an improved earnings pattern 
our underwriting results strengthened as a result of the controlled growth in earned premium in profitable programs 
our net income for  demonstrates our commitment to continued underwriting discipline  our focus on growing our profitable specialty and fee for service programs  rate increases  and our on going plan to leverage fixed costs 
in addition  we continued to achieve operational efficiencies and enhancements 
as a result  our generally accepted accounting principles gaap combined ratio improved percentage points to in from in 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued in  we raised million from the issuance of senior debentures  in addition to the million we raised in from the issuance of junior subordinated debentures 
since raising capital in and the issuance of the debentures  we have continued to remain focused on a systematic deployment of proceeds from theses transactions with controlled growth of historically profitable underwriting programs 
our gross written premiums increased million  or in we continue to implement new programs  which have proven track records of profitability 
our net earned premium increased million as a result of new business 
as previously indicated  with the growth we are experiencing  we continue to leverage fixed costs and maximize statutory surplus and cash flows 
statutory surplus increased to million in  from million in in  we had positive cash flow from operations of million  compared to million in compared to results from operations improved million from a net income of million  or per diluted share  in to net income of million  or per diluted share  in this improvement reflects an improvement in underwriting results  which is the result of the controlled growth of earned premium in profitable programs written in  continued rate increases  growth in agency commission  control over expenses  and leveraging of fixed costs 
in addition  this improvement in net income reflects an after tax benefit of approximately million from the acceleration of revenue recognition  net of expenses  relating to the termination of a specific multi state claims run off contract 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase reflects a million  or  increase in net earned premiums 
the growth in net earned premiums primarily reflects the earning pattern of programs written in  which include the conversion of an existing west coast commercial transportation program to one of our insurance subsidiaries  the impact of a renewal rights contract for a select group of association endorsed workers compensation programs which had over twenty years of profitable underwriting experience  the implementation of an excess liability program for public entities with a twenty year profitable track record  the return of profitable programs  the impact of an overall rate increase achieved in  and an overall rate increase in  which consisted of in the workers compensation line of business and in all other lines of business combined 
this increase was partially offset by the anticipated reduction in managed fee revenue from two limited duration or closed end administrative services and claims contracts 
during  we accelerated the recognition of the deferred claim revenue related to a multi state claims run off service contract 
the acceleration of this revenue was a result of an earlier than anticipated termination of our obligation under the contract 
this contract was terminated by the liquidator during the third quarter of  after a liquidation order was entered against the entity for which we had serviced the claims 
at the time of termination  we had million of deferred revenue related to the claims contract 
the revenue had been paid to us pursuant to an agreed upon schedule 
however  in order to remain consistent with our historic claims handling pattern  we had previously adopted a more conservative revenue recognition pattern  therefore  resulting in the establishment of deferred revenue 
at the termination of the contract  pursuant to the contract terms  we are no longer obligated to handle the related claims 
the million of deferred revenue related to the claims contract  was fully recognized as of september  had the contract not been terminated  we would have received additional claims fee revenue for continued claims handling services 
of the million  approximately  was expected to be recognized within the fourth quarter of therefore  the pre tax favorable impact for in relation to the acceleration of the deferred claim revenue  net of related expenses  would have been approximately million 
refer to our revenue recognition accounting policy described in note summary of significant accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued compared to results from operations improved million from a net income of million  or per diluted share  in to net income of million  or per diluted share  in this improvement reflects the addition of new fee for service agreements  the absence of reserve strengthening on discontinued programs  and continued expense controls 
the new fee revenue and expense controls have allowed us to leverage our fixed costs 
this improvement in net income also reflects the impact of rate increases achieved in and of and  respectively 
specialty risk management operations the following table sets forth the revenues and results from operations for specialty risk management operations in thousands for the years ended december  revenue net earned premiums management fees claims fees loss control fees reinsurance placement investment income net realized gains total revenue pre tax income loss specialty risk management operations compared to revenues from specialty risk management operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in net earned premiums increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the comparable period in as previously mentioned  this increase primarily reflects the earning pattern resulting from the controlled growth of programs written in management fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in the decrease in management fees reflects an anticipated shift in fee for service revenue previously generated from a third party contract to internally generated fee revenue that is eliminated upon consolidation 
the transition of such fees is directly related to the previously mentioned renewal rights contract 
excluding revenue generated from the third party contract  management fee revenue increased approximately million in comparison to this increase is primarily the result of higher premium volumes for specific programs in nebraska  minnesota  and new england  which is the basis for the calculation of fee for service revenue 
claim fees decreased million  or  to million  from million for the comparable period in this decrease reflects a similar anticipated shifting of revenue previously generated from the multi state claims run off service contract  to internally generated fee revenue that is eliminated upon consolidation 
the transition of such fees is directly related to the previously mentioned renewal rights 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued contract 
offsetting this anticipated reduction is the previously mentioned million in deferred revenue recognized during the third quarter of related to the multi state claims run off service contract 
excluding revenue previously generated from this contract and the revenue recognized due to the termination of this contract  claim fee revenue increased  in comparison to this increase is primarily the result of growth in claims handling revenue in new england 
net investment income increased million  or  to million in  from million in average invested assets increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase in average invested assets reflects cash flows from underwriting activities and growth in gross written premiums during and  as well as  net proceeds from capital raised through the issuance of debentures 
the average investment yield for was  compared to in the current pre tax book yield was and current after tax book yield was 
the decline in investment yield reflects the accelerated prepayment speeds in mortgage backed securities and the reinvestment of cash flows in municipal bonds and other securities with lower interest rates 
over the past two years  the reinvestment of cash flows has shifted from maturing securities with higher yields being replaced by securities with lower yields in a declining interest rate environment 
in addition  the decline in investment yield reflects the timing of investing the proceeds from the capital raised in specialty risk management operations generated pre tax income of million for the year ended december   compared to pre tax income of million for the comparable period in this increase in pre tax income demonstrates the improvement in underwriting results and the further leveraging of fixed costs as we continue to experience controlled growth of premium volume 
in addition  this improvement in pre tax income reflects an approximate million pre tax favorable impact in relation to the previously mentioned acceleration of deferred claim revenue  net of related expenses  relating to the termination of a specific multi state claims run off contract 
the gaap combined ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for the comparable period in net losses and lae increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in our loss and lae ratio decreased percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the same period in this ratio is the unconsolidated net loss and lae in relation to net earned premium 
the improvement in the loss and lae ratio reflects the impact of earned premium on profitable programs from the controlled growth in programs with profitable underwriting experience  the impact of rate increases in and  and to a lesser extent  a reduction in reinsurance costs 
these improvements were partially offset by the effect of a commutation of the and surplus relief reinsurance agreement and a reclassification between losses and expenses on one inactive program 
the impact of these settlements resulted in an increase to the loss and lae ratio of percentage points and a corresponding percentage point decrease to the gaap expense ratio 
the loss ratio reflects an increase in net ultimates of million  of which million is from the previously mentioned commutation and reclassification 
the remaining million  or of million  is from a small number of old claims in an isolated group of programs 
our expense ratio improved percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the same period in this ratio is the unconsolidated policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses in relation to net earned premium 
as mentioned above  the commutation and the reclassification had a favorable impact of percentage points 
partially offsetting this favorable impact was the anticipated increase in gross outside commissions 
this is a result of a shift in the balance between workers compensation and general liability 
the general liability line of business has a higher commission rate and a lower loss ratio 
compared to revenues from specialty risk management operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued net earned premiums increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the comparable period in this increase reflects net earned premiums from new business written in of million 
this includes million of net earned premium from the conversion of existing business into an insured program within the one of our underwriting subsidiaries 
the increase in net earned premiums is also the result of growth in existing business of million primarily related to rate increases 
offsetting the increase in net earned premiums is a million reduction in net earned premium related to programs discontinued in and programs terminated for leverage ratio purposes 
management fees increased million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in this increase in management fees reflects revenue from new fee for service agreements of million 
the remaining increase is the result of an overall net increase in management fees within our existing managed programs 
claim fees increased million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in this increase in claim fees reflects revenue from new fee for service agreements of million 
as anticipated  as this claims fee for service agreement expires  the related revenue will decrease 
this increase is partially offset by a decrease in discontinued programs and the impact of the conversion of an existing fee based program into an insured program within the one of our underwriting subsidiaries 
those fees are now intercompany fees and are eliminated upon consolidation 
loss control fees decreased  or  to million from million for the comparable period in this decrease is mainly the result of the previously mentioned conversion of an existing fee based program into an insured program within one of our underwriting subsidiaries 
net investment income decreased  or  to million in  from million in average invested assets increased million  or  to million in  from million in the average investment yield for was compared to in the current pre tax book yield was and current after tax book yield was 
the current pre tax reinvested yield was 
the decrease in investment yields reflects the accelerated prepayments in the mortgage backed securities  and reinvestment of cashflows in municipal bonds and other securities in an interest rate environment where interest rates are still relatively low compared with recent history 
the average increase in invested assets reflects million in proceeds from the public offering in june and cash flows from underwriting 
specialty risk management operations generated a pre tax income of million for the year ended december  compared to a pre tax loss of  for the comparable period in this improvement reflects the favorable impact of the previously indicated fee for service agreements and improved underwriting results 
the gaap combined ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for the comparable period in net losses and lae decreased  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in our loss and lae ratio decreased by percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the same period in this ratio is the unconsolidated net loss and lae in relation to net earned premium 
this improvement in the loss and lae ratio reflects continued disciplined underwriting and rate increases 
in addition  while we had adverse development of million  or of million of net loss and lae reserves at december   reserves continue to stabilize 
our expense ratio improved percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the same period in this ratio is the unconsolidated policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses in relation to net earned premium 
the improvement reflects a reduction in gross commissions and leveraging of fixed costs

other items reserves at december   our best estimate for the ultimate liability for loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  was million 
we established a reasonable range of reserves of approximately million to million 
this range was established primarily by considering the various indications derived from standard actuarial techniques and other appropriate reserve considerations 
the following table sets forth this range by line of business in thousands minimum maximum selected line of business reserve range reserve range reserves workers compensation commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other total net reserves includes residual markets 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued reserves are reviewed by internal and independent actuaries for adequacy on a quarterly basis 
when reviewing reserves  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of numerous factors such as per claim information  industry and our historical loss experience  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes in political attitudes  and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple factors 
the key assumptions used in our selection of ultimate reserves included the underlying actuarial methodologies  a review of current pricing and underwriting initiatives  an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels  and a detailed claims analysis with an emphasis on how aggressive claims handling may be impacting the paid and incurred loss data trends embedded in the traditional actuarial methods 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended december    and for the year ended december   we reported an increase in net ultimate loss estimates for accident years and prior of million  or of million of net loss and lae reserves at december  the increase in net ultimate loss estimates reflected revisions in the estimated reserves as a result of actual claims activity in calendar year that differed from the projected activity 
there were no significant changes in the key assumptions utilized in the analysis and calculations of our reserves during the major components of this change in ultimates are as follows reserves of deconsolidated incurred losses paid losses reserves at subsidiary at reserves at december  december  current prior total current prior total december  line of business year years incurred year years paid workers compensation residual markets commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other net reserves reinsurance recoverable consolidated

therefore  effective january   we deconsolidated american indemnity on a prospective basis in accordance with the provisions of fin r 
the adoption of fin r and the deconsolidation of american indemnity did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet or consolidated statement of income 
refer to recent accounting pronouncements of management s discussion and analysis 
workers compensation excluding residual markets the projected net ultimate loss estimate for the workers compensation line of business excluding residual markets increased million  or of net workers compensation reserves 
this increase reflects the result of a million and a  unfavorable impact related to the previously mentioned commutation of the and surplus relief reinsurance agreement and the reclassification between losses and expenses on one inactive program  respectively 
excluding the impact from the commutation and the reclassification  the net ultimate loss estimate for the workers compensation line of business  would have increased  or of net workers compensation reserves 
this net overall increase reflects an increase of million in accident year from higher than expected emergence of claim activity related to an alabama program  a florida program  a massachusetts program  and an inactive south carolina program 
in addition  there were net increases in the ultimate estimated losses for and of  and  respectively 
these increases reflect higher than expected claims activity 
in addition  there was a  increase in net ultimate loss estimates for driven by development on two cases within florida

we will use the revolving line of credit to meet short term working capital needs 
at december   we had an outstanding balance of million on the new revolving line of credit 
at december   we had an outstanding balance of million on our former term loan and no outstanding balance on our former revolving line of credit 
as part of the new loan agreement  we and certain of our non regulated subsidiaries pledged a continuing and unconditional first priority security interest in all of our property and named subsidiaries  excluding certain assets 
the revolving line of credit provides for interest at a variable rate based  at our option  upon either a prime based rate or libor based rate 
on prime based borrowings  the applicable margin ranges from to basis points below prime 
on libor based borrowings  the applicable margin ranges from to basis points above libor

our board of directors did not declare a dividend in or our board of directors considers whether a dividend will be declared based on a variety of factors  including but not limited to  our cash flow  liquidity needs  results of operations and financial condition 
as a holding company  the ability to pay cash dividends is partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries 
we did not receive any dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries in or a significant portion of our consolidated assets represent assets of our insurance company subsidiaries that at this time  without prior approval of the state of michigan office of financial and insurance services ofis  cannot be transferred to us in the form of dividends  loans or advances 
the restriction on the transferability to us from the insurance company subsidiaries is dictated by michigan insurance regulatory guidelines which  in general  are as follows the maximum discretionary dividend that may be declared  based on data from the preceding calendar year  is the greater of each insurance company s net income excluding realized capital gains or ten percent of the insurance company s surplus excluding unrealized gains 
these dividends are further limited by a clause in the michigan law that prohibits an insurer from declaring dividends except out of surplus earnings of the company 
earned surplus balances are calculated on a quarterly basis 
since star is the parent insurance company  its maximum dividend calculation represents the combined insurance company subsidiaries surplus 
based upon the statutory financial statements  star may only pay dividends to us during with the prior approval of ofis 
star s earned surplus position at december  was negative million 
no dividends were paid in or our insurance company subsidiaries are required to maintain certain deposits with regulatory authorities  which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively

the loss and loss adjustment expense payments do not have contractual maturity dates and the exact timing of payments cannot be predicted with certainty 
however  based upon historical payment patterns  we have included an estimate of our gross losses and loss adjustment expenses 
in addition  we have anticipated cash receipts on reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of million  of which we estimate that these payments to be paid for losses and loss adjustment expenses for the periods less than one year  one to three years  three to five years  and more than five years  to be million  million  million  and million  respectively  resulting in net losses and loss adjustment expenses of million  million  million  and million  respectively

our premium leverage ratios as of december   on a statutory consolidated basis  were to and to on a gross and net written premium basis  respectively 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted a risk based capital rbc formula to be applied to all property and casualty insurance companies 
the formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company s products and investment portfolio and is used as a tool to evaluate the capital of regulated companies 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in statutory capital and surplus for the purpose of initiating regulatory action 
in general  an insurance company must submit a report of its rbc formula to the insurance department of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year 
these laws require increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company s rbc declines 
the level of regulatory oversight ranges from requiring the insurance company to inform and obtain approval from the domiciliary insurance commissioner of a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its rbc to mandatory regulatory intervention 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued requiring an insurance company to be placed under regulatory control in a rehabilitation or liquidating proceeding 
the rbc model act provides for four different levels of regulatory attention depending on the ratio of the company s total adjusted capital  defined as the total of its statutory capital  surplus and asset valuation reserve  to its risk based capital 
the company action level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its risk based capital 
at the company action level  a company must submit a comprehensive plan to the regulatory authority that discusses proposed corrective actions to improve its capital position 
a company whose total adjusted capital is between and of its risk based capital is subject to a trend test 
a trend test calculates the greater of any decrease in the margin ie the amount in dollars by which a company s adjusted capital exceeds it risk based capital between the current year and the prior year and between the current year and the average of the past three years  and assumes that the decrease could occur again in the coming year 
if a similar decrease in margin in the coming year would result in a risk based capital ratio of less than  then company action level regulatory action would be triggered 
the regulatory action level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its risk based capital 
at the regulatory action level  the regulatory authority will perform a special examination of the company and issue an order specifying corrective actions that must be followed 
the authorized control level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its risk based capital  at which level the regulatory authority may take any action it deems necessary  including placing the company under regulatory control 
the mandatory control level  is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than of its risk based capital  at which level the regulatory authority is mandated to place the company under its control 
at december   all of our insurance company subsidiaries were in compliance with rbc requirements 
star reported statutory surplus of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the calculated rbc was million in and million in the threshold requiring the minimum regulatory involvement was million in and million in the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies twelve industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure from the usual values on four or more ratios generally leads to inquiries or possible further review from individual state insurance commissioners 

table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued in  our insurance company subsidiaries generated certain ratios that varied from the usual value range 
the variations and reasons for these variations are set forth below ratio usual range value company star change in net writings investment yield estimated current reserve deficiency to surplus under company savers two year overall operating ratio under company williamsburg investment yield company ameritrust investment yield two year reserve development to surplus under the increase in star s net written premium in reflected anticipated growth from premium rate increases  the conversion of existing controlled programs to our subsidiary s paper in and controlled growth related to select new business 
the decrease in the investment yield is the result of a substantial amount of principal payments on mortgage backed securities due to low interest rates and a strong mortgage refinance market in cash flows were reinvested in short and long term securities in an interest rate environment where interest rates are still relatively low 
also contributing to the decrease is a shift in investment strategy toward greater allocation to municipal bonds  which have lower yields than taxable bonds 
the estimated current reserve deficiency to surplus ratio measures the relationship between the current year s net premium earned to cumulative net unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
stated differently  this ratio compares balance sheet accounts loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for all years to an income statement account net earned premium for a single year 
this ratio implicitly assumes that there is a constant relationship between premiums earned and reserves  that there is a constant level of rate adequacy  that there is a constant mix of business  and there are consistent reinsurance terms 
as the naic iris instruction manual states  the results of this ratio can be distorted by significant changes in premium volume 
the unusual range reflects the impact of earned premium growth in star of which resulted from the reduction in premiums in and the subsequent controlled growth in and in addition  the cumulative rate increases since january were 
finally  the workers compensation reinsurance program over the past five years has changed with the termination of the and surplus relief treaty and increases in net retentions from a low of  per occurrence in to  in a more accurate reflection of the values intended to be derived in the formula would utilize a weighted average premium approach 
three different approaches  using weighted premiums with a split of current and prior premiums  weights based on current reserves by age  and weights based on percentages of reserves to ultimate incurred by age would result in a reduction of percentage points  percentage points  and percentage points  respectively  all of which are within the normal range 
the two year overall operating ratio on savers in was 
certain liability occurrence programs insured by savers experienced larger loss reserve development than historically realized 
the results of these programs have caused savers to re underwrite the programs as well as implement substantial rate increases 
these programs have historically been profitable for savers  and  although 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued there can be no guaranty  we believe the underwriting efforts and rate increases that have occurred will return these programs to profitability 
ameritrust s loss reserves from and prior accident years were impacted by two factors  both of which contributed to the increase in the two year reserve development to surplus ratio 
first  some large claims increased to amounts that would have been ceded to reliance insurance company 
a re evaluation of reinsurance recoveries was made due to reliance being placed into liquidation  the result of which was a write down of these ceded loss reserves 
the other factor impacting this ratio was reserve strengthening on claims incurred in older accident years that resulted from a claims audit performed during on june   am best upgraded our insurance company subsidiaries financial strength rating to a b very good with a positive outlook 
a positive outlook is placed on a company s rating if its financial and market trends are favorable  relative to its current rating level 
the upgrade reflects am best s positive assessment of our improved financial condition as a result of the issuance of new common shares and our debt reduction and indicates the potential for a near term upgrade 
we believe that as a result of our improved balance sheet and operating performance our rating will remain at least at its current level  if not at an upgraded level 
however  there can be no assurance that am best will not change its rating of our insurance company subsidiaries in the future 
reinsurance considerations we seek to manage the risk exposure of our insurance company subsidiaries and our clients through the purchase of excess of loss and quota share reinsurance 
our reinsurance requirements are analyzed on a specific program basis to determine the appropriate retention levels and reinsurance coverage limits 
we secure this reinsurance based on the availability  cost  and benefits of various reinsurance alternatives 
reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of risks assumed under insurance policies it issues  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
therefore  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers 
in our selection of reinsurers  we evaluate the financial stability of our prospective reinsurers 
to date  we have not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting reinsurance recoverables other than those balances related to connecticut surety company csc and hih america compensation liability company hih in  as well as  reliance national indemnity company reliance  for which allowances have been established 
no assurance can be given regarding the future ability of any of our reinsurers to meet their obligations

management s discussion and analysis continued or letters of credit 
at december   we had risk exposure in excess of collateral in the amount of million  compared to million at december   on these programs  of which we had an allowance of million at december   compared to million at december   related to these exposures 
we have historically maintained an allowance for the potential uncollectibility of certain reinsurance balances due from some risk sharing partners  some of which are in litigation 
at the end of each quarter  an analysis of these exposures is conducted to determine the potential exposure to uncollectibility 
at december   we believe this allowance is adequate 
to date  we have not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting balances from our risk sharing partners 
no assurance can be given  however  regarding the future ability of any of our risk sharing partners to meet their obligations 
at december  and  the exposure amount in litigation with former risk sharing partners  which is not reserved or collateralized  is million and million  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements on june   we entered into a guaranty agreement with a bank 
we are guaranteeing payment of a million term loan issued by the bank to an unaffiliated insurance agency 
in the event of default on the term loan by the insurance agency  we are obligated to pay any outstanding principal up to a maximum of million  as well as any accrued interest on the loan  and any costs incurred by the bank in the collection process 
in exchange for our guaranty  the president and member of the insurance agency pledged of the common shares of two other insurance agencies that he wholly owns 
in the event of default on the term loan by the insurance agency  we have the right to sell any or all of the pledged insurance agencies common shares and use the proceeds from the sale to recover any amounts paid under the guaranty agreement 
any excess proceeds would be paid to the shareholder 
as of december   no liability has been recorded with respect to our obligations under the guaranty agreement  since no premium exists in excess of the guaranteed amount 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial accounting standards board interpretation number fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
the primary objective of fin no 
is to provide guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights  such entities are known as variable interest entities 
fin no 
requires variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities and expands disclosure requirements for both variable interest entities that are consolidated as well as those within which an enterprise holds a significant variable interest 
in accordance with fin  we performed an evaluation of our business relationships and determined that meadowbrook capital trust i trust is a variable interest entity  however  the trust did not meet the qualifications for consolidation as the trust equity was deemed to not be at risk 
the adoption of fin no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet and had no impact on our consolidated statement of income 
refer to note debt for additional information regarding the unconsolidated subsidiary trust 
in december  fin no 
was revised as fin no 
r to address certain implementation issues and to defer full adoption into financial statements for periods ending after march   with earlier adoption permitted 
in accordance with fin no 
r  we performed an evaluation of our business relationships and determined that our wholly owned subsidiary  american indemnity  did not meet the tests for consolidation  because neither us  nor star are the primary beneficiaries of american indemnity 
therefore  effective january   we deconsolidated american indemnity on a prospective basis in accordance with the provisions of fin no

management s discussion and analysis continued in november  fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf issue requires that when the fair value of an investment security is less than its carrying value  an impairment exists for which the determination must be made as to whether the impairment is other than temporary 
eitf issue applies to all investment securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and to investment securities accounted for under the cost method to the extent an impairment indicator exists 
under the guidance  the determination of whether an impairment is other than temporary and therefore would result in a recognized loss depends on market conditions and management s intent and ability to hold the securities with unrealized losses for a period sufficient for recovery of such losses 
in september  fasb approved fasb staff position fsp eitf issue  which delays the effective date for measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs of eitf until certain issues are resolved 
the delay of the recognition and measurement provisions is expected to be superceded concurrently with the issuance of a fsp  which will provide additional implementation guidance 
we will evaluate the impact this guidance will have on our financial statements and will adopt the guidance at the time it is issued 
we have previously implemented the disclosure requirements of eitf on december   fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas  no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
starting in the first quarter of  we have been expensing the fair value of all stock options granted since january  under the prospective method 
under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r for all unvested stock options and restricted stock based upon the previously disclosed sfas methodology and amounts 
the retroactive methods would record compensation expense beginning with the first period restated for all unvested stock options and restricted stock 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas r and have not yet determined the method of adoption or impact sfas r will have on our financial statements 
related party transactions at december  and  respectively  we held an  and  note receivable  including  of accrued interest at december   from one of our executive officers

the note bears interest equal to our borrowing rate and is due on demand any time after january  the loan is partially collateralized by  shares of our common stock under a stock pledge agreement 
for the years ended december  and   and  respectively  have been paid against the loan 
as of december   the cumulative amount that has been paid against this loan was  on june   the officer and us entered into an employment agreement which provides the note is a non recourse loan and our sole legal remedy in the event of a default is the right to reclaim the shares pledged under the stock pledge agreement

on december   we entered into a development agreement with an unaffiliated third party for the construction of our new corporate headquarters 
the developer used a real estate consulting firm whose

this firm was paid approximately  by the developer  for its consulting work during the construction of the new building 
on december   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with an unaffiliated third party for the sale of acres of land located adjacent to our new headquarters 
in connection with this transaction  we executed an exclusive sale lease agency agreement agreement with the same real estate consultant  whereby will serve as the real estate broker for the sale of the land 
under the agreement  the real estate consultant will be paid a five percent commission approximately  of the sales price 
the sale price is approximately million 
in july  we entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party to sell our property at east th street  cerritos  california 
refer to note sale leaseback transaction for further information regarding this transaction 
the real estate consulting firm described above was also used for this transaction 
this firm received total commissions of  in relation to this transaction 
in addition  the real estate consultant was paid a total of  in for real estate consulting services relating to the relocation and leasing of our montgomery  alabama and grand rapids  michigan offices 
the amounts paid to the above mentioned real estate consultant related to these transactions were reviewed and approved by the finance and governance and nominating committees  as well as the board of directors and are commensurate with current market prices for such services 
subsequent events we relocated to our new headquarters on december   under a temporary certificate of occupancy 
we had a due diligence period of thirty days in which we had the ability to identify and have the developer resolve any conditions or defects that required adjustments prior to settlement 
we closed on january   with a cash settlement of million 
accordingly  we recorded the building and a corresponding accrued liability as of december  total depreciation expense during is expected to increase approximately  in addition  related other administrative expenses are expected to increase approximately  these increases will be offset by a decrease in other administrative expenses as a result of the expiration of the former corporate headquarters lease 
risk factors if our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are not adequate  we will have to increase our reserves  which would result in reductions in net income and retained earnings 
we establish reserves for losses and expenses related to the adjustment of losses under the insurance policies we write 
we determine the amount of these reserves based on our best estimate and judgment of the losses and costs we will incur on existing insurance policies 
our insurance company subsidiaries obtain an annual statement of opinion from an independent actuary firm on these reserves 
while we believe that our reserves are adequate  we base these reserves on assumptions about past and future events 
the following factors could have a substantial impact on our future loss experience the amounts of claims settlements  legislative activity  and changes in inflation and economic conditions 
actual losses and the costs we incur related to the adjustment of losses under insurance policies may be different from the amount of reserves we establish 
when we increase reserves  our net income for the period will decrease by a corresponding amount

management s discussion and analysis continued our performance is dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel 
the success of our business is dependent on our ability to retain and motivate our senior management and key management personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we have existing employment agreements with some of our executive officers 
we maintain key person life insurance policies on our key personnel 
our future success also will depend on our ability to attract  train  motive and retain other highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing  and customer service personnel 
competition for these employees is intense and we may not be able to successfully attract  integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
in addition  our future success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate our agents 
our failure to attract and retain the necessary personnel and agents could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
if market conditions cause our reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable  we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 
as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for significant amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries  especially for the excess of loss and severity risks 
market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase  which may affect the level of our business and profitability 
our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal 
we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or to obtain other reinsurance in adequate amounts and at favorable rates 
if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance  either our net exposure to risk would increase or  if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net risk exposures  we would have to reduce the amount of risk we underwrite 
we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion  if at all  and  as a result  we could experience losses 
we transfer some of the risk we have assumed to reinsurance companies in exchange for a portion of the premium we receive in connection with the risk 
although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred  it does not relieve us of our original liability to the policyholders 
our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables they owe us or they may not pay on a timely basis 
if our reinsurers fail to pay us or fail to pay us on a timely basis  our financial results could be adversely affected 
our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors  including cyclical changes in the insurance industry 
the results of companies in the property and casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties 
our industry s profitability can be affected by rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products  volatile and unpredictable developments  including man made  weather related and other natural catastrophes or terrorist attacks  changes in loss reserves resulting from the general claims and legal environments as different types of claims arise and judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurer s liability develop  
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued fluctuations in interest rates  inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment  which affect returns on invested assets and may impact the ultimate payout of losses  and increase in medical costs 
the demand for property and casualty insurance can also vary significantly  rising as the overall level of economic activity increases and falling as that activity decreases 
the property and casualty insurance industry historically is cyclical in nature 
these fluctuations in demand and competition could produce underwriting results that would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we face competitive pressures in our business that could cause demand for our products to fall and adversely affect our profitability 
we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business 
we compete  and will continue to compete  with major united states  foreign  and other regional insurers  as well as mutual companies  specialty insurance companies  underwriting agencies  and diversified financial services companies 
many of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
our profitability could be adversely affected if we lose business to competitors offering similar or better products at or below our prices 
in addition  a number of new  proposed or potential legislative or industry developments could further increase competition in our industry 
new competition from these developments could cause the demand for our products to fall  which could adversely affect our profitability 
a number of new  proposed or potential legislative or industry developments could further increase competition in our industry 
these developments include the enactment of the gramm leach bliley act of which permits financial services companies such as banks and brokerage firms to engage in the insurance business  which could result in increased competition from new entrants to our markets  the formation of new insurers and an influx of new capital in the marketplace as existing companies attempt to expand their business as a result of better pricing and or terms  programs in which state sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage  and changing practices created by the internet  which has increased competition within the insurance business 
these developments could make the property and casualty insurance marketplace more competitive by increasing the supply of insurance capacity 
in that event  recent favorable industry trends could be reversed and may negatively influence our ability to maintain or increase rates 
accordingly  these developments could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because we are heavily regulated by the states in which we operate  we may be limited in the way we operate 
we are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we operate 
the supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of our business and financial condition 
the primary purpose of the supervision and regulation is to maintain compliance with insurance regulations  protect policyholders and not our shareholders 
the extent of regulation varies  but generally is governed by state statutes 
these statutes 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative authority to state insurance departments 
this system of regulation covers  among other things standards of solvency  including risk based capital measurements  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  restrictions on the types of terms that we can include in the insurance policies we offer  required methods of accounting  reserves for unearned premiums  losses and other purposes  and potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain insurance policies provided by impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies 
the regulations of the state insurance departments may affect the cost or demand for our products and may impede us from obtaining rate increases or taking other actions we might wish to take to increase our profitability 
furthermore  we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority s interpretation of the laws and regulations 
also  regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant  renew or revoke licenses and approvals 
if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could stop or temporarily suspend us from conducting some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us 
we could be forced to sell investments to meet our liquidity requirements 
we believe that we maintain adequate amounts of cash and short term investments to pay claims  and do not expect to have to sell securities prematurely for such purposes 
we may  however  decide to sell securities as a result of changes in interest rates  credit quality  the rate or repayment or other similar factors 
a significant increase in market interest rates could result in a situation in which we are required to sell securities at depressed prices to fund payments to our insureds 
since we carry debt securities at fair value  we expect that these securities would be sold with no material impact on our net equity 
however  if these securities are sold  future net investment income may be reduced if we are unable to reinvest in securities with similar yields 
because our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income securities  our investment income could suffer as a result of fluctuations in interest rates 
we currently maintain and intend to continue to maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of fixed income securities 
the fair value of these securities fluctuates depending on changes in interest rates 
generally  the fair market value of these investments increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with changes in interest rates  while net investment income earned by us from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates 
changes in interest rates may result in fluctuations in the income derived from  and the valuation of  our fixed income investments  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers and the payment of claims by our clients captive  rent a captive  large deductible programs  indemnification agreements  and on the portion of risk exposure either ceded to the captives  or retained by our clients 
the inability of our risk sharing partners to meet their obligations could adversely affect our profitability 
our insurance company subsidiaries cede insurance to other insurers under pro rata and excess of loss contracts 
these reinsurance arrangements diversify our business and minimize our exposure to large losses or from hazards of an unusual nature 
the ceding of insurance does not discharge the original insurer from its 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued primary liability to its policyholder 
if all or any of the reinsuring companies are unable to meet their obligations  we would be liable for such defaulted amounts 
therefore  we are subject to a credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers 
in order to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies  we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor the economic characteristics of the reinsurers on an ongoing basis 
in addition  with our risk sharing programs  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the payment of claims by our clients captive  rent a captive  large deductible programs  indemnification agreements  and on the portion of risk exposure either ceded to the captives  or retained by our clients 
the capitalization and credit worthiness of prospective risk sharing partners is one of the factors we consider upon entering into and renewing risk sharing programs 
generally  we collateralize balances due from our risk sharing partners through funds withheld trusts or letters of credit 
to date  we have not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting balances from our risk sharing partners 
no assurance can be given  however  regarding the future ability of any of our risk sharing partners to meet their obligations 
the inability of our risk sharing partners to meet their obligations could adversely affect our profitability 
provisions of the michigan business corporation act  our articles of incorporation and other corporate governing documents and the insurance laws of michigan  missouri  california  and florida may discourage takeover attempts 
the michigan business corporation act contains anti takeover provisions 
chapter a and b of the business corporation act apply to us and may have an anti takeover effect and may delay  defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in their best interest  including those attempts that might result in shareholders receiving a premium over market price for their shares 
our articles of incorporation allow the board of directors to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock with voting rights  preferences and other privileges as the board of directors may determine 
also  we have adopted a shareholder rights plan which if triggered would significantly dilute the stock ownership percentage of anyone who acquires more than fifteen percent of our shares without the approval of our board of directors 
the existence of our shareholder rights plan and the possible issuance of preferred shares could adversely affect the holders of our common stock and could prevent  delay or defer a change of control 
we are also subject to the laws of various states  such as michigan  missouri  california  and florida  governing insurance holding companies 
under these laws  a person generally must obtain the applicable insurance department s approval to acquire  directly or indirectly  five to ten percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of our insurance company subsidiaries 
an insurance department s determination of whether to approve an acquisition would be based on a variety of factors  including an evaluation of the acquiror s financial stability  the competence of its management  and whether competition in that state would be reduced 
these laws may prevent  delay or defer a change of control of us or our insurance company subsidiaries 
if our financial strength ratings are reduced  we may be adversely impacted 
insurance companies are subject to financial strength ratings produced by external rating agencies 
higher ratings generally indicate greater financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims 
ratings are assigned by rating agencies to insurers based upon factors they believe are important to policyholders 
ratings are not recommendations to buy  hold  or sell our securities 
our ability to write business is most influenced by our rating from am best 
am best ratings are designed to assess an insurer s financial strength and ability to meet continuing obligations to policyholders 
currently  our rating from am best is b very good  with a positive outlook 
a positive outlook is

management s discussion and analysis continued placed on a company s rating if its financial and market trends are favorable  relative to its current rating level 
we believe that as a result of our improved balance sheet and operating performance our rating will remain at least at its current level  if not at an upgraded level 
however  there can be no assurance that am best will not change its rating in the future 
a rating downgrade from am best could materially adversely affect the business we write and our results of operations 
most states assess our insurance company subsidiaries to provide funds for failing insurance companies and those assessments could be material 
our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to assessments in most states where we are licensed for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies 
maximum contributions required by law in any one year vary by state  and have historically been less than of annual premiums written 
we cannot predict with certainty the amount of future assessments 
significant assessments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates as well as other relevant market rate or price changes 
the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the underlying assets are traded directly influence market risk 
the following is a discussion of our primary risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of december  our market risk sensitive instruments are primarily related to fixed income securities  which are available for sale and not held for trading purposes 
interest rate risk is managed within the context of asset and liability management strategy where the target duration for the fixed income portfolio is based on the estimate of the liability duration and takes into consideration our surplus 
the investment policy guidelines provide for a fixed income portfolio duration of between three and five years 
at december   our fixed income portfolio had a modified duration of  compared to at december  at december  the fair value of our investment portfolio was million 
our market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with debt securities 
our exposure to equity price risk is not significant 
our investment philosophy is one of maximizing after tax earnings and has historically included significant investments in tax exempt bonds 
in  we emphasized taxable securities over tax exempt securities in order to maximize after tax income and the utilization of the net operating loss carryforward 
during and continuing in  we began to increase our holdings of tax exempt securities based on our return to profitability and our desire to maximize after tax investment income 
for our investment portfolio  there were no significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed compared to the year ended december  we do not anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect 
a sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values  or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period 
in our sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonable possible near term changes in those rates 
near term means a period of up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
in our sensitivity model  we use fair values to measure our potential loss of debt securities assuming an upward parallel shift in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair values 
the table below presents our

rates down bps rates unchanged rates up bps market value yield to maturity or call effective duration the other financial instruments  which include cash and cash equivalents  equity securities  premium receivables  reinsurance recoverables  line of credit and other assets and liabilities  when included in the sensitivity model  do not produce a material loss in fair values 
at december   our million of debentures are subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on these debentures is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at this level  a change in market rates would change interest expense by  at december   we had million of debentures outstanding 
at this level  a change in market rates would change interest expense by  in addition  our credit facility in which we can borrow up to million is subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on the credit facility is directly correlated to market interest rates
