these solutions are typically comprised of highly accurate optical and or motion control devices 
our solutions are often embedded in larger systems that depend on precise optical control for accurate operation of critical functions 
in addition to optical solutions  we distribute precision ball bearings used in a variety of industrial and commercial applications 
operating segments during  we modified our segment reporting by combining what were previously referred to as the aerospace and defense and commercial products groups into a new segment  optical systems 
this change reflects the increasing collaboration among our facilities in the development of products that serve both the aerospace and commercial markets 
our business is now organized into two groups optical systems group and distributed products group 
the optical systems group designs  manufactures and sells highly precise assemblies and components which are typically embedded in optical systems for both government and commercial applications 
the optical systems group plans to continue focusing on growth markets that require highly precise optical and related motion control solutions 
these markets include homeland security initiatives  unmanned vehicle applications  the national missile defense market  new weapons platforms  and performance commercial markets 
an example of a target commercial market is the material processing business  where we are offering a potentially innovative technology called a fast steering mirror that has the opportunity to displace existing galvanometer technology in laser positioning applications 
the optical systems group has design and manufacturing facilities in san diego  california  cullman  alabama  rochester hills  michigan  and north billerica  massachusetts 
the distributed products group distributes precision ball bearings  spherical plain bearings  and bushings  acquired from various domestic and international sources  to oem s and maintenance repair organizations mros 
additionally  the distributed products group designs  manufactures and sells mechanical bearing subassemblies for a variety of customers 
the distributed products group is comprised of the ast bearings division located in montville  new jersey  with a satellite distribution center in irvine  california 
significant customers raytheon company raytheon  an aerospace and defense systems supplier  represented of our net sales in and in during  we did not have a concentration of sales with any one customer 
while raytheon  a prime contractor with the us government  does constitute a significant portion of our business  we do not currently believe that this is at risk business 
backlog and orders axsys recognized in bookings in excess of million  ending the year with record backlog of million  of which will be shipped beyond months 
as we look forward  we expect continued growth in the optical systems group  which is supported by the segment s backlog of million at the end of this group will continue to target orders that require highly precise optical and motion control solutions 
examples include surveillance  military navigation and targeting  smart weapons  and medical imaging 
acquisition of telic optics  inc on april  the closing date  axsys acquired all of the stock of telic optics  inc telic  a privately owned manufacturer of infrared optical products 
the financial results of telic are included in our optical systems group  since the date of acquisition 
telic s broad infrared optics capabilities increase our product offerings and complement our strong position in reflective optical solutions 
in addition  telic s products are typically used in ground and sea based programs 
this complements our historical focus on air and space based programs and expands our overall market and program penetration 
finally  the complementary addition of telic s technical capabilities to our core technical strengths is expected to increase our competitive advantage by broadening our technical offering to prime contractors who are seeking to outsource the fulfillment of their optical requirements 
the initial purchase price of this acquisition was million with an additional earn out of up to million over the months following the closing date based on certain revenue goals 
if revenue goals are achieved  the earn out will increase the amount of goodwill on our balance sheet and the total purchase price could reach million 
in addition  thousand of legal  audit and other acquisition related expenses were paid during axsys funded the initial cash portion of the purchase price and associated transaction costs through a combination of existing cash balances and outside bank financing 
included in axsys full year financial results were million of revenues  million of gross profit and million of operating income from the operations of telic 
james webb space telescope during  axsys received an million definitive contract from ball aerospace and technology corporation to produce the optical mirror substrates for the james webb space telescope jwst 
the contract contains million of production revenues and million for facilitization 
during  we recognized million of revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting related to the jwst project 
the jwst  which is due to launch in  will replace the hubble as nasa s premier space telescope 
northrop grumman is the prime contractor 
the primary mirror is comprised of individual lightweight beryllium segments  all of which will be fabricated by axsys 
because of the large size of the primary mirror  jwst will be significantly more sensitive than ground based infrared telescopes  enabling it to search for the first stars and galaxies formed in the universe billions of years ago 
axsys contract includes the production of optical substrates for an engineering development unit  primary mirror segments and support structures 
we expect to complete the engineering development unit in the first quarter of  with delivery of all segments by the end of divestitures during  axsys decided to exit the automation market and focus on our other businesses 
as part of this decision  we sold three of our business units our wholly owned subsidiary teletrac  inc teletrac  our wholly owned subsidiary automation engineering  inc aei and our fiber automation division fad 
we sold the stock of teletrac  which serves the data storage business  in exchange for an interest bearing thousand note  which provides for payments equal to ten percent of the revenues generated from the teletrac business with the balance  if any  due in five years 
because of the uncertain market conditions for data storage products and the terms of the note  axsys has reserved the entire value of this note and will record any principal and interest payments as ordinary income during the period received 
as a result of this sale  an asset impairment and cost of sale charge of million has been included in axsys consolidated statement of operations 
under applicable accounting principles  teletrac has not been treated as a discontinued operation and results of operations through the date of sale in are recognized in continuing operations 
revenues applicable to the data storage business were thousand in as a result of the sale  we closed our santa barbara manufacturing facility and relocated our micro positioning stage  laser interferometer and autofocus product lines to our facility located in rochester hills  michigan during the second quarter of the total pre tax cost of million associated with the relocation and facility closure included a charge of thousand for thirty terminated employees and a charge of thousand for the disposal of excess furniture and fixtures 
a charge of thousand was incurred as a result of the write off of certain inventory related to the termination of certain minor product lines 
other costs of thousand associated with the relocation included costs for the equipment relocation  employee training and recruitment and facility upgrades in michigan  which were expensed as incurred 
the sale of stock of aei and the sale of the net assets of fad have been accounted for as discontinued operations and the related net assets and operating results have been reported separately from continuing operations in all years presented 
revenues applicable to these discontinued operations were million in results of segment operations the following tables and discussion set forth selected financial information from continuing operations on a segment basis for the years ended december    and the segment tables  shown below  exclude one time charges  which are shown separately 
optical systems group segment table in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  sales cost of sales gross profit sales in the optical systems group segment increased for the year ended december  compared to  while sales in this segment increased for the year ended december  compared to our revenues included million of sales from our acquisition of telic 
telic s capabilities enhance our product offerings to include sophisticated infrared optical solutions used in sea and ground based defense applications 
we have also experienced significant growth in sales of our motion control solutions and beryllium structures  both of which are used in a variety of highly precise targeting  surveillance and missile defense system platforms 
during  we recognized million of revenues from the jwst contract under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
in addition  sales of our airbearing scanners  which are used in medical imaging applications  increased during gross profit as a percent of sales for the year ended december  increased compared to and mainly due to increased volume  sales mix and improved efficiencies in comparison to the past two years 
in addition  the acquisition of telic  which generally earns higher margins  contributed to our continued growth in gross profit for the optical systems group  as of december   had a backlog of definitive orders of million  of which is expected to ship beyond the fiscal year 
distributed products group segment table in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  sales cost of sales gross profit sales in the distributed products group increased for the year ended december  in relation to and as a result of increased revenues primarily in the industrial automation and consumer goods markets as well as a general increase in new customer activity across multiple markets 
gross profit as a percent of sales increased in compared to the prior two years primarily as a result of production efficiencies  higher sales volume and favorable product mix 
one time charges included in cost of sales non allocated table in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  one time charges during  we recognized a one time charge of thousand for the elimination of some small product lines resulting from the closure of the california facility 
operating expenses table in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses research  development and engineering expenses restructuring and special charges credits selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were million in compared to million in and million in telic incurred thousand of sg a in payments for incentives were higher in compared to the prior two years as a result of increased production 
in addition  we spent more on advertising during than in the prior two years as we attended more trade shows during the year  and we incurred additional compensation expense of thousand as a result of the termination of an executive officer and the modification of stock option grants under the terms of the severance agreement 
research  development and engineering expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses in increased thousand compared to primarily due to increased efforts on a variety of projects developed to increase our sales in space and commercial markets 
restructuring and special charges 
during the second quarter of  we reversed a thousand reserve associated with product lines that were either discontinued or sold during there were no restructuring and special charges in compared to million in during  restructuring charges included thousand for termination expenses incurred in connection with the termination of our chief operating officer as a result of a segment realignment and the subsequent disposal of the automation group  million associated with asset write downs and severance expenses resulting from the sale of teletrac and thousand of costs relating to the relocation of some commercial oem product lines from santa barbara  california to rochester hills  michigan 
other income and expenses interest expense 
interest expense was thousand in the year ended december   compared to thousand in and thousand in the increase in expense in compared to is primarily due to interest on our million loan  taken in conjunction with the acquisition of telic  which was partially offset by lower interest paid on capital leases compared to interest income 
interest income was thousand in the year ended december  compared to thousand in and thousand in interest income is primarily composed of income from cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition  we received thousand in and thousand in in interest income from a note receivable from the sale of sensor systems  which was paid in full during the fourth quarter of other income and expense  net 
net other expense in was thousand compared to net other income of thousand in and thousand in currently  other income and expenses is composed of the effects of foreign exchange transactions partially offset by a return of a legal escrow 
we had recovered thousand in and thousand in from a fully reserved note from the sales of sensor systems 
this note was paid in full during the fourth quarter of during  we recognized a charge of thousand for the disposal of fixed assets 
income taxes 
the consolidated effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to in and in the effective rate for each year was impacted by the creation and utilization of a valuation allowance 
in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we established a million valuation allowance against our deferred income tax asset in as we reported income  we reduced the valuation allowance and utilized million in and million in as deferred income tax assets were realized 
available and prudent tax planning strategies support the deferred income tax asset on the books at december  for  we expect the consolidated effective income tax rate of axsys to be approximately 
the effective income tax rate reflects the provisions in the american jobs creation act of  which phase out the deduction for export sales and creates a new deduction for us production activities 
discontinued operations 
during  we incurred an additional charge of thousand  net of taxes of thousand  related to the divestiture of our automation group 
in  we believed that we would be able to sublease two facilities formerly occupied by our divested businesses 
however  we have not been able to locate tenants for these facilities 
these leases will expire in and the additional charge is sufficient to cover the remaining lease obligations 
in addition  during we recognized a charge of thousand  net of taxes of thousand  for an environmental related expense for previously divested operations 
we completed the disposal of the automation group in the fourth quarter of the sale of the automation group resulted in a loss of million  net of taxes of million  which included thousand for the impairment of assets and thousand of closing related expenses 
in addition  the operating loss from these facilities  which is also included in discontinued operations  was million  net of taxes of million  in the remainder of the loss from discontinued operations in included a thousand charge  net of taxes of thousand  for an environmental related expense for a previously divested operation  which was partially offset by thousand of income  net of taxes of thousand from the reversal of unutilized reserves primarily associated with the sale of the beau interconnect division in net income loss 
we had net income of million in  net income of million in and a net loss of million in included in the million net income for is a loss from discontinued operations of thousand as a result of the discontinuation of our automation group and charges incurred for environmental related expenses 
during  we sold our automation group  which resulted in a net loss of million including both operating losses and a loss on the sale 
in addition  we recognized an income tax provision of million from continuing operations  which was primarily the result of the establishment of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred income tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources we fund our operations primarily from cash on hand and cash flow from operations 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
during and  we maintained a high level of liquidity as evidenced by our current ratio  which was as of december  and as of december  this strategy was necessary as we restructured axsys and discontinued unprofitable businesses 
with this process complete  we began to seek growth opportunities 
to that end  we completed the acquisition of telic on april  and as a result our current ratio decreased to as of december  axsys funded the initial cash portion of the purchase price and associated transaction costs through a combination of existing cash balances and outside financing 
in connection with the transaction  axsys arranged a million credit facility with bank of america  which included a million acquisition related  five year term loan and a million  two year revolving line of credit that may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
as of december   we had not drawn on the revolving line of credit 
net cash provided by operations was million in  million in and million in in  our primary sources of operating cash were million of net income plus non cash expenses  which primarily consists of million of depreciation and amortization 
these non cash charges were partially offset by non cash benefits  including a million increase in our net deferred income tax asset  due to the utilization and reversal of a valuation allowance for these assets 
we also paid out thousand for liabilities related to discontinued operations  which was offset by an additional accrual for discontinued operations of thousand 
in  we utilized million of cash to fund changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
we used million of cash to fund an increase in our accounts receivable  which resulted from sales growth and higher deferred income billings in our optical solutions group 
we also utilized million to fund inventory growth in the inventory growth was related to certain large long term programs in our optical systems group 
the increases in accounts receivable and inventory were partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in deferred income 
the increase in deferred income was the result of our strategy to actively negotiate progress payments into certain large dollar contracts for long lead time products and long term programs 
this strategy helps to mitigate the near term negative cash impact of these contracts 
the net change in accrued expenses and other liabilities and other long term liabilities was a thousand increase 
the increase was related to increased accruals for compensation related expenses and an accrual for capital equipment that was received but not invoiced  which were partially offset by the liquidation of an inactive pension plan and the utilization of the reserve for loss contracts 
during  we also received a thousand federal income tax refund 
in  our primary sources of operating cash were million of net income  million of depreciation and a million federal income tax refund 
the income tax refund was partially offset by a thousand income tax receivable that was recognized in one of our primary uses of cash was inventory  which grew million in the inventory growth was related to certain large programs in our optical systems group 
the cash outflows for inventory were almost entirely offset by a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in deferred income 
in  we reduced accrued expenses and other liabilities and long term liabilities by thousand 
this was primarily due to the utilization of reserves for loss contracts and restructuring 
in addition  we utilized million to fund obligations related to our discontinued operations 
in  axsys net loss of million included the following non cash items a million deferred income tax valuation allowance  which was partially offset by a million increase in our deferred income tax asset  million of depreciation  thousand of losses on capital asset disposals and thousand non cash restructuring and special charges 
we also received a million federal income tax refund 
the impact of the refund was partially offset by an income tax receivable for million  which was booked in but not received until during  we collected million in deferred income for our beryllium based products  which was partially offset by a million increase in inventories for these products 
trade accounts payable declined by million largely due to the timing of inventory receipts in the fourth quarter 
in  accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased thousand primarily due to payments for state income taxes  and our cost reduction plan 
during  net cash provided by discontinued operations was million  which was primarily an increase in accrued liabilities and an asset impairment charge taken as a result of the sale of the automation group 
during  discontinued operations  including the loss on sale  from the automation group generated net losses of million 
in addition  during  we paid thousand in expenses related to the remediation of environmental sites located at former facilities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and thousand in in  we utilized million to acquire telic our new subsidiary 
the purchase of telic was partially funded by the sale of million of short term investment securities 
capital expenditures were million in  or million more than in the additional capital was used to construct a  square foot  climate controlled manufacturing facility in cullman  al 
the additional space is being used to produce the beryllium mirror substrates and support structures for an engineering development unit  optical mirror segments and two spare units and support structures that comprise the meter primary mirror as well as the secondary mirror for jwst 
during  we invested million in short term investment securities 
the funds were invested in short term investment securities in order to minimize interest rate risk and to allow for rapid redeployment when profitable long term investment or expansion opportunities were identified 
in  we also invested million in capital equipment 
in  we invested million in capital equipment  net of thousand of capital lease proceeds  and we received thousand in net proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations 
in  we expect to spend between and million on capital equipment 
the majority of this capital investment will be used to purchase production and testing equipment  which will expand our capacity and improve our efficiency 
we also plan to use some of these funds to renovate and expand our recently acquired facility in north billerica  massachusetts 
we anticipate spending additional funds to replace the information technology platform in our san diego  california facility 
currently  we are evaluating various information technology systems and the costs and benefits of potentially rolling the new system out to additional facilities 
as a result  we are unable to estimate the cost or timing of the information technology platform investment at this time 
financing activities provided million of cash in and used million of cash in and thousand of cash in during  we obtained a million term loan for the acquisition of telic and received thousand in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
these sources of funds were partially offset by repayments of thousand on the term loan and thousand on our capital leases 
in and  funds were used to repay capital leases 
in  we utilized thousand to retire five of our capital leases with the highest interest rates before their maturity date 
the prepayment penalties on these leases had expired  which enabled us to achieve a modest interest savings 
our remaining capital leases contain prepayment penalties  which decline each year on the anniversary date of their funding 
as the penalties decline  management may decide to prepay some or all of the remaining leases 
during  we paid thousand to settle litigation regarding our preferred stock  which was liquidated in as of december   total debt  which consisted of a term loan and capital leases  was million 
total debt as a percentage of total capitalization total debt and shareholders equity was at december  and at december  given our high level of liquidity  low leverage  positive cash flow from operations and strong relationship with our primary bank  management believes that  if necessary  we will be able to obtain significant amounts of financing on favorable terms  so that we will be able to continue to profitably expand the business 
shareholder s equity was million  or per common share outstanding  at december  compared to million  or per share  at december  the increase in shareholders equity was due primarily to net income of million 
most of the remaining increase in shareholders equity was related to the exercise of stock options and stock option compensation 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated single purpose entities 
contracts and commitments axsys has entered into certain contractual obligations  which will result in material cash outlays over the next several years 
a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for capital leases  minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year to years to years after years notes payable capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total as of december   axsys had operating lease commitments for all of our facilities  with the exception of our cullman  alabama facility  which is owned 
in addition  our operating lease commitments included leases on some office equipment 
as of december   axsys has various purchase obligations  which include long distance phone service  atm lines and other commitments 
we did not include cellular phone service commitments  as we determined the obligation to be minimal 
incorporated in other long term obligations are commitments related to environmental remediation plans and building leases associated with discontinued operations 
axsys is involved in the various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites 
the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of cleanup  the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods 
as of december   axsys determined that it was probable that it would incur approximately thousand of remedial costs  of which thousand is included in current liabilities and thousand is in other long term liabilities 
during  axsys disposed of the automation group  which included facilities in wilmington  massachusetts wilmington and pittsburgh  pennsylvania pittsburgh 
as part of the terms of the sale  we remain obligated under the operating leases for these facilities 
both leases expire in and we anticipate our remaining commitment to be thousand 
since  we have been sub leasing a small portion of our wilmington facility  however  given the uncertainties regarding the real estate market in both of these regions  we do not believe that we will be able to locate a sublease tenant for the pittsburgh facility nor be able to sublease the entire wilmington facility at our contractual rates 
therefore  we have fully reserved for our remaining lease commitments for both facilities and any remaining costs associated with these sites will not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
it is possible  however  that our results of operations for a particular fiscal period could be materially affected 
as of december   we were contingently liable for thousand under outstanding letters of credit 
we have issued letters of credit for certain business transactions including insurance programs and building lease security deposits 
as of december   we had one pension plan for which benefits and participation have been frozen 
pension benefits under this plan are generally based upon years of service and compensation 
the plan is an unfunded plan with an annual payout of approximately thousand 
backlog a substantial portion of our business is of a build to order nature requiring various engineering  manufacturing  testing and other processes to be performed prior to shipment 
as a result  a significant portion of our annual sales is in our backlog of orders at the beginning of the year 
our backlog of orders increased by or million  to million at december  from million at december  we believe that a substantial portion of our backlog of orders at december  will be shipped over the next twelve months 
however  approximately of our current backlog will be shipped in and beyond 
the majority of our longer term backlog consists of firm contracts with prime contractors of the united states government for our beryllium machined products 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to inventory allowances  contingencies  bad debts  warranties  environmental remediation efforts and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical data  when available  experience  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to inventory valuation and the adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts  long term loss contract reserves and environmental contingencies 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition 
we manufacture or distribute products  which are either components or subassemblies that are sold to other manufacturers or oems 
we do not sell any finished products directly to consumers 
therefore  we are generally not responsible for any installation or customer training 
however  some of our contracts are subject to customer acceptance and generally the customer will inspect and accept the product at our facility prior to shipment 
generally  legal title passes to the customer upon shipment 
however  occasionally product is shipped fob destination 
when the product is shipped fob destination  revenues are not recognized until the customer receives the product 
our policy is to recognize revenues when product is either shipped to or received by the customer 
however  certain long term contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion model 
incurred costs and estimated gross profits are recognized as sales as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs using our estimates of costs and contract value 
cost estimates include direct and indirect costs such as labor  materials and overhead 
these contracts require judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
contract change orders are included when they can be reasonably estimated and realization is probable 
we may receive progress payments that exceed costs incurred on these long term contracts 
such advances are recognized as billings in excess of costs and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred income primarily results from the advance billings to our customers for the cost of beryllium  known as material only billings 
these material only billings are deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue only when the associated finished product is shipped 
due to the build to order nature of our products  except for the distribution of ball bearings  we do not offer price protection and generally do not offer discounts 
to the extent discounts are offered  they are reflected at the time of the sale as a reduction in revenues 
the price is fixed upon acceptance of the purchase order 
when customer change orders occur  any pricing changes are reflected in revised purchase orders 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we periodically review the aging of our accounts receivable over ninety days to identify potentially uncollectible accounts and establish reserves based on experience and discussion with customers 
actual write offs could differ from our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if circumstances change  ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customers ability to meet our financial obligations our estimates of recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on current requirements and historical usage 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess or obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  some of our markets are characterized by rapid technological change or frequent new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory 
in the future  if we determine our inventory to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize those costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
loss contract reserves 
generally  our customer contracts are completed within one year of receiving the order 
however  occasionally longer lead time orders are received and we monitor these contracts periodically to determine whether our actual costs are comparable to our cost estimates used at the time of order acceptance 
if we determine that our actual costs are significantly exceeding our original estimates  we will record a loss contract reserve 
currently  one contract is covered by a loss contract reserve 
we accrued for this contract based on the contract price and the current cost structure  including estimated cost increases 
to the extent future manufacturing costs ie  labor rates and material costs change  our loss contract reserves will be impacted 
environmental contingencies 
we are currently involved in several environmental remediation projects 
we accrue for environmental contingencies when responsibility for cleanup is determined and costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
when costs are not probable and can be reasonably estimated  no accrual is made 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside environmental consultants handling these matters and are based upon an analysis of the anticipated remediation plans 
we do not anticipate these projects will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 
self insurance we are self insured for certain losses related to general liability  workers compensation and medical claims 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is established based on an analysis of historical data and is reviewed by management on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
while we believe that our estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity and frequency of claims  medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums  differ from our estimates  our results from operations could be impacted 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered  and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not more than likely  we are required to establish a valuation allowance 
if a valuation allowance is established or increased during any period  we are required to include this amount as an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operation 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recognized against net deferred assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of the taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or management adjusts these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised statement r  share based payment  which revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the revised statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions with employees and other third parties  eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb and requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
the revised statement is effective as of the first interim period beginning after june  axsys will adopt the statement on july  as required 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had axsys adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share in the stock based compensation accounting policy note included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges  and that fixed production overheads should be allocated to inventory based on normal capacity of production facilities 
this statement is effective for axsys fiscal year axsys is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our overall results of operations or financial position 
cautionary factors that may affect future results this filing contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including  without limitation  statements regarding our ability to reduce design and manufacturing lead times and manufacturing costs  our ability to integrate existing technologies  our ability to implement our strategy to develop and sell  among other things  higher level sub systems  the changes to be achieved from our cost reduction efforts  our objective to grow through strategic acquisitions and anticipated expenditures for environmental remediation 
one can identify these forward looking statements by the use of the words such as expect  anticipate  plan  may  will  estimate or other similar expressions 
discussion containing such forward looking statements is found in the material set forth under business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as within the filing generally 
one should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
these factors include those discussed below as well as inaccurate assumptions 
axsys cautions the reader  however  that this list of factors may not be exhaustive 
risk factors the following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this filing 
the aerospace and defense industry  which represents the majority of our sales  is largely dependent upon government contracts 
a significant portion of our business and business development efforts are concentrated in the aerospace and defense industry 
our business depends  in significant part  upon the us government s continued demand in the area of defense for high end  high performance products of the type that we manufacture 
approximately of our net sales in  of net sales in and in were derived directly from contracts with the us government  or its agencies or departments  or indirectly from subcontracts with us government contractors 
the majority of these government contracts are subject to termination and renegotiation 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially affected by changes in us government expenditures for defense 
in addition  we cannot assure you that current and future government programs will continue to use our products 
we currently have one customer that represents a significant portion of our accounts receivable balance 
as of december   raytheon corporation  an aerospace and defense systems supplier  accounted for of our outstanding accounts receivable 
as of december  and  no individual customer represented more than of our accounts receivable balance 
credit is extended to customers typically on net day terms with periodic reviews of the aging of accounts receivable to identify potentially uncollectible accounts 
we do not require collateral 
we act as a subcontractor for many different government programs 
the funding of government programs is subject to congressional appropriations 
although multi year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements  congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years 
consequently  programs are often only partially funded initially  and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations 
the termination of funding for a government program would result in a loss of anticipated future revenues attributable to that program 
that could have a negative impact on our operations 
in addition  the termination of a program or failure to commit additional funds to a program already started could increase our overall costs of doing business 
generally  government contracts and subcontracts are subject to oversight audits by government representatives and contain provisions permitting termination  in whole or in part  without prior notice at the government s convenience upon the payment of compensation only for work done and commitments made at the time of termination 
we can give no assurance that one or more of our government contracts or subcontracts will not be terminated under these circumstances 
also  we can give no assurance that we would be able to procure new government contracts or subcontracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of any termination of our contracts 
as our revenues are dependent on our procurement  performance and payment under our contracts  the loss of one or more critical contracts could have a negative impact on our financial condition 
our government business is also subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of socio economic and other requirements 
these requirements  although customary in government contracts  increase our performance and compliance costs 
these costs might increase in the future  reducing our margins  which could have a negative effect on our financial condition 
failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or debarment  for cause  from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 
among the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes  including those related to procurement integrity export control government security regulations employment practices protection of the environment  and accuracy of records and the recording of costs the termination of a government contract or relationship as a result of any of these acts would have a negative impact on our operations and could have a negative effect on our reputation and ability to procure other government contracts in the future 
licenses are required from government agencies under the arms export control act of for export of our products 
we can give no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining these necessary licenses in order to conduct business abroad 
certain employees are required to hold and maintain security clearances with the department of defense and or the department of energy 
these clearances are required as we may have access to classified documents 
we can give no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining these necessary clearances in order to conduct business with the us government 
our operating results may vary substantially due to factors that are difficult to forecast 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by axsys or our competitors  domestic and foreign general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the industries that we serve could cause substantial variations in our operating results 
the defense  aerospace  semiconductor capital equipment  high performance graphic art  medical imaging capital equipment  industrial automation oem and mro markets  each of which represents a significant market for our products  have historically been subject to substantial economic fluctuations due to changing demands for their products and services  introduction of new products and product obsolescence 
any future fluctuations arising from these or other conditions could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results due to a variety of factors  including market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products timing and shipment of significant orders mix of products sold length of sales cycles plant openings and closings the timing of acquisitions or dispositions delays in raw materials shipments  as well as other manufacturing delays and disruptions completion of large projects the level of backlog of orders domestic and foreign general economic conditions  and demand in the markets that we serve 
to some extent  primarily in our bearing distribution division  our net sales and operating results for a specific quarter will depend upon generating orders to be shipped in the same quarter in which the order is received 
the failure to receive anticipated orders or delays in shipments near the end of a particular quarter  due  for example  to unanticipated rescheduling or cancellations of shipments by our customers or unexpected manufacturing difficulties  may cause our net sales in a particular quarter to fall significantly below expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations for such quarter 
the rapid pace of technological change will require continuous new product development 
our success will continue to depend in substantial part upon our ability to introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards and to apply appropriate levels of engineering  research and development resources necessary to keep pace with these developments 
in addition  our success will depend on how well we respond to changes in customer requirements and achieve market acceptance for our products and capabilities 
any failure by axsys to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in order to develop new products successfully  we are dependent upon close relationships with our customers and their willingness to share proprietary information about their requirements and participate in collaborative efforts with us 
we cannot assure you that our customers will continue to provide us with timely access to information or that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products and services or their enhancements 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the new products and services or their enhancements  if any  that we develop  will achieve market acceptance 
our markets are extremely competitive 
we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to design and engineer our products to meet performance specifications set by our customers  most of whom are oems who purchase component parts or sub systems for inclusion in their end products 
product pricing and quality  customer support  experience  reputation and financial stability are also important competitive factors 
there are a limited number of competitors in each of the markets for the various types of precision optical and positioning products that we sell 
our competitors  especially those in the precision optical and positioning product lines  are typically focused on a smaller number of product offerings than we are  and they are often well entrenched 
some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do 
our competitors could develop enhancements to or future generations of competitive products that will offer superior price or performance features to ours 
in addition  new processes or technologies could emerge that render our products less competitive or obsolete 
in addition  a substantial investment is required by an existing or potential customer to integrate components and sub systems into their product design 
we believe that once a customer has selected particular components or sub systems from one vendor  the customer generally relies upon that vendor to provide equipment for the specific product application and may seek to rely upon that vendor to meet other component or sub system requirements 
accordingly  axsys may be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to a prospective customer that chooses to utilize a competitor s components or sub systems 
further  there are numerous competitors in markets to which we distribute precision ball bearings 
our competitors  who vary in size  include other ball bearings distributors as well as ball bearing manufacturers 
the basis of competition in the industries in which we compete could shift and we may not be able to compete successfully 
our levels of international sales and purchases could pose risks to our operating results 
our international sales from continuing operations accounted for approximately of net sales in  in  and in in addition  our products are sold to domestic customers who use them in products that they sell into international markets 
also  we purchase a substantial portion of our ball bearing products from two foreign suppliers and certain other products from other foreign suppliers 
our international sales and purchases are subject to a number of risks generally associated with international operations  including general economic conditions  import and export duties and restrictions  currency fluctuations  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability and potentially adverse income tax consequences 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully manage acquisitions 
as part of our business development strategy  we plan to pursue acquisitions in order to expand our product offerings  add to or enhance our base of technical and sales personnel or provide desirable customer relationships 
this growth could result in a significant strain on our managerial  financial  engineering and other resources 
the rate of our future expansion  if any  in combination with the complexity of the technologies involved in our businesses  may demand an unusually high level of managerial effectiveness in anticipating  planning  coordinating and meeting our operational needs as well as the needs of our customers 
we may not successfully acquire the most complementary businesses 
axsys cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire complementary businesses on a cost effective basis  integrate acquired operations into our organization effectively  retain and motivate key personnel  or retain customers of acquired firms 
we compete for attractive acquisition candidates with other companies or investors  and that competition could increase the cost of pursuing our acquisition strategy or reduce the number of attractive candidates to be acquired 
axsys reviews and considers possible acquisitions on an on going basis 
many key product components come from single source suppliers 
a significant portion of our precision machining business depends on the adequate supply of specialty metals  such as beryllium  at competitive prices and on reasonable terms 
we currently procure all of our beryllium from brush wellman  the sole us supplier  and expect to continue to rely on brush wellman for beryllium for the foreseeable future 
although we have not experienced significant problems with our supplier in the past  we cannot assure you that such relationship will continue or that we will continue to obtain such supplies at cost levels that would not adversely affect our gross margins 
the partial or complete loss of brush wellman as a supplier of beryllium  or production shortfalls or interruptions that otherwise impair our supply of beryllium  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
it is uncertain whether alternative sources of supply could be developed without a material disruption in our ability to provide beryllium products to our customers 
although we have not experienced significant problems with our other suppliers in the past  we cannot assure you that such relationships will continue or that  in the event of the termination of one or more of our relationships with those other suppliers  we would be able to obtain alternative sources of supply without a material disruption in our ability to provide products to our customers 
in addition  we purchase a substantial amount of the ball bearings that we distribute from two foreign suppliers 
any material disruption in our supply of products would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our future success depends on our ability to retain key personnel 
axsys success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our key executive officers and senior management personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of these individuals may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on our executive officers 
in addition  since our continued success is largely dependent upon our ability to design  manufacture and sell high performance solutions for the high performance technology market  we are particularly dependent upon our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified technical personnel  including engineers and skilled machinists  with the requisite educational background and industry experience 
our employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time  and competition for personnel is intense 
accordingly  we cannot assure that we will be successful in retaining our existing personnel 
the loss of the services of a significant number of our technical or skilled personnel  or the future inability to attract technical or skilled personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must protect our intellectual property rights 
the patents of competitors could impact our business 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies will depend  in part  on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology 
we rely upon a combination of patents  trademarks and trade secrets  non disclosure agreements and other forms of intellectual property protection to safeguard our proprietary technology 
we cannot assure you as to the degree of protection offered by these patents 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or that our non disclosure agreements will provide meaningful protection of our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
competitors in the united states and foreign countries  many of which have substantially greater resources than we do and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may have applied for or obtained  or may in the future apply for and obtain  patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make and sell some of our products 
although we believe that our existing products do not infringe on the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  third parties could assert infringement claims against us and such claims could be successful 
we must comply with strict environmental regulations  both compliance and non compliance could result in material liabilities or costs 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our engineering  research and development and manufacturing activities 
failure to comply with applicable environmental requirements could result in substantial liability to axsys  suspension or cessation of our operations  restrictions on our ability to expand our operations or requirements for the acquisition of additional equipment or other significant expense  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you a that changes in federal  state or local laws  regulations or regulatory policy  or the discovery of unknown problems or conditions  will not in the future require substantial expenditures  or b as to the extent of our liabilities  if any  for past failures  if any  to comply with applicable environmental laws  regulations and permits  any of which also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have made and continue to make investments in protective equipment  process controls  manufacturing procedures and training in order to minimize the risks to our employees  surrounding communities and the environment due to the presence and handling of hazardous materials 
the failure to properly handle these materials could lead to harmful exposure for employees or to the discharge of certain hazardous waste materials 
since axsys does not carry environmental impairment insurance  such a failure could lead to a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  environmental problems could develop in the future which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must continue to invest significant resources to maintain and upgrade our manufacturing capabilities 
we have invested  and intend to continue to invest  in state of the art equipment in order to increase  expand  update or relocate our manufacturing capabilities and facilities 
changes in technology or sales growth beyond currently established manufacturing capabilities would require that we make further investment 
we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient funds from operations to finance any required investment or that other sources of funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  any further expansion could negatively impact our business  financial condition or results and operations 
one shareholder controls a significant block of axsys stock and this concentration could affect important operating decisions 
the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of axsys owns approximately of the outstanding common stock as of december  as a result  he will have the ability to exert influence with respect to corporate actions  including the election of directors and certain sales or mergers and acquisitions 
our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate substantially 
the price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations 
that price volatility may be attributable  at least in part  to the limited number of shares generally available for sale in the public market 
in addition  factors  such as  actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our financial results  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products or services and the timing of announcements of acquisitions or dispositions by axsys or our competitors  as well as conditions in our markets generally  may have a significant adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  the stock market historically has experienced volatility which has particularly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies and which sometimes has been unrelated to the operating performances of such companies 
certain anti takeover provisions could cause harm to our shareholders 
our certificate of incorporation  as amended the certificate of incorporation  our by laws the by laws and the delaware general corporation law dgcl contain various provisions which could delay or impede the removal of incumbent directors and could make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving axsys more difficult  even if such a transaction would be beneficial to the interests of the shareholders  or could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of axsys 
we have authorized  shares of our preferred stock  none of which is currently outstanding  and which we could issue without further shareholder approval and upon terms and conditions  and having rights  privileges and preferences  as the board of directors may determine 
we have no current plans to issue any preferred stock 
the by laws include provisions establishing advance notice procedures with respect to shareholder proposals and director nominations  and permitting the calling of special shareholder meetings only by the written consent of three quarters of the board of directors or the chairman of the board 
the certificate of incorporation provides that in lieu of a meeting  action may be taken by written consent of our shareholders only by unanimous consent 
these provisions could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of axsys  and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of holders of common stock 
in addition  we are subject to section of the dgcl  which  among other things and subject to various exceptions  restricts certain business transactions between a corporation and a shareholder owning or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock an interested shareholder for a period of three years from the date the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of axsys without action by the shareholders and  therefore  could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
in the event of a change of control of axsys  the vesting of outstanding options issued under our long term stock incentive plan may be accelerated at the discretion of the committee administering the plan or may be required to be accelerated under certain circumstances provided for in incentive agreements 
absence of cash dividends on common stock 
axsys does not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future
