item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on december   congoleum and two of its subsidiaries each filed their respective voluntary petitions commencing cases for reorganization relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in order to resolve congoleum s asbestos related liabilities pursuant to a pre packaged chapter plan of reorganization filed in the congoleum chapter cases 
during  congoleum obtained the requisite votes of asbestos personal injury claimants necessary to seek approval of the proposed  pre packaged chapter plan of reorganization 
in january  the company filed its proposed plan of reorganization and disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court 
on november   congoleum filed a modified plan of reorganization and related documents with the bankruptcy court reflecting the result of further negotiations with representatives of the asbestos claimants committee  the future claimants representative and other asbestos claimant representatives 
the bankruptcy court approved the disclosure statement and plan voting procedures on december  and has scheduled a hearing beginning april  to consider confirmation of the plan 
congoleum currently expects that the confirmation hearings will transpire over a number of months 
congoleum has solicited and received the acceptances necessary for confirmation of its plan 
however  there can be no assurance that the confirmation hearing will not be rescheduled to a later date  that the proposed plan of reorganization will not be modified further  that the bankruptcy court will confirm and approve the plan  or that the proposed plan  if confirmed  will become effective 
congoleum is presently involved in litigation with certain insurance carriers related to disputed insurance coverage for asbestos related liabilities  and certain insurance carriers filed various objections to congoleum s previously proposed plan of reorganization and related matters 
it is expected that these or other insurance carriers will file objections to confirmation of the recently filed modified plan of reorganization 
other parties have also filed or may file various objections to confirmation of congoleum s plan of reorganization 
in anticipation of congoleum s commencement of the chapter cases  congoleum entered into a settlement agreement with various asbestos personal injury claimants the claimant agreement  which provides for an aggregate settlement value of at least million 
as contemplated by the claimant agreement  congoleum also entered into agreements establishing a pre petition trust the collateral trust to distribute funds in accordance with the terms of the claimant agreement and granting the collateral trust a security interest in its rights under applicable insurance coverage and payments from insurers for asbestos claims 
under congoleum s proposed plan of reorganization  after the establishment of the trust to be established pursuant to the provisions of section g of the united states bankruptcy code upon confirmation of the plan of reorganization the plan trust  the assets in the collateral trust would be transferred to the plan trust 
the company expects that any claims subject to the claimant agreement that are unsatisfied as of the confirmation of the plan of reorganization by the bankruptcy court would be channeled to the plan trust 
based on its proposed plan of reorganization  congoleum has made provisions in its financial statements for the minimum amount of the range of estimates for its contribution and costs to effect the proposed plan to settle asbestos liabilities through a plan trust established pursuant to the provisions of section g of the bankruptcy code 
congoleum recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of  an additional million in the fourth quarter of  and a further million in the fourth quarter of to provide for the estimated minimum costs of completing its reorganization 
abi also recorded approximately million for costs abi expects to incur in thousand and for its anticipated contribution to the plan trust thousand in connection with congoleum s reorganization plan 
actual amounts that will be contributed to the plan trust by congoleum and costs for pursuing and implementing the plan of reorganization could be materially higher  and congoleum and the company may record significant additional charges should the minimum estimated cost increase 
in addition  abi is also a defendant in a number of asbestos related lawsuits in addition to those brought against congoleum 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  which is incorporated herein by reference 
these matters could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
during  the company decided to discontinue the operations of its janus flooring corporation subsidiary  a manufacturer of pre finished hardwood flooring  and sell the related assets 
results of janus flooring  including charges resulting from the shutdown  are being reported as a discontinued operation 
due to congoleum s bankruptcy and separate capital structure  the company believes that presenting abi and its non debtor subsidiaries separately from congoleum is the most meaningful way to discuss and analyze its financial condition and results of operations

canadian segment sales increased as a result of foreign currency translation  and higher industrial product sales offset lower flooring sales 
jewelry segment sales were essentially level as decreased sales to the mass merchandiser channel and lower service revenues were offset by growth with department stores  and specialty and mid tier retailers 
gross profit was of net sales in compared to in gross margins in the tape segment declined point as a percentage of net sales due to higher raw material costs 
canadian segment margins improved points as a percentage of net sales as improved manufacturing performance and spending reductions more than offset higher raw material costs 
margins in the jewelry business improved points as a percentage of net sales on a more profitable customer mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  up from million in  as a result of higher employee benefit costs  freight and selling expense increases 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses declined from of net sales in to of net sales in net interest expense increased from million in to million in due to higher interest rates under certain of the company s debt agreements 
the effective tax rate in of arises primarily from combining profitable segments providing for taxes at higher statutory rates with unprofitable segments whose resulting tax benefits are at lower statutory rates 
furthermore  the canadian division recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets arising from its losses 
future effective tax rates are expected to be closer to statutory rates  but could fluctuate widely depending on the actual and relative results of individual segments  as well as other factors 
the loss from continuing operations was thousand in  compared with thousand in  as improved income from operations was offset by higher interest and taxes and less favorable net foreign exchange gains losses 
the net loss was million in compared with a net loss of million in when the charges related to the closure of the janus flooring operations were recognized 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million or from sales of million in jewelry segment sales decreased million or from due to lower sales to a major mass merchandiser  partly offset by increases in sales to other customers 
tape and canadian segment sales increased slightly as a result of foreign currency translation  absent the weaker us dollar  these segments would have reported decreases due to the continued weak economic environment in several of their end use markets 
gross profit was of net sales in compared with in gross margins in the tape segment  as a percentage of its net sales  improved percentage points due to a more profitable product mix  the weaker dollar  and manufacturing cost improvements 
canadian margins declined percentage points as a percentage of net sales principally due to lower volume 
margins in the jewelry business were the same in as in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net sales  up from million or of net sales in selling  general and administrative expenses increased due to higher costs for insurance  employee medical benefits and professional fees as well as the impact of the weaker us dollar on expenses of foreign operations 
net interest expense increased from million in to million in due to slightly higher average borrowings and higher interest rates under certain of the company s debt agreements 
the effective tax rate in was 
the high effective tax rate in relative to statutory rates was primarily the result of the fact that the canadian division recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets arising from its losses 
the loss from continuing operations was thousand in  compared with income from continuing operations of million in  as a result of the lower profitability of the jewelry business and the loss at the canadian division 
the net loss was million in compared with a net income of million in  or net income of million before a required accounting change 
the lower net income before the required accounting change versus income the previous year was due to the increased loss from discontinued operations in when the charges related to closure of janus flooring were recognized

the increase in sales resulted from improvements in residential sheet sales reflecting the introduction in the second half of of a new high end product  xclusive  continued improvements in sales of the duraceramic tile product  higher shipments to the manufactured housing industry  and the effect of a price increase 
partially offsetting these improvements were declines in do it yourself tile sales to mass merchandisers  lower durastone product sales and less demand for residential sheet specials 
gross profit for the year ended december  totaled million  or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales for the year ended december  the increase in gross margins was driven by improvement in product mix  particularly residential sheet  coupled with improved manufacturing efficiencies and the impact of cost reduction programs initiated in the second half of these factors helped offset sharply higher raw material costs experienced during the second half of the year 
the significant raw material inflation experienced in is expected to continue into and will reduce profit margins to the extent it cannot be recovered through price increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses for and included million and million  respectively  of costs associated with asbestos related reorganization claims 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the lower selling  general and administrative expenses reflect the impact of several cost savings initiatives instituted in the second half of  including workforce reductions  reduced merchandising and sampling expenses  and elimination of trade shows 
these initiatives  coupled with further cost reduction steps taken in the fall of  helped offset increased costs in healthcare  pensions and performance related incentive fees 
congoleum recorded a charge of million during the fourth quarter of  included in selling  general  and administrative expenses  to increase its estimated recorded liability for resolving asbestos related claims 
the recorded liability at december  represents the minimum estimated cost that congoleum would incur to resolve its asbestos related liability through the execution of congoleum s proposed plan of reorganization 
if congoleum is not successful in obtaining confirmation of its proposed plan of reorganization in a timely manner  actual costs could be significantly higher 
the proposed plan also would require congoleum to make an additional contribution to the plan trust one year after confirmation of the plan equal to of any increase in market value of congoleum s shares at that time over their value on june  for example  if the adjustment amount were calculated for the period ended december   the resulting adjustment amount would be million 
no provision has been made for the cost of this possible additional contribution  which could be material 
congoleum will adjust its recorded liability should its estimates change 
in addition  it is expected that the terms of the note will require congoleum to make interest payments prior to such note s maturity date 
income from operations was million for the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the same period in the prior year  an improvement of million 
this improvement in operating income reflects higher sales and margins coupled with reductions in operating expenses 
interest income was unchanged at million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense increased from million in to million in  primarily reflecting the accrued interest on unpaid senior note interest 
due to the chapter proceedings  congoleum was precluded from making the interest payments due february  and august  on the senior notes 
congoleum recorded a tax benefit of million on income before taxes of million in this relates primarily to anticipated tax benefits associated with certain prior year expenditures for resolving asbestos related liabilities  which congoleum has determined may be carried back but were not previously recognized 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease resulted primarily from lower sales in the do it yourself tile category coupled with continued weakness in the manufactured housing market 
improved resilient sheet volume  particularly in base grade and trade up builder products  coupled with a price increase and lower sales allowances  helped to partially mitigate the sales decline 
gross profit for the year ended december  totaled million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  gross margins improved slightly as improved pricing  manufacturing efficiencies and cost reduction programs helped offset raw material cost increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses for and included million and million of costs associated with asbestos related claims  respectively 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  cost savings initiatives were implemented that helped offset increases in pension  medical and other related costs 
congoleum recorded a charge of million during the fourth quarter of  included in selling  general  and administrative expenses  to increase its recorded liability for resolving asbestos related claims to the then estimated minimum cost to resolve its asbestos related liability through the execution of its proposed plan of reorganization 
the loss from operations was million for the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december   an improvement of million 
this smaller loss from operations was primarily due to the lower asbestos related charge  offset by lower gross margin dollars 
interest income declined from million in to million in due to lower average cash equivalent and short term investment balances 
interest expense increased from million in to million in  reflecting increased borrowings under congoleum s revolving credit agreement 
congoleum recorded a tax benefit of million on a loss before income taxes of million in as a result of utilizing certain loss carry forwards that had previously been fully reserved 
liquidity and capital resources abi and non debtor subsidiaries at december   working capital was million  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to  and the debt to equity ratio was to net cash provided by operations during was million 
although the company currently has no material commitments for capital expenditures  it plans to make capital expenditures during of approximately million to million 
capital expenditures generally cover normal replacement of machinery and equipment and process improvements 
cash requirements for capital expenditures  working capital  debt service  and any dividends or share repurchases are expected to be financed from operating activities and borrowings under existing lines of credit 
existing resources  together with cash generated from operations  is expected to be sufficient to meet capital requirements of current operations for the foreseeable future 
the company s debt agreements restrict the amount of capital expenditures that the company may make in particular periods to a specified aggregate amount 
american biltrite inc has two principal debt agreements that it is party to as borrower 
the first of those agreements is a credit agreement the credit facility with bank of america as successor to fleet national bank  bofa 
the credit facility provides the company with a revolving credit facility of up to million  including up to million for the issuance of letters of credit 
amounts that the company can borrow under the credit facility are subject to reduction from time to time if the borrowing base is less than million 
the formula used for determining the borrowing base formula is based upon inventory  receivables and fixed assets of the company and certain of its subsidiaries  reduced by amounts outstanding under the note agreement as defined below 
interest is payable on amounts borrowed under the credit facility at rates which generally vary between a libor based rate plus to a libor based rate plus depending on the company s leverage ratio  as determined under the credit facility 
certain domestic subsidiaries of the company have agreed to guarantee the company s obligations under the credit facility 
the credit facility expires on january  the second principal debt agreement that american biltrite inc is a party to the note agreement is with the prudential insurance company of america prudential 
under the note agreement  the company previously issued notes in an aggregate principal amount of million the series a notes 
the series a notes generally bear interest at a rate of per annum  and the company is obligated to pay prudential an additional fee on each interest payment date if the company s and certain of its subsidiaries ratio of debt to ebitda  as defined under the note agreement  exceeds certain levels 
the amount of those fees that may be payable by the company varies depending on the extent the company s and certain of its subsidiaries debt exceeds ebitda  as determined under the note agreement  and is capped at of the outstanding principal amount of the series a notes 
principal on the senior a notes is repayable in five annual installments of million beginning on august  in addition  the note agreement provides for possible issuances of additional notes by the company for up to an aggregate principal amount of million  which additional notes will mature not later than years after the date of issuance and will bear interest at rates to be determined on or about the time of issuance 
both the credit facility and the note agreement contain certain covenants that the company must satisfy 
the covenants included in the credit facility and the note agreement include certain financial tests  restrictions on the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness or to grant liens on its assets and restrictions on the ability of the company to pay dividends on its capital stock 
pursuant to the credit facility and the note agreement  the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries granted bofa and prudential a security interest in most of the company s and its domestic subsidiaries assets 
the security interest granted does not include the shares of capital stock of the company s majority owned subsidiary congoleum corporation or the assets of congoleum corporation 
in the past  the company has had to amend its debt agreements in order to avoid being in default of those agreements as a result of failing to satisfy certain financial covenants contained in those agreements 
most recently  in march  the note agreement was amended to revise certain financial covenants to afford the company greater flexibility to comply with those covenants  as well as to permit the company to undertake certain transactions 
the company is currently negotiating modifications to financial covenants for under the note agreement to make them comparable to the financial covenants in the amended credit facility 
while the company has been successful in such negotiations previously and believes it will be so again  failure to obtain such modifications or to obtain waivers of certain existing financial covenants would likely result in the company failing to satisfy the financial covenants as currently comprised during the measurement periods in such a failure would constitute a default under the note agreement 
there can be no assurance that the company will not need to obtain additional amendments or waivers of covenants under its debt agreements in or subsequent years 
if it fails to satisfy those covenants it will be in default under the respective debt agreements 
pursuant to the terms of the credit facility and the note agreement  a default by the company under one of those agreements triggers a cross default under the other agreement 
if a default occurs  bofa and prudential could respectively require the company to repay all amounts outstanding under the respective debt agreements 
if a default occurs and the company is unable to obtain a waiver from bofa and prudential and the company is required to repay all amounts outstanding under those agreements  the company would need to obtain funding from another source 
otherwise  the company would likely be unable to repay those outstanding amounts  in which case  bofa as administrative agent over the collateral securing the amounts outstanding under the credit facility and the note agreement  might exercise bofa s and prudential s rights over that collateral 
any default by the company under the credit facility or the note agreement that results in the company being required to immediately repay outstanding amounts under its debt agreements  and for which suitable replacement financing is not timely obtained  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
as noted above  the credit facility and the note agreement restrict the company s ability to obtain additional financing 
moreover  since the company and most of its subsidiaries have already granted security interests in most of their assets  the company s ability to obtain any additional debt financing may be limited 
the company currently believes that its cash flow from operations  expected proceeds from the sale of the janus flooring assets and borrowings available under its existing credit facilities will be adequate for its expected capital expenditure  working capital and debt service needs  subject to compliance with the covenants contained in its debt agreements and the ability of the company to replace or refinance its existing credit facility that is scheduled to expire on january  on satisfactory terms 
however  if circumstances change  the inability of the company to obtain any necessary additional debt financing would likely have a material adverse effect on its business  operations and financial condition 
under congoleum s anticipated plan of reorganization  it is expected that certain rights that the company may have to receive indemnification for claims under the plan of reorganization or the joint venture agreement relating to the contribution by abi to congoleum in of the company s tile division  subject to certain exceptions  will not be paid to the company for so long as any obligations owed to the plan trust under the promissory note expected to be contributed by congoleum to the plan trust remain outstanding 
instead  those amounts will be held in escrow by the plan trust and be pledged by the company as collateral securing congoleum s obligations under that promissory note until released from such escrow and paid to the company pursuant to the terms of congoleum s plan of reorganization  the promissory note and the pledge agreement expected to be entered into by the company with regard to the collateral expected to be pledged by the company to secure congoleum s obligations under the promissory note 
to the extent the amounts that are subject to that escrow are material  that could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and capital resources since those escrowed amounts represent amounts that would have already been paid by the company but not yet reimbursed to the company to the extent they remain in escrow 
pursuant to the terms of congoleum s plan of reorganization  abi will also pledge the shares of congoleum stock it owns as collateral securing congoleum s obligations under that promissory note expected to be contributed by congoleum to the plan trust 
the original principal amount of that note is expected to be million and will be subject to increase as of the last trading day of the consecutive trading day period commencing on the first anniversary of the effective date of congoleum s plan of reorganization in an amount equal to the excess  if any  of the amount by which of congoleum s market capitalization as of that date exceeds million 
this adjustment amount could result in the principal amount of the note increasing materially 
for example  if the adjustment amount were calculated based on the excess of of the equity value of congoleum over million during the consecutive day trading period ended december   the resulting adjustment amount would be million 
although the scheduled repayment date for this note does not occur until its tenth anniversary of issuance  it is expected that the terms of the note will require congoleum to make interest payments prior to the note s maturity date 
any default by congoleum under that note could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and capital resources 
the proposed congoleum plan of reorganization also provides for a possible additional contribution by abi to the plan trust in the event abi sells its interest in congoleum during the three year period beginning on the first anniversary of confirmation of congoleum s plan of reorganization 
the expected amount of any additional contribution by abi would be equal to of any amount by which of the equity value of congoleum implied by abi s sale of its interest in congoleum exceeds the aggregate principal amount of the note contributed by congoleum to the plan trust outstanding as of the measurement date for determining whether the principal amount of that note would be increased and after taking into account any such increase in the principal amount 
in addition  the terms of congoleum s plan of reorganization are expected to provide that the company will no longer have certain other rights to receive indemnification under the joint venture agreement or congoleum s plan of reorganization for asbestos related property damage claims 
to the extent that the company pays material amounts for asbestos related property damage claims that the company would have been entitled to be reimbursed for by congoleum absent the provisions of congoleum s plan of reorganization  that could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and capital resources 
furthermore  to the extent that the amount of any of the company s indemnity claims against the plan trust are reduced pursuant to the distribution procedures under congoleum s plan of reorganization to an amount less than the corresponding amount paid by the company  that could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  under the terms of congoleum s plan of reorganization  abi expects to contribute thousand in cash to the plan trust 
the company s canadian subsidiary has debt financing under an agreement with cibc the cibc agreement that provided a million canadian dollar us million at the december  foreign currency exchange rate capital loan and provides an operating loan facility of million canadian dollars us million at the december  foreign currency exchange rate 
proceeds of the capital loan were used to fund acquisitions of property and equipment in canada 
the capital loan is payable in equal quarterly installments which began on february  and bears interest at per annum 
the operating loan is payable on demand and bears interest at a floating rate which was per annum at december  borrowings under the cibc agreement are secured by the canadian division s inventory  receivables  and equipment 
at december   million was outstanding under the company s credit facilities and million secured outstanding letters of credit 
unused available borrowings under the company s credit facilities at december  were million based on collateral levels at that date 
the company has not declared a dividend subsequent to the second quarter of any future dividends will be determined by the company s board of directors based upon the financial performance and capital requirements of the company  among other considerations 
under the credit facility  aggregate dividend payments since september  are generally limited to of cumulative consolidated net income computed treating congoleum under the equity method of accounting  as determined under the credit facility  earned after september  under the note agreement  aggregate dividend payments since december  generally may not exceed the sum of million plus of cumulative consolidated net income accounting for congoleum under the equity method of accounting  as determined under the note agreement  earned after december  the following table summarizes the company s obligations at december  for future principal payments on its long term debt assuming any necessary amendments or waivers are obtained from its lenders  future minimum rental payments on its non cancelable operating leases and future minimum royalty and advertising payments for licensed brand names on k m products 
payments due by period in thousands of dollars and total thereafter long term debt        operating leases     royalty advertising commitments    on december  the company s subsidiary congoleum and two of its subsidiaries each filed voluntary petitions with the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey case no 
seeking relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
as part of congoleum s plan of reorganization  abi expects that congoleum s indemnification obligations to abi with respect to current and future asbestos claims related to its former tile division operations that are not covered by abi insurance will be channeled to the plan trust 
abi expects to contribute thousand in cash and pledge the shares of congoleum stock it owns as collateral securing the performance of congoleum s obligations under the promissory note expected to be issued by congoleum to the plan trust 
the company also estimates that it will incur approximately thousand in expenses during in connection with congoleum s planned reorganization 
abi does not expect its cash contribution  its pledge and expenses related to the reorganization will have a material adverse effect on its liquidity or capital resources 
the company is a defendant in a number of asbestos related lawsuits as well 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which is included at item these matters may have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources congoleum congoleum is a defendant in a large number of asbestos related lawsuits and on december  filed a pre packaged plan of reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code as part of its strategy to resolve this liability 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which are contained in item of this annual report on form k 
these matters will have a material adverse impact on liquidity and capital resources 
during  congoleum paid million in fees and expenses related to implementation of its planned reorganization under chapter and litigation with certain insurance companies 
pursuant to terms of the claimant agreement and related documents  congoleum is entitled to reimbursement for certain expenses it incurs for claims processing costs and expenses in connection with pursuit of insurance coverage 
at december   congoleum had million recorded as a receivable for such reimbursements 
the amount and timing of reimbursements that will be received will depend on when the trust receives funds from insurance settlements or other sources and whether the insurance proceeds exceed million  which is the required threshold for reimbursement of the first million spent by congoleum 
congoleum believes this threshold will be met  although there can be no assurances to that effect 
congoleum expects to spend a further million at a minimum in fees  expenses  and trust contributions in connection with obtaining confirmation of its plan  which amount is recorded in its reserve for asbestos related liabilities in addition to the million insurance settlement being held as restricted cash 
it also expects to spend a further million during in connection with pursuit of insurance coverage  for which it expects to be reimbursed as discussed above 
as part of congoleum s proposed plan of reorganization  congoleum will also issue a promissory note to the plan trust 
under the terms of the proposed plan  the original principal amount of congoleum s note will be million and will be subject to increase as of the last trading day of the consecutive trading day period commencing on the first anniversary of the effective date of congoleum s plan of reorganization in an amount equal to the excess  if any  of the amount by which of congoleum s market capitalization as of that date exceeds million 
this adjustment amount could result in the principal amount of the note increasing materially 
for example  if the adjustment amount were calculated for the period ended december   the resulting adjustment amount would be million 
although the scheduled repayment date for this note does not occur until its tenth anniversary of issuance  this debt may affect congoleum s ability to obtain other sources of financing or refinance existing obligations 
in addition  it is expected that the terms of the note will require congoleum to make interest payments prior to such note s maturity date 
the proposed plan and collateral trust agreement  as modified  would obligate congoleum  together with the plan trust  to indemnify certain asbestos claimant representatives for all costs and liabilities including attorneys fees relating to the negotiation of the modification of the plan and the collateral trust 
congoleum s indemnification obligations in this regard are capped under the modified plan and plan trust agreement at million 
in addition  the plan would further obligate congoleum to fund any actual costs in excess of million incurred by such asbestos claimant representatives in connection with the confirmation of the plan  subject to bankruptcy court approval of those costs 
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  including short term investments at december   were million  an increase of million from december  the increase includes accrued but unpaid interest during of million 
under the terms of its revolving credit agreement  payments on congoleum s accounts receivable are deposited in an account assigned by congoleum to its lender  and the funds in that account are used by the lender to pay down any loan balance 
funds deposited in this account but not yet applied to the loan balance  which amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively  are recorded as restricted cash 
additionally  a million settlement received in august from an insurance carrier  which is subject to the lien of the collateral trust  is included as restricted cash at december  congoleum expects to contribute these funds  less any amounts withheld pursuant to reimbursement arrangements  to the trust formed upon confirmation of its plan of reorganization 
working capital was million at december   up from million one year earlier 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december  was to  compared to to at december  the ratio of debt to total capital at december  was to compared to to at december  net cash provided by operations during the year ended december  was million  as compared to net cash used by operations of million in net cash from operations increased from to due to improved operating results  resumption of normal trade credit which had contracted at the end of  non payment of interest on congoleum s senior notes while operating under chapter  and improved inventory management 
capital expenditures in totaled million 
congoleum is currently planning capital expenditures of approximately million in and between million and million in  primarily for maintenance and improvement of plants and equipment  which it expects to fund with cash from operations and credit facilities 
in january  the bankruptcy court authorized entry of a final order approving congoleum s debtor in possession financing  which replaced its pre petition credit facility on substantially similar terms 
the debtor in possession financing agreement as amended and approved by the bankruptcy court to date provides a revolving credit facility expiring on june  with borrowings up to million 
interest is based on above the prime rate 
this financing agreement contains certain covenants  which include the maintenance of minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
it also includes restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt and limitations on capital expenditures 
the covenants and conditions under this financing agreement must be met in order for congoleum to borrow from the facility 
congoleum was in compliance with these covenants at december  borrowings under this facility are collateralized by inventory and receivables 
at december   based on the level of receivables and inventory  million was available under the facility  of which million was utilized for outstanding letters of credit and million was utilized by the revolving loan 
congoleum anticipates that its debtor in possession financing facility will be replaced with a revolving credit facility on substantially similar terms upon confirmation of its plan of reorganization 
while congoleum expects the facilities discussed above will provide it with sufficient liquidity  there can be no assurances that it will continue to be in compliance with the required covenants  that congoleum will be able to obtain a similar or sufficient facility upon exit from bankruptcy  or that the debtor in possession facility would be renewed if congoleum s plan of reorganization is not confirmed by that facility s expiration on june  in addition to the provision for asbestos litigation discussed previously  congoleum has also recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities other than asbestos related claims  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
congoleum is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against congoleum 
among these claims  congoleum is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites more fully discussed in legal proceedings in part i  item 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites and certain of congoleum s owned and previously owned facilities 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
the exact amount of such future cost and timing of payments are indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of congoleum s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties  and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
congoleum has recorded provisions in its financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known general and environmental contingencies 
while congoleum believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable  and that they will be paid over a period of five to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from congoleum s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on congoleum s costs  congoleum is not aware of any pending legislation which would reasonably have such an effect 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along to its customers 
estimated insurance recoveries related to these liabilities are reflected in other non current assets 
the outcome of these environmental matters could result in significant expenses incurred by or judgments assessed against congoleum 
congoleum s principal sources of capital are net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its financing agreement 
congoleum generated million in cash from operations in as more fully discussed above  which includes million of accrued but unpaid interest on long term debt 
congoleum believes these sources will be adequate to fund working capital requirements  debt service payments  planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future  and its current estimates for costs to settle and resolve its asbestos liabilities through its proposed chapter plan of reorganization 
congoleum s inability to obtain confirmation of the proposed plan of reorganization in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on congoleum s ability to fund its operating  investing and financing requirements 
the following table summarizes congoleum s contractual obligations for future principal payments on its debt and future minimum rental payments on its non cancelable operating leases at december  congoleum does not have payment obligations under capital leases or long term purchase contracts 
payments due by period in thousands of dollars and total thereafter long term debt   operating leases        contingencies abi has recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
while abi believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable and that they will be paid for the most part over a period of one to seven years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from abi s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on abi s costs  abi is not aware of any pending legislation which could significantly affect the liabilities abi has established for these matters 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along by abi to its customers 
certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against abi 
among these claims  abi is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites and asbestos related claims 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites 
the exact amount of such future costs to abi is indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of abi s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
abi has recorded provisions in its consolidated financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known environmental and asbestos related contingencies 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
during  the company decided to cease operations at its janus flooring division and recorded a charge of million in the second quarter consisting primarily of million to reduce inventories to net realizable value  million in accounts receivable allowances  a million asset impairment charge related to machinery and equipment and a million income tax provision to write off deferred tax assets deemed not probable of recovery 
the company disposed of substantially all of the assets of janus flooring  other than the real estate  during future expenditures related to this discontinued operation are not expected to be material  and the company expects to realize approximately million in net future cash proceeds from the sale of the real estate 
any net sales proceeds are expected to be applied to repaying amounts outstanding under the company s credit facilities 
if the company is unable to timely sell or otherwise dispose of the assets of janus on terms acceptable to abi and in accordance with applicable regulatory or other legal requirements  including canadian regulations and laws  such inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results and conditions may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that entail significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that its most critical accounting policies upon which its financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are those described below 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
asbestos liabilities as discussed previously  the company is party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from their previous manufacture of asbestos containing products 
abi has recorded in its consolidated balance sheet a liability and corresponding insurance receivable based on its estimates of the future costs and related insurance recoveries to settle asbestos litigation and pay for related legal and loss handling costs 
these estimates are based on a number of subjective assumptions  including the anticipated costs to settle claims  the claims dismissal rate  the cost to litigate claims  the number of claims expected to be received  and the applicability and allocation of insurance coverage to these costs 
additionally  due to the numerous uncertainties related to future asbestos litigation trends and costs  the company does not believe reasonable estimates can be developed for claim developments beyond a five year horizon 
accordingly  the company s estimated liability is based on claims currently filed as well as claims anticipated to be filed over the next five years 
a change in assumptions could have a material effect on the company s estimated liability 
for example  it is estimated that a decrease in the company s dismissal rate would result in a increase in liability assuming all other variables remained constant 
due to the highly subjective nature of these assumptions  the company has estimated a wide range of potential future costs and insurance recoveries and  because management believes that no amount within the range is more likely than any other  has recorded a liability and insurance receivable based on the low end of the range in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  the selection of a different amount within the range could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements  as could future developments  which may differ from those assumed in developing the company s estimates 
the company analyzes this estimate on an annual basis and reassesses the assumptions used as additional information becomes available over the course of time 
the company s subsidiary congoleum is a party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from its manufacture of asbestos containing products and is seeking confirmation of a plan of reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code as part of its strategy to resolve this liability 
congoleum s liability for settlements of asbestos claims is at least million  not including the cost to defend and litigate unsettled or future cases  which is substantially in excess of both the total assets of congoleum as well as congoleum s previous estimates made in prior periods of the maximum liability for both known and unasserted claims 
while congoleum purchased insurance coverage it believes applies to these claims  some of the insurance carriers are presently insolvent and the remaining solvent insurance carriers have disputed their coverage obligations 
congoleum believes the ultimate amount of its liability  and the amount of recoverable insurance  will be determined through some combination of negotiation  litigation  and bankruptcy court order  but that these amounts can no longer be reasonably estimated given all the uncertainties that presently exist 
congoleum expects that insurance will provide the vast majority of the recovery available to claimants  due to the amount of insurance coverage it purchased and the comparatively limited resources and value of congoleum itself 
congoleum believed that it did not have the necessary financial resources to litigate and or settle asbestos claims in the ordinary course of business  and filed for bankruptcy protection on december  in light of its bankruptcy filing and proposed plan of reorganization  congoleum believes the most meaningful measure of its probable loss due to asbestos litigation is the amount it will have to contribute to the plan trust plus the costs to effect the reorganization 
congoleum estimates the minimum remaining costs to complete the reorganization process to be million  of which it has recorded million as a current liability and million as a long term liability representing the minimum estimated amount of the note to be contributed to the plan trust 
these amounts do not include the liability associated with a million insurance settlement recorded as restricted cash which congoleum expects to contribute  less any amounts withheld pursuant to reimbursement arrangements  to the plan trust formed upon confirmation of its plan of reorganization 
congoleum also expects to recover million from insurance proceeds or the collateral trust or its successor pursuant to terms of the claimant agreement and related documents which provide for the plan trust to reimburse certain expenses incurred by the company 
the amount and timing of reimbursements that will be received will depend on when the trust receives funds from insurance settlements or other sources and whether the insurance proceeds exceed million  which is the required threshold for reimbursement of the first million spent by congoleum 
congoleum believes this threshold will be met  although there can be no assurances to that effect 
the maximum amount of the range of possible asbestos loss is limited to the going concern or liquidation value of congoleum  an amount which congoleum believes is substantially less than the minimum estimated liability for the known claims against it 
environmental contingencies as discussed previously  the company has incurred liabilities related to environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company owned sites 
the company accrues for its estimate of future remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including the extent of clean up activities to be performed  the methods employed in the clean up activities  the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  existing technology  current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience 
where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another  the minimum is accrued 
for sites with multiple prps  the company considers its likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs 
when future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage or payment from third parties  an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded related to the expected recovery 
a receivable reserve is recorded when recoveries are disputed or are not highly probable 
these estimates are based on certain assumptions such as the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  and the ultimate insurance coverage available 
these projects tend to be long term in nature  and these assumptions are subject to refinement as facts change 
as such  it is possible that the company may need to revise its recorded liabilities and receivables for environmental costs in future periods resulting in potentially material adjustments to the company s earnings in future periods 
the company closely monitors existing and potential environmental matters in an effort to minimize costs 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company provides for valuation reserves against its deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of sfas in evaluating the recovery of deferred tax assets  the company makes certain assumptions as to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years  the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income 
the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 
it is possible that the facts underlying these assumptions may not materialize in future periods  which may require the company to record additional deferred tax valuation allowances  or to reduce previously recorded valuation allowances 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors several noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering most of the company s employees 
the company also maintains health and life insurance programs for retirees 
benefits under the plans are based on years of service and employee compensation 
the costs and obligations associated with these plans are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include the long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rates and other factors 
these assumptions are evaluated and updated annually by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
other assumptions used include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and the rate of compensation increases 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
in  the company assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over four years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past actuarial gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities 
the discount rate is used to determine expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date  reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a variety of factors that affect the potential collectibility of the related receivables  including length of time receivables are past due  customer credit ratings  financial stability of customers  specific one time events and past customer history 
in addition  in circumstances where the company is made aware of specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance is established 
the majority of accounts are individually evaluated on a regular basis and appropriate reserves are established as deemed appropriate based on the criteria previously noted 
the remainder of the reserve is based on management s estimates and takes into consideration historical trends  market conditions and the composition of the company s customer base 
the risk associated with this estimate is that the company would not become aware of potential collectibility issues related to specific accounts and thereby become exposed to potential unreserved losses 
historically  the company s estimates and assumptions around the allowance have been reasonably accurate and the company has processes and controls in place to closely monitor customers and potential credit issues 
inventory allowances the company maintains obsolescence and slow moving allowances for inventory 
products and materials that are specifically identified as obsolete are fully reserved 
the remainder of the allowance is based on management s estimates and fluctuates with market conditions  design cycles and other economic factors 
risks associated with this allowance include unforeseen changes in business cycles that could affect the marketability of certain products and an unforecasted decline in current production 
management closely monitors the market place and related inventory levels and has historically maintained reasonably accurate allowance levels 
in addition  the company values certain inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
accordingly  a lifo valuation reserve is maintained to properly value these inventories 
risk factors that may affect future results the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum have significant asbestos liability and funding exposure  and the company s and congoleum s strategies for resolving this exposure may not be successful 
as more fully set forth in notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements  which is included in this report  the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum have significant liability and funding exposure for asbestos personal injury claims 
in connection with congoleum s strategy for resolving its asbestos liability  in  congoleum entered into settlement agreements with various asbestos claimants  which provides for an aggregate settlement value of at least million 
settlement of this obligation pursuant to the terms of congoleum s proposed modified plan is dependent on bankruptcy court confirmation of the plan of reorganization  including determinations by the bankruptcy court that the plan has satisfied certain criteria under the bankruptcy code  among other things 
there can be no assurance that congoleum will be successful in obtaining confirmation of congoleum s modified plan in a timely manner or at all 
any alternative plan of reorganization pursued by congoleum or confirmed by the bankruptcy court could vary significantly from the description in this report including descriptions incorporated by reference in this report 
furthermore  the estimated costs and contributions required to confirm and to effect the proposed modified plan of reorganization or an alternative plan could be significantly greater than currently estimated 
any plan of reorganization pursued by congoleum will be subject to numerous conditions  approvals and other requirements  including bankruptcy court approvals  and there can be no assurance that such conditions  approvals and other requirements will be satisfied or obtained 
as part of congoleum s plan of reorganization  congoleum would contribute to the plan trust certain of congoleum s rights to receive insurance proceeds for asbestos liabilities under its applicable insurance policies 
congoleum is currently involved in litigation with certain of its insurance carriers related to disputed insurance coverage for asbestos related liabilities  and certain insurance carriers have filed various objections to congoleum s previously filed plan of reorganization and related matters 
it is expected that these insurers will continue to vigorously contest their obligations to provide congoleum with insurance coverage for congoleum s asbestos liabilities and seek to prevent any contribution by congoleum of its rights to receive insurance for asbestos matters to the plan trust 
the first phase of the trial is scheduled to begin on june   and will address all issues and claims relating to whether the insurers are obligated to provide coverage under the policies at issue in this litigation for the global claimant agreement entered into by congoleum  including but not limited to all issues and claims relating to both congoleum s decision and conduct in entering into the claimant agreement and filing a pre packaged bankruptcy and the insurance company defendants decisions and conduct in opposing the claimant agreement and congoleum s pre packaged bankruptcy  the reasonableness and good faith of the claimant agreement  whether the claimant agreement breached any insurance policies and  if so  whether the insurance companies suffered any prejudice  and whether the insurance companies opposition to the claimant agreement and bankruptcy and various other conduct by the insurers has breached their duties of good faith and fair dealing such that they are precluded from asserting that congoleum s decision to enter into the claimant agreement constitutes any breach es on the part of congoleum 
the second phase of the trial will address all coverage issues  including but not limited to trigger and allocation 
the final phase of the trial will address bad faith punitive damages  if appropriate 
congoleum believes  however  that even if the insurers were to succeed in the first phase of the coverage action  such result would not deprive individual claimants of the right to seek payment from the affected insurance policies nor would such result preclude congoleum from amending the claimant agreement and seeking recovery under the claimant agreement as amended  moreover  congoleum does not believe that it would be deprived of coverage in place insurance for future obligations of or demands upon the insurers under the applicable insurance policies 
however  there can be no assurances of the outcome of these matters or their potential effect on congoleum s ability to obtain approval of its plan of reorganization 
the company has its own direct asbestos liability as well 
the company s strategy remains to vigorously defend and strategically settle its asbestos claims on a case by case basis 
to date  the company s insurers have funded substantially all of the company s liabilities and expenses related to its asbestos liability under the company s applicable insurance policies 
the company expects its insurance carriers will continue to defend and indemnify it for its asbestos liabilities for the foreseeable future 
if  however  it were not able to receive such coverage from its insurers for the company s asbestos liabilities and expenses that would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
some additional factors that could cause actual results to differ from congoleum s and the company s objectives for resolving asbestos liability include i the future cost and timing of estimated asbestos liabilities and payments and availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement from insurance companies  which underwrote the applicable insurance policies for congoleum and the company  for asbestos related claims  ii costs relating to the execution and implementation of any plan of reorganization pursued by congoleum  iii timely reaching an agreement with other creditors  or classes of creditors  that exist or may emerge  iv the company s and congoleum s satisfaction of the conditions and obligations under their respective outstanding debt instruments  and amendment of those outstanding debt instruments  as necessary  to permit congoleum and the company to satisfy their obligations under congoleum s proposed plan of reorganization  v the response from time to time of the company s and congoleum s lenders  customers  suppliers and other constituencies to the chapter process and related developments arising from the strategy to settle asbestos liability  vi congoleum s ability to maintain debtor in possession financing sufficient to provide it with funding that may be needed during the pendency of its chapter case and to obtain exit financing sufficient to provide it with funding that may be needed for its operations after emerging from the bankruptcy process  in each case  on reasonable terms  vii timely obtaining sufficient creditor and court approval of any reorganization plan  viii developments in and the outcome of insurance coverage litigation pending in new jersey state court involving congoleum  and certain insurers  and ix compliance with the bankruptcy code  including section g 
in addition  in view of american biltrite s relationships with congoleum  american biltrite could be affected by congoleum s negotiations  and there can be no assurance as to what that impact  positive or negative  might be 
in any event  the failure of congoleum to obtain confirmation and consummation of its anticipated chapter plan of reorganization would have a material adverse effect on congoleum s business  results of operations or financial condition and could have a material adverse effect on american biltrite s business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  there has been federal legislation proposed that  if adopted  would establish a national trust to provide compensation to victims of asbestos related injuries and channel all current and future asbestos related personal injury claims to that trust 
due to the uncertainties involved with the pending legislation  the company does not know what effects any such legislation  if adopted  may have upon its or congoleum s businesses  results of operations or financial conditions  or upon any plan of reorganization congoleum may decide to pursue 
to date  congoleum has expended significant amounts pursuant to resolving its asbestos liability relating to its proposed chapter plan of reorganization 
to the extent any federal legislation is enacted which does not credit congoleum for amounts paid by congoleum pursuant to its plan of reorganization or requires the company or congoleum to pay significant amounts to any national trust or otherwise  such legislation could have a material adverse effect on the company or congoleum s businesses  results of operations and financial conditions 
as a result of congoleum s significant liability and funding exposure for asbestos claims  there can be no assurance that if congoleum were to incur any unforecasted or unexpected liability or disruption to its business or operations it would be able to withstand that liability or disruption and continue as an operating company 
any significant increase of the company s asbestos liability and funding exposure would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operations and financial condition and possibly its ability to continue as a going concern 
for further information regarding the company s and congoleum s asbestos liability  insurance coverage and strategies to resolve that asbestos liability  please see notes  and of the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements  which are included in this report 
a substantial portion of the company s debt must be amended or refinanced  existing defaults under the company s debt agreements must be permanently effectively waived and the company s ability to obtain additional financing may be limited 
as of december   the company did not satisfy a financial covenant under the note agreement 
prudential has granted the company a temporary waiver of any event of default that would result from that failure to satisfy that financial covenant as of december  that temporary waiver is scheduled to expire on march  the company is currently negotiating with prudential for a permanent waiver of that covenant default or an amendment to the note agreement that would result in the company not violating that financial covenant as of december  while the company believes it will be able to successfully negotiate such a waiver or amendment  failure to do so would result in the company being in default of the note agreement 
the company is also negotiating with prudential for modifications to the financial covenants for under the note agreement to make them comparable to the financial covenants for in the amended credit facility 
while the company has been successful in such negotiations previously and believes it will be so again  failure to obtain such modifications or to obtain waivers of certain existing financial covenants would result in the company failing to satisfy the financial covenants as currently comprised during the measurement periods in such a failure would constitute a default under the note agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the note agreement and the credit facility  a default by the company under one of those agreements triggers a cross default under the other agreement 
if such a default occurs  bofa and prudential could respectively require the company to repay all amounts outstanding under the respective debt agreements 
if a default occurs and the company is unable to obtain a waiver from bofa and prudential and the company is required to repay all amounts outstanding under those agreements  the company would need to obtain funding from another source 
otherwise  the company would likely be unable to repay those outstanding amounts  in which case  bofa as administrative agent over the collateral securing the amounts outstanding under the credit facility and the note agreement  might exercise bofa s and prudential s rights over that collateral 
any default by the company under the credit facility or the note agreement that results in the company being required to immediately repay outstanding amounts under its debt agreements  and for which suitable replacement financing is not timely obtained  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the credit facility expires on january  although the company expects that the credit facility will be extended or replaced by that date  there can be no assurances in this regard 
if the company has outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at that date and the credit facility s term has not been extended beyond that date  such failure would result in a breach of the note agreement  which  for the reasons discussed in the preceding paragraph  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
under the terms of the company s debt agreements  the company s ability to obtain additional debt financing is limited 
moreover  since the company and most of its domestic subsidiaries have already granted security interests in most of their assets  the company s ability to obtain any additional debt financing may be limited 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum may incur substantial liability for environmental claims and compliance matters 
due to the nature of the company s and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum s businesses and certain of the substances which are or have been used  produced or discharged by them  the company s and congoleum s operations and facilities are subject to a broad range of federal  state  local and foreign legal and regulatory provisions relating to the environment  including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances at company and congoleum facilities and off site disposal locations 
the company and congoleum have historically expended substantial amounts for compliance with existing environmental laws or regulations  including environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company and congoleum owned sites 
the company and congoleum will continue to be required to expend amounts in the future because of the nature of their prior activities at their facilities  in order to comply with existing environmental laws  and those amounts may be substantial 
although the company and congoleum believe that those amounts should not have a material adverse effect on their respective financial positions  there is no certainty that these amounts will not have a material adverse effect on their respective financial positions because  as a result of environmental requirements becoming increasingly strict  neither the company nor congoleum is able to determine the ultimate cost of compliance with environmental laws and enforcement policies 
moreover  in addition to potentially having to pay substantial amounts for compliance  future environmental laws or regulations may require or cause the company or congoleum to modify or curtail their operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum  may incur substantial liability for other product and general liability claims 
in the ordinary course of their businesses  the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum become involved in lawsuits  administrative proceedings  product liability claims and other matters 
in some of these proceedings  plaintiffs may seek to recover large and sometimes unspecified amounts and the matters may remain unresolved for several years 
these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition if the company or congoleum  as applicable  is unable to successfully defend against or settle these matters  and its insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments against it or settlements relating to these matters or the company or congoleum  as applicable  is unable to collect insurance proceeds relating to these matters 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum are dependent upon a continuous supply of raw materials from third party suppliers and would be harmed if there were a significant  prolonged disruption in supply or increase in its raw material costs 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum generally design and engineer their own products 
most of the raw materials required by the company for its manufacturing operations are available from multiple sources  however  the company does purchase some of its raw materials from a single source or supplier 
any significant delay in or disruption of the supply of raw materials could substantially increase the company s cost of materials  require product reformulation or require qualification of new suppliers  any one or more of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company s majority owned subsidiary congoleum  does not have readily available alternative sources of supply for specific designs of transfer print paper  which are produced utilizing print cylinders engraved to congoleum s specifications 
although congoleum does not anticipate any loss of this source of supply  replacement could take a considerable period of time and interrupt production of certain products  which could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company and congoleum have occasionally experienced significant price increases for some of its raw materials 
in particular  industry supply conditions for specialty resins used in flooring have been very tight  despite significant price increases  in part due to a fire at a large resin plant in although the company and congoleum have not experienced any significant difficulties obtaining specialty resin  there can be no assurances that they may not have difficulty in the future  particularly if global supply conditions deteriorate 
raw material prices in increased significantly and are expected to remain high in and until additional capacity becomes available 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum operate in highly competitive markets and some of their competitors have greater resources  and in order to be successful  the company and congoleum must keep pace with and anticipate changing customer preferences 
the market for the company s and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum s products and services is highly competitive 
some of their respective competitors have greater financial and other resources and access to capital 
furthermore  to the extent any of the company s or congoleum s competitors make a filing under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code and emerge from bankruptcy as continuing operating companies that have shed much of their pre filing liabilities  those competitors could have a cost competitive advantage over congoleum 
in addition  in order to maintain their competitive positions  the company and congoleum may need to make substantial investments in their businesses  including  as applicable  product development  manufacturing facilities  distribution network and sales and marketing activities 
competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for their products and in the loss of market share for their products 
moreover  due to the competitive nature of their industries  they may be commercially restricted from raising or even maintaining the sales prices of their products  which could result in the incurrence of significant operating losses if their expenses were to increase or otherwise represent an increased percentage of sales 
the markets in which the company and congoleum compete are characterized by frequent new product introductions and changing customer preferences 
there can be no assurance that the company s and congoleum s existing products and services will be properly positioned in the market or that the company and congoleum will be able to introduce new or enhanced products or services into their respective markets on a timely basis  or at all  or that those new or enhanced products or services will receive customer acceptance 
the company s and congoleum s failure to introduce new or enhanced products or services on a timely basis  keep pace with industry or market changes or effectively manage the transitions to new products  technologies or services could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum are subject to general economic conditions and conditions specific to their respective industries 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum are subject to the effects of general economic conditions 
a sustained general economic slowdown could have serious negative consequences for the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  their businesses are affected by the economic factors that affect their respective industries 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum could realize shipment delays  depletion of inventory and increased production costs resulting from unexpected disruptions of operations at any of the company s or congoleum s facilities 
the company s and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum s businesses depend upon their ability to timely manufacture and deliver products that meet the needs of their customers and the end users of their products 
if the company or congoleum were to realize an unexpected  significant and prolonged disruption of its operations at any of its facilities  including disruptions in its manufacturing operations  it could result in shipment delays of its products  depletion of its inventory as a result of reduced production and increased production costs as a result of taking actions in an attempt to cure the disruption or carry on its business while the disruption remains 
any resulting delay  depletion or increased production cost could result in increased costs  lower revenues and damaged customer and product end user relations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum offer limited warranties on their products which could result in the company or congoleum incurring significant costs as a result of warranty claims 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum offer a limited warranty on many of their products against manufacturing defects 
in addition  as a part of its efforts to differentiate mid and high end products through color  design and other attributes  congoleum offers enhanced warranties with respect to wear  moisture discoloration and other performance characteristics which generally increase with the price of such products 
if the company or congoleum were to incur a significant number of warranty claims  the resulting warranty costs could be substantial 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum rely on a small number of customers and distributors for a significant portion of their sales or to sell their products 
the company s tape division principally sells its products through distributors 
sales to five unaffiliated customers accounted for approximately of the company s tape division s net sales for the year ended december  and of its net sales for the year ended december  the loss of the largest unaffiliated customer and or two or more of the other unaffiliated customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company s majority owned subsidiary congoleum principally sells its products through distributors 
although congoleum has more than one distributor in some of its distribution territories and actively manages its credit exposure to its distributors  the loss of a major distributor could have a materially adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
congoleum derives a significant percentage of its sales from two of its distributors 
these two distributors accounted for approximately of congoleum s net sales for the year ended december  and of congoleum s net sales for the year ended december  the company s subsidiary k m associates lp sells its products through its own direct sales force and  indirectly  through a wholly owned subsidiary and through third party sales representatives 
three of k m associates lp s customers accounted for approximately of its net sales for the year ended december  and of its net sales for the year ended december  the loss of k m associates lp s largest customer would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum depend on key executives to run their businesses  and the loss of any of these executives would likely harm the company s business 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum depend on key executives to run their businesses 
in particular  three of the persons that serve as key executives at the company also serve as key executives at congoleum 
the company s future success will depend largely upon the continued service of these key executives  all of whom have no employment contract with the company or congoleum  as applicable  and may terminate their employment at any time without notice 
although certain key executives of the company and congoleum are  directly or indirectly  large shareholders of the company or congoleum  and thus are less likely to terminate their employment  the loss of any key executive  or the failure by the key executive to perform in his current position  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition
