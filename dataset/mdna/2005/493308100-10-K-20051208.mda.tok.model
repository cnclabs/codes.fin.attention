overview we offer technology based services that enable corporate enterprises to improve their online business performance and communications technologies 
formerly  we had internally categorized and analyzed our offerings as performance measurement services and performance management solutions 
in order to view the progress of our business consistent with how we manage it internally  we now categorize our offerings as customer experience management cem and service level management slm 
the slm category comprises all our offerings formerly categorized as performance measurement services and all performance management solutions except webeffective 
the cem category consists of the webeffective platform whether sold on a technology license basis or as part of a competitive intelligence study or custom engagement 
both these categories of services help our customers reduce costs  improve customer satisfaction and increase profitability 
slm represents all of our technical measurement  monitoring and management services including our traditional perspective measurement services  wireless perspective  voip perspective  load testing and enterprise solutions 
cem includes our marketing oriented services obtained primarily from the netraker and vividence acquisitions 
we offer our slm services primarily on a subscription basis and our cem services primarily on an engagement basis although  in some cases  we offer slm professional services on an incident and per engagement basis 
we also offer the self service use of our cem technology for a fixed period on a subscription basis 
subscription fees range from monthly to annual commitments  and vary based on the type of service selected  the number of urls  transactions or devices monitored  the number of measurement locations 
table of contents and or appliances  the frequency of the measurements and any additional features ordered 
engagements typically involve fixed price contracts based on the complexity of the project  the size of a cem panel  and the type of testing to be conducted 
our net income increased by approximately million  from net income of approximately million for the year ended september  to net income of approximately million for the year ended september  total revenue increased by approximately million or  from approximately million for the year ended september  to approximately million for the year ended september  the increase in total revenue was mainly attributable to increased professional services revenue due to increased contribution from webeffective intelligence platform as a result of our fiscal acquisitions of netraker and vividence 
total expenses increased by approximately million or  from approximately million for the year ended september  to approximately million for the year ended september  the increase in total expenses was mainly attributable to increased personnel costs related to the acquisitions of vividence  netraker  and hudson williams in the second half of fiscal  and hudson williams europe in february  and higher spending on legal  accounting and audit fees mainly attributable to the increased cost of compliance requirements 
professional services revenue is generally paid for as services are performed as compared to subscription services revenue that is billed monthly or paid in advance 
professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased during the year ended september   resulting in decreased deferred revenue 
our results improved by approximately million  from a net loss of approximately million for the year ended september  to net income of approximately million for the year ended september  total revenue increased by approximately million or  from approximately million for the year ended september  to approximately million for the year ended september  total expenses decreased by approximately million or  from approximately million for the year ended september  to approximately million for the year ended september  we anticipate that total expenses for the first quarter of fiscal will increase significantly compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal since we are required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  on october  total expenses will also increase as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal due to additional investment in our sales and marketing efforts 
for the year ended september   our largest customers accounted for approximately of total revenue 
we cannot be certain that customers that have accounted for significant revenue in past periods  individually or in aggregate  will renew our services and continue to generate revenue in any future period 
in addition  our customers that have monthly renewal arrangements may terminate their services at any time with little or no penalty 
if we lose a major customer or a group of significant customers  our revenue could significantly decline 
we believe that the challenges for our business include increasing both slm and cem revenue by generating organic revenue growth from our existing services and by continuing to internally develop enhanced services  integrating and realizing anticipated benefits from our prior acquisitions and any acquisitions that may occur in the future and continuing to control our expenses for fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these 
table of contents estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements recognition of revenue allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance allocation of purchase price for business combinations impairment assessments of goodwill  identifiable purchased intangibles  and long lived assets stock based compensation accounting for income taxes and deferred income tax assets recognition of revenue substantially all of our revenue is derived from three sources subscriptions to our slm services  otherwise known as subscription revenue  subscriptions to our cem services for the use of our technology for our webeffective intelligence platform which  depending on its use  is recorded as either subscription or professional services revenue  and providing cem and slm professional services including all consulting services and other miscellaneous items 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  service has occurred or milestone or deliverable has been completed  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
one of the critical judgments we make is the assessment that collectibility is probable 
our recognition of revenue is based on our assessment of the probability of collecting the related accounts receivable balance on a customer by customer basis considering past payment history and credit history 
the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
in cases where collectibility is not deemed probable  revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we recognize our subscription services revenue  which is generally deferred upon invoicing  ratably over the service period  generally ranging from one to twelve months 
for some customers  subscription services revenue is invoiced monthly upon completion of the services 
revenue related to the use of our webeffective intelligence platform is accounted for as either subscription services revenue or professional services revenue depending upon its use 
if a customer purchases a subscription to our webeffective intelligence platform  we recognize revenue ratably over the subscription period  commencing on the day service is provided and such revenue is recorded as subscription services revenue 
if the webeffective intelligence platform is used to conduct evaluations on consulting engagements  we recognize revenue upon the completion of the evaluation and record such revenue as professional services revenue 
we do not generally grant refunds 
all discounts granted reduce revenue 
revenue is not recognized for free trial periods 
we recognize our professional services revenue ratably as the services are performed  typically over a period of one to three months 
for most consulting engagements that span more than one month  we generally recognize revenue as milestones or deliverables are completed as this is our estimate of the outputs to recognize the proportional performance under such contracts 

table of contents revenue results are difficult to predict and any shortfall in revenue or unforeseen delay in recognizing revenue could cause operating results to vary from quarter to quarter 
deferred revenue is comprised of all unearned revenue that has been collected in advance  primarily consisting of unearned subscription services revenue and is recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet until the revenue is earned 
any uncollected deferred revenue reduces the balance of accounts receivable 
allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and billing allowance of  or of total accounts receivable  and  or of total accounts receivable  as of september  and  respectively 
the decrease in our allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance is primarily due to improved collection experience rates and a reduction in actual billing adjustments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical trends  experience and current market and industry conditions 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the age of each invoice of the accounts receivable aging  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review invoices greater than days past due to determine whether an allowance is appropriate based on the receivable balance 
in addition  we maintain a reserve for all other invoices  which is calculated by applying a percentage  based on historical collection trends  to the outstanding accounts receivable balance as well as specifically identified accounts that are deemed uncollectible 
billing allowance represents the reserve for potential billing adjustments that are recorded as a reduction of revenue and represents a percentage of revenue based on historical trends and experience 
the allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance represent management s best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable and billing adjustments  including unforeseen declines in market conditions and collection rates and the number of billing adjustments  may result in additional allowances in the future or reductions in allowances due to future recoveries or trends 
allocation of purchase price for business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as any in process research and development ipr d  based on their estimated fair values 
our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to acquisitions is usually determined based on valuations performed by an independent third party 
such valuations require making significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include  but are not limited to  future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists and acquired developed technologies  expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from projects when completed and discount rates 
estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
other estimates such as accruals associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
impairment assessments of goodwill  identifiable purchased intangibles  and long lived assets goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
we evaluate our identifiable goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets for impairment on an annual basis  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable for our single reporting unit 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  
table of contents significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
management continually applies its judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted net cash flows used to assess recoverability of the intangible assets and the fair value of the asset group 
if future events or circumstances indicate that an impairment assessment is required and an asset group is determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
we performed an annual impairment review during the fourth quarter in fiscal   and we did not record an impairment charge based on our reviews 
the goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of september  was approximately million as compared to million as of september  the decrease was primarily related to the recognition of net deferred tax assets in fiscal associated with net operating losses not previously recognized for accounting purposes that related to our vividence acquisition 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements under item of this report for additional information regarding the recognition of net deferred tax assets associated with our vividence acquisition 
if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on goodwill to reduce its carrying amount to its estimated fair value 
if future events or circumstances indicate that an impairment assessment is required on intangible or long lived assets and an asset group is determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
stock based compensation we issue stock options to our employees and outside directors and provide our employees the right to purchase ordinary shares under employee stock purchase plans 
we account for our stock based compensation plans under the intrinsic value method of accounting as defined by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and related interpretations 
for equity instruments under fixed plans  apb no 
does not require that any amount of expense be recorded in the statement of operations if the exercise price of the stock options is the same as the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  however  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
 does require disclosure of these amounts in a pro forma table to the financial statements 
in determining this disclosure  the value of an option is estimated using the black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and a change in our assumptions could materially affect the fair value estimate  and thus  the total calculated costs associated with the grant of stock options or issue of stock under employee stock purchase plans 
we expect our accounting policies regarding stock based compensation to be materially affected by our adoption of sfas no 
r  which is described under recent accounting pronouncements 
accounting for income taxes and deferred income tax assets we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liabilities  including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the 
table of contents extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
if a valuation allowance is decreased  deferred tax expense may be reduced  goodwill may be reduced  or paid in capital may be increased  depending on the nature and source of the deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 
we perform an analysis of our effective tax rate and we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets quarterly 
prior to fiscal  our deferred tax assets had been offset by a full valuation allowance because of our history of losses through fiscal  limited number of profitable quarters and the impact of acquisitions on our quarterly results 
as we have demonstrated profitability in nine of our most recent quarters  management has recorded approximately million of deferred tax assets as of september   and has recognized approximately million of income tax benefit and approximately million as a reduction in goodwill associated with the partial recognition of its net deferred assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal based on the following factors we have demonstrated profitability in nine of our most recent quarters  we believe that it is more likely than not that million of deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future 
this million benefit was partially offset by a provision for income taxes of  resulting in a net tax benefit of approximately million 
the million of the deferred tax asset recorded as a reduction of goodwill was due to the recognition of net operating losses that arose from the vividence acquisition which had previously not been recognized for accounting purposes 
the uncertainties which could affect the realization of our deferred tax assets include various factors as described in the risk factors section including the amount of deductions for tax purposes related to our stock options  potential successful challenges to the deferred tax assets by taxing authorities  and a mismatch of the period during which the type of taxable income and the deferred tax assets are realized 
as of september   we had a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting that existed as of september  with respect to our accounting for income taxes 
as described in item a of this report  we are taking steps to ensure that this material weakness is remediated by implementing enhanced control processes over accounting for deferred income tax assets and liabilities  including the valuation allowance 
we establish liabilities or reserves when we believe that certain tax positions are likely to be challenged and we may not succeed  despite our belief that our tax returns are fully supportable 
we adjust these reserves  as well as related interest  in light of changing circumstances such as the progress of tax exams 
we evaluate these reserves each quarter and adjust the reserves and the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances regarding the probability of realizing tax benefits  such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for known material tax contingencies  however due to the complexity involved  management is not able to estimate the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts recorded 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth selected items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue for each of the three years ended september  year ended september  revenue subscription services professional services total revenue expenses costs of subscription services costs of professional services research and development sales and marketing operations general and administrative excess occupancy costs amortization of identifiable intangible assets amortization of stock based compensation and in process research and development total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income interest and other expenses benefit provision for income taxes net income loss comparison of fiscal years ended september  and revenue change in thousands subscription services professional services total revenue subscription services 
subscription services revenue consists of fees from subscriptions to our traditional perspective measurements  monitoring  testing  diagnostic and webeffective intelligence platform services 
revenue from subscription services increased million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  subscription services represented and of total revenue for the year ended september  and  respectively 
the increase in revenue in absolute dollars  as listed in descending order of impact  was primarily due to increased revenue from transaction perspective  application perspective  webeffective intelligence platform  and enterprise solution 
the increases were offset by a decrease in sales of web site perspective  network perspective  test perspective and netmechanic services 
at september   we measured for revenue  page measurements or urls  and  internet connected devices 
at september   we measured for revenue  urls  and  internet connected devices 
subscription services fees can vary based on the number of urls measured  the number of devices monitored  the number of measurement locations  the number of users  the number of hours  the frequency of the measurements  the number of private agents  the additional features ordered  and the type of services purchased 

table of contents professional services 
revenue from professional services increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  revenue from professional services represented approximately and of total revenue for the year ended september  and  respectively 
the increase in revenue was primarily due to increased professional services contribution from webeffective intelligence platform as a result of our fiscal acquisitions of netraker and vividence 
because our professional services are provided on a per engagement basis  revenue depends on the number of engagements and the size of such engagements 
as a result  professional services revenue is less predictable than subscription services revenue and may vary from period to period 
we believe that professional services revenue may increase somewhat in the future as a percentage of total revenue  as our existing professional services become more widely used  as a result of the acquisitions of netraker  hudson williams  vividence and hudson williams europe in late and early and as we introduce additional services that require consulting expertise 
however  we cannot assure you that this revenue will increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
in addition to analyzing revenue for subscription services and professional services  management also internally analyzes revenue categorized as service level management slm and customer experience management cem 
the following table identifies which services are categorized as slm and cem revenue and where they are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations listed in alphabetical order subscription services professional services service level management application perspective x application perspective private edition x diagnostic services x enterprise solutions x x loadpro x netmechanic x network perspective x professional services x red alert x streaming perspective x test perspective x transaction perspective x webintegrity x web site perspective x wireless perspective x voip perspective x customer experience management webeffective intelligence platform x x the following table summarizes slm and cem revenue in thousands change for the year ended september slm subscriptions slm engagements total slm revenue cem subscriptions cem engagements total cem revenue total revenue 
table of contents total slm revenue increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal slm revenue represented and of total revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the increase in slm revenue for the year ended september  over the corresponding period in fiscal  as listed in descending order of impact  was primarily due to increased subscriptions for transaction perspective services and application perspective services which were newly introduced in the second quarter of fiscal  and increased contribution from our enterprise solutions 
the increases were offset by decreases in sales of web site perspective and network perspective services 
total cem revenue increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal cem represented and of total revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to increased contribution from our webeffective intelligence platform services as a result of our acquisitions of netraker in april and vividence in september for the years ended september  and  no single customer accounted for more than of total revenue 
at september   one customer accounted for of total accounts receivable of which of this customer s balance was subsequently received 
at september   no single customer accounted for more than of total accounts receivable 
international sales were approximately and of our total revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
expenses costs of subscription services and professional services change in thousands costs of subscription services costs of professional services costs of subscription services 
costs of subscription services consist of connection fees to major telecommunication and internet access providers for bandwidth usage of our measurement computers  which are located around the world  depreciation  maintenance and other equipment charges for our measurement and data collection infrastructure 
costs of subscription services decreased by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  and represented and of subscription services revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily due to reduced costs for bandwidth  partially offset by additional connection fees and depreciation and hardware charges associated with our netraker and vividence acquisitions 
we believe that costs of subscription services in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will remain comparable to the fourth quarter of fiscal costs of professional services 
costs of professional services consist of compensation expenses and related costs for professional services personnel  external consulting costs to deliver our professional services revenue  panel and reward costs associated with our webeffective intelligence platform services  all load testing bandwidth costs and related network infrastructure costs 
costs of professional services increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  and represented and of professional service revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the increase in costs of professional services was primarily due to additional personnel and consulting costs from our acquisitions of netraker in april  hudson williams in july  vividence in september  and hudson williams europe in february we expect that the costs of professional services as a percentage of professional services revenue will continue to be greater than the costs of subscription services as a percentage of subscription services revenue 
we expect that costs of professional services in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will increase due to the expensing of stock based compensation with the adoption of sfas no 
r 

table of contents research and development change in thousands research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for research and development personnel 
research and development expenses increased by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  this increase was primarily attributable to additional personnel costs as a result of our acquisitions of netraker  hudson williams  and vividence in the second half of fiscal  higher consulting costs and higher amortization and depreciation resulting from continued investment in software and hardware equipment 
we anticipate that research and development expenses in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will increase from the fourth quarter of fiscal due to additional personnel costs related to the development of new or enhanced services and the expensing of stock based compensation with the adoption of sfas no 
r 
sales and marketing change in thousands sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  lead referral fees  marketing programs and travel expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to additional personnel costs as a result of our acquisitions of netraker  hudson williams  and vividence in the second half of fiscal and increased spending on certain marketing programs 
we believe that continued investments in our sales and marketing efforts are essential for us to maintain our market position and to further increase acceptance of our services 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will increase compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal due to additional personnel and marketing costs to help drive adoption of our services and to the expensing of stock based compensation with the adoption of sfas no 
r 
operations change in thousands operations operations expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for management and technical support personnel who manage and maintain our field measurement and collection infrastructure and headquarters data center  and provide basic and extended customer support 
our operations personnel also work closely with other departments to assure the reliability of our services and to support our sales and marketing activities 
our operations expenses increased by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in operations expenses was primarily due to additional personnel costs as a result of our acquisitions of netraker  hudson williams and vividence in the second half of fiscal  and to a lesser extent  increased spending on communication services and consulting 
we anticipate that operations expenses in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will increase compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal due to additional personnel costs and the expensing of stock based compensation with the adoption of sfas no 
r 

table of contents general and administrative change in thousands general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  accounting  legal and administrative expenses  insurance  professional services fees and other general corporate expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in our general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased costs for corporate governance  compliance requirements  legal fees  and audit work  increased spending in temporary and permanent personnel costs  and  to a lesser extent  the netraker litigation settlement 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal will increase due to the expensing of stock based compensation with the adoption of sfas no 
r  offset partially by a decrease due to lower planned temporary personnel costs 
excess occupancy costs change in thousands excess occupancy costs excess occupancy costs are fixed expenses associated with the unoccupied portion of our headquarters building  such as property taxes  insurance  and depreciation 
these particular expenses are reduced by the rental income from the leasing of our space in our headquarters building 
the costs are based on the actual unoccupied square footage  which was and for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the decrease in expenses was primarily due to an increase in tenant income due to the leasing of additional space 
we expect the unoccupied portion of our headquarters building for the first quarter of fiscal will remain comparable to the fourth quarter of fiscal amortization of identifiable intangible assets and in process research and development change in thousands amortization of identifiable intangible assets in process research and development costs total amortization of identifiable intangible assets and in process research and development amortization of identifiable intangible assets increased by  for the year ended september  as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal primarily due to increased amortization of identifiable intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions of matrixnet in december  netraker in april  hudson williams in july  and vividence in september  offset partially by intangibles associated with our acquisition of netmechanic becoming fully amortized in april we review our identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
at september   we had a remaining balance of approximately million of identifiable intangible assets that are being amortized over a three or four year expected life 
we expect the amortization of identifiable intangible assets to be approximately  for the first quarter of fiscal  assuming no 
table of contents additional acquisitions or impairment charges 
we expect the remaining carrying value of the identifiable intangible assets as of september   as listed in the table below  will be fully amortized by december in thousands technology based customer based total net carrying value at september  the in process research and development expense of  for the year ended september  was related to the estimated fair value of an acquired in process research and development project in connection with the acquisition of vividence 
this project was related to vividence s technology for its web based customer research  which had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the estimated fair value of this project was determined based on the avoided cost approach as of the acquisition date where the fair value of the acquired technology was equal to the costs which an acquirer would avoid spending in developing a similar functional technology 
this amount was immediately expensed as of the acquisition date during the three months ended september  this web based customer research technology became generally available in february interest income  and interest and other expenses change in thousands interest income interest and other expenses interest income  interest and other expenses  net interest income  and interest and other expenses  net  increased by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in interest income  and interest and other expenses  net  was primarily attributable to increased investment yields resulting from higher market interest rates earned on our invested cash 
substantially all of the interest income represents interest earned from our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
we expect that interest income  and interest and other expense  net  for the first quarter of fiscal will be approximately  absent any additional transactions  and assuming no material changes in interest rates 
benefit provision for income taxes change in thousands benefit provision for income taxes for the year ended september   we recorded a net tax benefit of approximately million 
our effective tax rate for the year ended september  was approximately before recording in the fourth quarter of the year ended september  an income tax benefit totaling approximately million associated with the partial recognition of our net deferred assets based upon demonstrated profitability in nine of our most recent quarters and it is more likely than not that million of deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future 
the million benefit was partially offset by a provision for income taxes of for the year ended september   we recorded a tax provision of approximately  our effective tax rate for the year ended september  was approximately  before recording in the fourth 
table of contents quarter of the year ended september   a net income tax benefit totaling  associated with resolution of tax matters relating to a foreign subsidiary and united states us state income taxes  which reduced the effective tax rate to approximately 
the increase of in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in professional revenues in europe which are taxed at a higher rate than us profits due to the lack of loss carryforwards in europe 
we establish liabilities or reserves when we believe that certain tax positions are likely to be challenged and we may not succeed  despite our belief that our tax returns are fully supportable 
we adjust these reserves  as well as related interest  in light of changing circumstances such as the progress of tax examinations and the expiration of the statute of limitations 
as of september   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximately million and million available to reduce future income subject to income taxes  respectively 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire  if not utilized  in the years through state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire if not utilized  in the years through in addition  as of september   we had research credit carryforwards for both federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million each available to reduce future income taxes 
the federal research credit carryforwards begin to expire in the year the unused california research credits carry forwards are available indefinitely 
the foreign net operating loss carryforwards  principally in the united kingdom  have been utilized through fiscal there are no other significant loss carryforwards in other foreign jurisdictions 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because it is management s intention to reinvest such undistributed earnings outside the united states 
federal and california tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
we have preliminarily determined that ownership changes have occurred  and the effects of the limitations have been included in the loss and credit carryforwards 
if an ownership change has occurred at different dates or in addition to the dates preliminarily identified  the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be significantly reduced

the increase in revenue in absolute dollars  as listed in descending order of impact  resulted primarily due to the increased contribution from webeffective intelligence platform as a result of our fiscal acquisitions of netraker and vividence  and from our enterprise solutions  and loadpro services 
because our professional services are provided on a per engagement basis  revenue depends on the number of engagements and the size of such engagements 
as a result  professional services revenue is less predictable than subscription services revenue and may vary from period to period

the estimated fair value of this project was determined based on the avoided costs approach as of the acquisition date where the fair value of the acquired technology is equal to the costs  which an acquirer will avoid spending in developing a similar functional technology

cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments held at major banks  commercial paper  money market mutual funds and other money market securities with original maturities of three months or less 
short term investments consist of investment grade corporate and government debt securities and issuances and auction rate securities with moody s ratings of a or better 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and working capital as of september   compared to september   was primarily a result of cash used for the repurchase of common stock of approximately million  capital expenditures of approximately million  and payments related to our acquisitions of approximately million  offset by cash provided by operating activities of approximately million and cash provided by the issuance of common stock of approximately million related to employee stock options exercises and employee stock purchases 

table of contents we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  and the timing and amount of tax and other payments 
cash flows from operating activities our largest source of operating cash flow is cash collections from our customers for our subscription and professional services 
payments from customers for subscription services are generally collected in the beginning of the subscription period  ranging from one to twelve months 
payments from some of our customers are collected at the end of the monthly service period or as milestones are completed 
our primary use of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  payment of insurance  regulatory compliance and other expenses for the operations of our business 
fiscal compared to fiscal cash flows from operating activities decreased for the year ended september  compared to the prior year primarily due to lower net income  excluding all amortization and depreciation and deferred tax asset charges  and decreases in non acquisition related deferred revenue  and payments of liabilities 
the decline in the dso was due to more timely collections 
the decrease in non acquisition related deferred revenue was mainly due to the shift in the mix of revenue from subscription to professional services 
subscription revenue is generally billed monthly or paid in advance 
professional services revenue  on the other hand  is generally billed when services are performed 
professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased during the year ended september   resulting in decreased non acquisition related deferred revenue 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses was mainly due to the timing of certain payments associated with our headquarters building and periodic insurance renewals 
fiscal compared to fiscal cash flows from operating activities increased for the year ended september  compared to the prior year primarily due to higher net income  excluding all non cash amortization and depreciation charges  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  and an increase in non acquisition related deferred revenue  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in non acquisition related deferred revenue was mainly attributable to an increase in the value of prepaid invoices and deferred revenue arising from vividence subsequent to the acquisition in september net accounts receivable increased primarily due to the increase in revenue for fiscal as compared to the corresponding period in the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was mainly attributable to an increase in personnel costs and related accruals such as vacation associated with our recent acquisitions and employee stock purchase plan contributions withheld and increased spending in legal and audit services related to regulatory compliance and acquisitions 
cash flow from investing activities the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases and maturities of investments 
we also use cash to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth and infrastructure 
fiscal compared to fiscal cash flows from investing activities increased for the year ended september  compared to the prior year primarily due to higher proceeds from maturities of marketable securities  net of purchases 
the increase was also attributable  to a lesser extent  to lower capital expenditures and fewer acquisition activities for the year ended september  
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal cash flows from investing activities decreased for the year ended september  compared to the prior year primarily due to cash paid for our acquisitions of matrixnet in december  netraker  hudson williams  and vividence in the second half of fiscal we also utilized approximately million to purchase property and equipment  primarily for our production infrastructure  information systems  and tenant improvements associated with space that we had rented in our headquarters building and approximately million for the net purchases of short term securities 
cash flows from financing activities the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to payments made for stock repurchases and proceeds received from the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan 
our board of directors has approved a plan to repurchase shares of our common stock 
the board has expanded the repurchase program several times by either increasing the authorized number of shares to be repurchased or by authorizing a fixed dollar amount expansion  most recently in october from the inception of the stock repurchase program in january to september   a total of approximately million shares have been repurchased in the open market for approximately million 
at september   approximately million was available to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program 
cash flow from operations and existing cash balances were used to repurchase our common stock 
fiscal compared to fiscal cash flows from financing activities decreased for the year ended september  compared to the prior year primarily due to the repurchases of our common stock  partially offset by the proceeds received from the issuance of common stock associated with employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan 
we utilized approximately million to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market 
we received approximately million and million from the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan for the years ended september  and  respectively 
fiscal compared to fiscal cash flows from financing activities increased since we did not repurchase our common stock during the year ended september  for the year ended september   we used approximately million for the repurchase of approximately million shares of our common stock  primarily pursuant to the two issuer tender offers completed in fiscal we received approximately million and million from the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan for the years ended september and  respectively 
commitments and contractual obligations as of september   our principal commitments consisted of approximately million in real property operating leases and equipment capital and operating leases  with various lease terms  the longest of which expires in august additionally  we had contingent commitments ranging in length from one to twelve months to bandwidth and collocation providers amounting to  in the aggregate for locations  which commitments become due if we terminate any of these agreements prior to their expiration 
at present  we do not intend to terminate any of these agreements prior to their expiration 
we expect to continue to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth 
we expect to make additional capital expenditures of approximately million related to our operations and headquarters building for the first quarter of fiscal  absent any other acquisitions or extraordinary transactions 

table of contents the following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  in thousands payment due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations leases commercial commitments bandwidth and collocation total we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
factors that could affect our cash position include potential acquisitions  additional stock repurchases  decreases in customers or renewals  decreases in revenue or changes in the value of our short term investments 
if  after some period of time  cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a credit facility 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the term of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders  and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  our business may be harmed 
pursuant to the hudson williams europe hwe acquisition asset purchase agreement  an additional contingent consideration payment would be made if certain revenue and profitability targets were achieved by the acquired business through june  the full amount of the additional contingent consideration cash payment of  was accrued as of september  since profitability targets were achieved by hwe through june  off balance sheet arrangements we did not enter into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in a unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us 
indemnification we do not generally indemnify customers for our measuring  monitoring and testing web based applications against legal claims that our products and services infringe on third party intellectual property rights 
other agreements entered into by us may include indemnification provisions that we could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against us or an indemnified third party 
however  we have never been a party to an infringement claim and in the opinion of management  we do not have a liability related to any infringement claims subject to indemnification and as such  there is no material adverse affect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations
