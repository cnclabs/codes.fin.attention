operating income increased in fiscal to million of sales from million of net sales for fiscal on a reporting segment basis  wireless operating income was million for fiscal  an improvement of million from a wireless operating loss of million for fiscal the main reasons for the increase in wireless income in fiscal were the company s restructuring and cost reduction activities in the second half of fiscal which lowered wireless operating costs  the discontinuation of some unprofitable and low margin wireless ferrite products  and the million increase in wireless sales in fiscal compared to fiscal space and defense operating income fell  in fiscal to million  compared to million in fiscal this decrease resulted from the lower sales volume and a change in product mix during fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal sales included more volume attributable to military programs  while sales for fiscal consisted of more profitable shipments for commercial space programs 
other income 
other income is primarily interest income received on invested cash balances 
other income decreased to million of net sales for fiscal  from million of net sales for fiscal this decrease was caused by the decline in market interest rates in fiscal brought about by reductions in the federal funds rate  and the decrease in investable cash balances due to the million expenditure to repurchase shares of the company s common stock for treasury shares during fiscal income taxes

critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments management uses in applying the company s most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results reported in the company s financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of anaren s financial condition and results  and that require management to make the most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company s most critical policies include valuation of accounts receivable  which impacts general and administrative expense  valuation of inventory  which impacts cost of sales and gross margin  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible and long lived assets  which impacts write offs of goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets  and accounting for income taxes  which impacts the valuation allowance and the effective tax rate 
management reviews the estimates  including  but not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and income tax valuations on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experiences  current conditions and future expectations 
the reviews are performed regularly and adjustments are made as required by current available information 
the company believes these estimates are reasonable  but actual results could and have differed at times from these estimates 
the company s accounts receivable represent those amounts which have been billed to its customers but not yet collected 
the company analyzes various factors including historical experience  credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts balance is established based on the portion of those accounts receivable which are deemed to be potentially uncollectible 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing of costs recognized 
the company states inventories at the lower of cost or market  using a standard cost methodology to determine the cost basis for the inventory 
this method approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis 
the recoverability of inventories is based on the types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand  pricing  competition and changes in technology 
the company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the amount may not be realized 
the company evaluates the need for valuation allowances on a regular basis and adjusts the allowance as needed 
these adjustments  when made  would have an impact on the company s financial statements in the period that they were recorded 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized to their residual values over those estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefit consumed 
long lived assets with estimated useful lives are depreciated to their residual values over those useful lives in proportion to the economic value consumed 
long lived assets are tested for impairment at the group level  which is usually an economic unit such as a manufacturing facility or department  which has a measurable economic output or product 
long lived assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable and exceeds its fair market value 
this circumstance exists if the carrying amount of the assets in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value as determined by the discounted cash flow or in the case of negative cash flow  an independent market appraisal of the asset 
goodwill is tested annually during the fourth fiscal quarter  or sooner if indicators of impairment exist  for impairment by the company at the reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
valuation methods for determining the fair value of the reporting unit include reviewing quoted market prices and discounted cash flows 
if the goodwill is indicated as being impaired the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  the fair value of the reporting unit is then allocated to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
this implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill and  if it is less  the company would then recognize an impairment loss 
the projection of future cash flows for the goodwill impairment analysis requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the assets and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in changes in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the use of different assumptions could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations for the years ended june   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the positive cash flow from operations was due primarily to profit before depreciation in each year 
in both fiscal and  the positive cash flow from earnings was offset by a combined rise in receivables and inventory in each year of million and million  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses the company s possible exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
as of june   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  all of which consisted of highly liquid investments in marketable debt securities 
the marketable debt securities at date of purchase normally have maturities between one and months  are exposed to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical decrease in market interest rate of from june  rates  or  would have reduced net income and cash flow by approximately  or per share for the quarter 
due to the relatively short maturities of the securities and its ability to hold those investments to maturity  the company does not believe that an immediate decrease in interest rates would have a significant effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
over time  however  declines in interest rates will reduce the company s interest income
