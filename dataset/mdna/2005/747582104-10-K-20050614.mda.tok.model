item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this annual report on form k  including discussions of our product development plans  business strategies and market factors influencing our results  may include forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ from those anticipated by us as a result of various factors  both foreseen and unforeseen  including  but not limited to  our ability to continue to develop new products and increase systems sales in markets characterized by rapid technological evolution  consolidation  and competition from larger  better capitalized competitors 
many other economic  competitive  governmental and technological factors could impact our ability to achieve our goals  and interested persons are urged to review the risks described in item business 
risk factors as set forth above  as well as in our other public disclosures and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in our entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
historical results of operations  percentage margin fluctuations and any trends that may be inferred from the discussion below are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  uncollectible accounts receivable  and intangible assets  for reasonableness 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill impairment  capitalized software costs and research and development tax credits are among the most critical accounting policies that impact our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that significant accounting policies  as described in note of our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of software licenses  services  hardware  maintenance fees  and edi services 
we currently recognize revenue pursuant to statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as modified by statement of position no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect of certain transactions sop  staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab summarizes the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab modifies certain guidance provided in sab inherent in the revenue recognition process are significant management estimates and judgments  which influence the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
in accordance with the governing revenue recognition guidelines  if the arrangement between vendor and purchaser does not require significant production  modification  or customization of software  revenue should be recognized when all of the following criteria are met o persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  o delivery has occurred  o the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable  and o collectibility is probable 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  the recognition of software license revenue is based on our assessment that the above criteria have been met 
in general  the first two criteria are met with a signed contract and evidence that we have shipped our software to the customer 
we determine that our fee is fixed and determinable based on the contract terms  which specify payment terms tied to specific dates and not to any future deliverables 
probability of collection is based on a credit review of customers 
the timing or amount of revenue recognition may differ if different assessments of the above listed criteria had been made at the time transactions were recorded in revenue 
sop  as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
our determination of the fair value of each element in multi element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
management determines the price of individual elements sold separately using a rolling average of stand alone transactions 
vsoe calculations are reviewed on a quarterly basis 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred at vsoe and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue  net of all discounts 
contract accounting is applied where services include significant software modification  development or customization 
in such instances  the arrangement fee is accounted for in accordance with statement of position no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  whereby the revenue is recognized  generally using the percentage of completion method measured on labor input hours 
the complexity of the estimation process and judgment related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue reported in its consolidated financial statements 
valuation allowances 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain reserves for estimated credit losses 
reserves for potential credit losses are determined by establishing both specific and general reserves 
specific reserves are based on management s estimate of the probability of collection for certain troubled accounts 
general reserves are established based on our historical experience of bad debt expense and the aging of our accounts receivable balances net of deferred revenue and specifically reserved accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
goodwill impairment 
our long lived assets include goodwill of million as of march  and  respectively 
we follow statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the statement applies to the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we no longer amortize amounts related to goodwill 
the balance of goodwill is related to our nextgen division 
under sfas  we are required to perform an annual assessment of the implied fair value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment 
we have compared the fair value of the nextgen division with the carrying amount of assets associated with the division and determined that none of the goodwill recorded as of june  the date of our last annual impairment test was impaired 
the fair value of the nextgen division was determined using a reasonable estimate of future cash flows of the division and a risk adjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows 
there have been no changes that would lead us to believe there is any impairment of the goodwill since the date of the last annual impairment test through march  the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our business segments 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to operations 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
software development costs 
development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
after technological feasibility is established  any additional development costs are capitalized in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed sfas 
such capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the related product  of three years 
we perform an annual review of the recoverability of such capitalized software costs 
at the time a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated cash flows to be generated from the applicable software  any remaining capitalized amounts are written off 
research and development tax credits 
during the year ended march   the company filed amended federal and state tax returns for the fiscal years ended march  through  to take advantage of tax credits related to our research and development activities 
in addition  the company claimed research and development credit on its tax returns for the years ended march   and the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  and accounted for a portion of the aggregate tax credits accumulated through the end of each period due to the uncertainly concerning the ultimate amount of tax to be credited 
as of march   the company had a balance of million in credits which had not been recognized 
in the quarter ended march   the state of california completed an audit of the company s tax returns and did not materially change credits related to research and development 
based on the results of that audit as well the expiration of the statue of limitations on certain amended returns  the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  was reduced by the million in tax credits which had not been recognized as of march management s treatment of research and development tax credits represented a significant estimate which affected the effective income tax rates for the company in the years ending march  and research and development credits taken by the company involve certain assumptions and judgments regarding qualification of expenses under the relevant tax codes 
while the company has received all of federal refunds claimed  none of the credits have been audited by the internal revenue service 
overview of company results o we have experienced significant growth in our total revenue as a result of revenue growth in our nextgen healthcare information services division 
our total company revenue grew on a consolidated basis during the twelve months ended march  versus and in the twelve months ended march  versus o consolidated income from operations grew in the twelve months ended march  versus and in the twelve months ended march  versus this performance was driven in large part by the results in our nextgen division 
o we have benefited and hope to continue to benefit from the increased demands on healthcare providers for greater efficiency and lower costs  as well as increased adoption rates of technology in the healthcare arena 
nextgen division o our nextgen division has experienced significant growth in revenue and operating income 
divisional revenue grew in the twelve months ended march  versus and in the twelve months ended march  versus while divisional operating income excluding unallocated corporate expenses grew in the twelve months end march  and in the twelve months ended march  o during the twelve months ended march   we added staffing resources to departments including sales  marketing  support  implementation  software development  and administration and intend to continue to do so in fiscal year o our goals include continuing to further enhance our existing products  developing new products for targeted markets  continuing to add new customers  selling additional software and services to existing customers and expanding penetration of connectivity services to new and existing customers 
qsi division o our qsi division experienced a revenue decline of in the twelve months ended march  versus and in the twelve months ended march  versus the division experienced a decrease in operating income excluding unallocated corporate expenses in the twelve months ended march  versus o our goals for the qsi division include maximizing revenue and profit performance given the constraints present in this division s target market 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of net revenue represented by each item in our consolidated statements of operations 
year ended march  revenue system sales maintenance  edi  and other services total revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development costs income from operations investment income income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income comparison of the years ended march  and march  for the year ended march   our net income was million or per share on a basic and per share on a fully diluted basis 
in comparison  we earned million or per share on a basic and on a fully diluted basis in the year ended march  the increase in net income for the year ended march   was achieved primarily through the following o a increase in revenue  o an increase in our gross profit margin from to 
revenue 
revenue for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  nextgen division revenue increased from million to approximately million in the period  while qsi division revenue declined by during the period from approximately million to million 
we divide revenue into two categories  system sales and maintenance  edi  and other services 
revenue in the system sales category includes software license fees  third party hardware and software  and implementation and training services related to purchase of the company s software systems 
revenue in the maintenance and other services category includes maintenance  edi  and other revenue 
maintenance and edi revenue are the principle sources of revenue in this category 
system sales 
company wide sales of systems for the twelve months ended march  increased to million from million in the prior year 
our increase in revenue from sales of systems was principally the result of a increase in category revenue at our nextgen division whose sales in this category grew from million during the year ended march  to million during the year ended march  this increase was driven primarily by higher sales of nextgen emr and nextgen epm software to both new and existing clients  as well as an increase in the delivery of related implementation services offset by a decline in the sale of related hardware  third party software and supplies 
systems sales revenue in the qsi division declined to approximately million in the year ended march  from million in the year ended march  the following table breaks down our reported system sales into software  hardware  third party software  supplies  and implementation and training services components by division hardware  third party implementation software and and training total software supplies services system sales twelve months ended march  qsi division  nextgen division     consolidated     twelve months ended march  qsi division   nextgen division     consolidated     nextgen division software revenue increased between the twelve months ended march  and the twelve months ended march  the division s software revenue accounted for of divisional system sales revenue during the twelve months ended march   an increase from in the prior year period 
the increase in software s share of systems sales was not the result of any new trend or change in emphasis on our part relative to software sales 
software license revenue growth continues to be an area of primary emphasis for the nextgen division and management was pleased with the division s performance in this area 
during the twelve months ended march   of nextgen s system sales revenue was represented by hardware and third party software compared to in the same prior year period 
we have noted that the last several quarter s results have included a relatively lower amount of hardware and third party software compared to prior year periods 
however  this decrease was not the result of any change in emphasis on our part 
the number of customers who purchase hardware and third party software and the dollar amount of hardware and third party software revenue fluctuates each year depending on the needs of customers 
the inclusion of hardware and third party software in the division s sales arrangements is typically at the request of the customer and is not a priority focus for us 
implementation and training revenue at the nextgen division increased in the twelve months ended march  compared to the twelve months ended march  implementation and training revenue at the nextgen division increased its share of divisional system sales revenue to in the twelve months ended march  from in the twelve months ended march  the growth in implementation and training revenue is the result of increases in the amount of implementation and training services rendered to our customers 
the amount of implementation and training services revenue and the corresponding rate of growth compared to a prior period in any given year is dependant on several factors including timing of customer implementations  the availability of qualified staff  and the mix of services being rendered 
the number of implementation and training staff increased during the twelve months ended march  versus march  in order to accommodate the increased amount of implementation services sold in conjunction with increased software sales 
in order to achieve continued increased revenue in this area  additional staffing increases are anticipated  though actual future increases in revenue and staff will depend upon the availability of qualified staff  business mix and conditions  and our ability to retain current staff members 
the nextgen division s growth has come in part from investments in sales and marketing activities  including hiring additional sales representatives  trade show attendance  and advertising expenditures 
we have also benefited from winning numerous industry awards for the nextgen division s flagship nextgenemr and nextgenepm software products in fiscal years and  as well as in prior years  and the apparent increasing acceptance of electronic medical records technology in the healthcare industry 
for the qsi division  total system sales decreased in the twelve months ended march  compared to the twelve months ended march  we do not presently foresee any material changes in the business environment for the division with respect to the constrained environment that has been in place for the past several years 
qsi systems sales during the fiscal year ended march  were impacted by year over year declines in hardware and implementation and training services 
maintenance  edi  and other 
company wide revenue from maintenance  edi  and other services grew to million from million 
the increase in this category resulted principally from an increase in maintenance and edi revenue generated from the nextgen division s client base 
total nextgen division maintenance revenue for the year ended march  grew to million from million in the year ago period  while edi revenue grew to million compared to million in the year ago period 
qsi division maintenance revenue declined from million to million in the same period while divisional edi revenue declined by approximately from million to million 
the following table details revenue by category for the twelve month periods ended march  and maintenance edi other total twelve months ended march  qsi division     nextgen division     consolidated     twelve months ended march  qsi division     nextgen division     consolidated     the following table provides the number of billing sites which were receiving maintenance services as of the last business day of the period ended march  and respectively  as well as the number of billing sites receiving edi services during the last month of each respective period at each division of the company 
the table presents summary information only and includes billing entities added and removed for any reason 
note also that a single client may include one or multiple billing sites 
nextgen qsi consolidated maintenance edi maintenance edi maintenance edi march  billing sites added billing sites removed march  cost of revenue 
cost of revenue for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march   while the cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue declined to from during the same period 
our consolidated gross profit is impacted by the level of hardware content included in system sales  the percentage of edi revenue in our overall sales mix  and certain headcount expenses directly related to the cost of delivering our products and services 
consolidated gross profit is also impacted by the higher margin revenues of the nextgen division which increased its share of total company revenue to from in the prior year 
the following table details revenue and cost of revenue on a consolidated and divisional basis for the twelve month periods ended march  and year ended march  consolidated revenue   cost of revenue   gross profit   nextgen division revenue   cost of revenue   gross profit   qsi division revenue   cost of revenue   gross profit   gross profit margins at the nextgen division for the year ended march  increased to from primarily due to a decrease in the proportionate level of hardware and third party software content included in revenue as well as a slight decrease in the relative level of applicable headcount expense associated with delivering our products and services 
the qsi division s gross profit margin improved slightly to in the year ended march  from in the same period last year due to proportionately lower hardware and third party software content included in revenue 
the following table details the individual components of cost of revenue and gross profit as a percentage of total revenue for our company and our two divisions outside services  amortization of hardware  payroll and software third party related development total cost of software benefits costs and other revenue gross profit twelve months ended march  qsi division nextgen division consolidated twelve months ended march  qsi division nextgen division consolidated during the twelve months ended march   hardware and third party software constituted a smaller portion of consolidated revenue compared to the same prior year period  driven principally by the composition of nextgen division revenue 
this year over year reduction was not the result of any identifiable trend or change in emphasis on our part 
the number of customers who purchase hardware and third party software and the dollar amount of hardware and third party software purchased fluctuates each quarter depending on the needs of the customers and is not a priority focus for us 
our payroll and benefits expense associated with delivering our products and services decreased to of consolidated revenue compared to during the prior twelve months ended march  the absolute level of consolidated payroll and benefit expenses grew primarily due to additions to related headcount  payroll and benefits expense associated with delivering products and services in the nextgen division 
payroll and benefits expense associated with delivering products and services in the qsi division declined slightly on an absolute basis  but increased slightly on a percentage of revenue basis 
we anticipate continued additions to headcount in the nextgen division in areas related to delivering products and services in future periods  but due to the uncertainties in the timing of our sales arrangements  our sales mix  the acquisition and training of qualified personnel  and other issues  we cannot accurately predict if related headcount expense as a percentage of revenue will increase or decrease in the future 
we do not currently intend to make any significant additions to related headcount at the qsi division 
should the nextgen division continue to represent an increasing share of our revenue and should the nextgen division continue to carry higher gross margins than the qsi division  our consolidated gross margin percentages should increase to more closely match those of the nextgen division 
as a result of the foregoing events and activities  our gross profit for the company and our two operating divisions increased for the twelve month period ending march  versus the prior year period 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  increased to million as compared to million for the year ended march  the increase resulted primarily from increases of million in selling and administrative salaries and related benefits expenses in the nextgen division  million for corporate related professional services principally in the area of sarbanes oxley compliance  million in commission expense principally in the nextgen division  million in corporate related salaries and related benefit expenses  million in nextgen travel expenses and million in other general and administrative expenses primarily in the nextgen division 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue slightly increased to in the fiscal year ended march  from in the fiscal period ended march  due to selling  general and administrative expenses growing at a slightly faster rate than revenue 
we anticipate increased expenditures for trade shows  advertising and the employment of additional sales representatives primarily at the nextgen division 
we are hopeful that we will be able to achieve at least a moderate reduction in expenses related to sarbanes oxley act compliance 
while we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase on an absolute basis  we cannot accurately predict the impact these additional expenditures will have on selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue 
research and development costs 
research and development costs for the year ended march  and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in research and development costs was primarily due to increased investment in the nextgen product line 
research and development costs as a percentage of net revenue decreased to from primarily due to revenue growing at a faster rate than the increase in research and development spending 
research and development costs are expected to continue at or above current levels 
investment income 
investment income for the year ended march  increased to approximately million compared with million in the year ended march  the increase was primarily due to the effect of an increase in short term interest rates versus the prior year period as well as comparatively higher amounts available for investment during the fiscal period ended march  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company paid a one time dividend of approximately million  which reduced the amount of funds available for investment during this period 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  was approximately million as compared to approximately million for the year ago period 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes for the years ended march  and differ from the combined statutory rates primarily due to the impact of varying state income tax rates and the impact of research and development tax credits 
during fiscal  the company recognized approximately million of research and development credits which had not been recognized previously due to the uncertainly concerning the ultimate amount of tax to be credited 
in the quarter ended march   the state of california completed an audit of the company s tax returns and did not materially change credits related to research and development 
based on the results of that audit as well the expiration of the statue of limitations on certain amended returns  the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  was reduced by the million in tax credits which had not been recognized as of march comparison of the years ended march  and march  for the year ended march   our net income was million or per share on a basic and per share on a fully diluted basis 
in comparison  the company earned million or per share on a basic and per shares on a diluted basis in the year ended march  the increase in net income for the year ended march   was achieved through the following o a increase in revenue  o an increase in our gross profit margin from to  and o selling  general and administrative and research and development expenses which grew at and respectively  slower than the overall revenue growth rate 
revenue 
net revenue for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  sales of computer systems  upgrades and supplies increased to million from million while net revenue from maintenance  edi  and other service grew to from million during the comparable prior period 
the increase in net revenue from sales of computer systems  upgrades and supplies was principally due to increased sales of the company s nextgen epm and nextgen emr software licenses to new customers 
we divide revenue into two categories  system sales and maintenance  edi  and other services 
revenue in the systems sales category includes software license fees  third party hardware and software  and implementation and training services related to purchase of the company s software systems 
revenue in the maintenance and other services category includes maintenance  edi  and other revenue 
maintenance and edi revenue are the principle sources of revenue in this category 
system sales 
company wide sales of systems for the twelve months ended march  increased to million from million in the prior year 
our increase in revenue from sales of systems was principally the result of a increase in category revenue at our nextgen division whose sales in this category grew from million during the year ended march  to million during the year ended march  this increase was driven primarily by higher sales of nextgenemr and nextgenepm software to both new and existing clients  as well as delivery of related implementation services and sales of related hardware  third party software  and supplies

company wide revenue from maintenance  edi  and other services grew to million from million 
the increase in this category resulted principally from an increase in maintenance and edi revenue from the nextgen division s client base 
total nextgen division maintenance revenue for the year ended march  grew to million from million in the year ago period  while edi revenue grew to million compared to million in the same period 
qsi division maintenance revenue declined from million to million in the same period while divisional edi revenue declined by approximately from million to million

our payroll and benefits expense associated with delivering our products and services increased to of consolidated revenue compared to during the prior twelve months ended march  the level of consolidated payroll and benefit expenses grew due to additions to related headcount  payroll and benefits expense associated with delivering products and services in the nextgen division 
payroll and benefits expense associated with delivering products and services in the qsi division increased slightly on both an absolute and a percentage of revenue basis 
we anticipate continued additions to headcount in the nextgen division in areas related to delivering products and services in future periods but due to the uncertainties in the timing of our sales arrangements  our sales mix  the acquisition and training of qualified personnel  and other issues  we cannot accurately predict if related headcount expense as a percentage of revenue will increase or decrease in the future 
we do not currently intend to make any significant additions to related headcount at the qsi division 
our outside services  amortization of software development costs and other expenses included in cost of revenue declined to compared to during the twelve months ended march  this decline was due to a number of factors including a slight decline in the proportion of edi revenue included in consolidated revenue during fiscal  a slight improvement in gross profit related to edi revenue  and certain overhead and amortization of capitalized software costs increasing at a slower rate compared to the rate of revenue growth 
should the nextgen division continue to represent an increasing share of our revenue and should the nextgen division continue to carry higher gross margins than the qsi division  our consolidated gross profit percentages should increase to more closely match those of the nextgen division 
as a result of the foregoing events and activities  our gross profit for the company and our two operating divisions increased for the twelve month period ending march  versus the prior year period 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march   and declined on a percentage of revenue basis to from for the respective fiscal years 
the increase in the amount of such expenses resulted primarily from increases of million in corporate expenses  principally in the area of professional service fees  as well as million in selling and administrative payroll and benefits expenses  million in commissions expenses  and million in travel and trade show expenses primarily in the nextgen division 
further increases in selling  general and administrative expenses are expected 
research and development costs 
research and development costs for the year ended march  and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in research and development costs was primarily due to increased investment in the nextgen product line 
research and development costs as a percentage of net revenue decreased to from due in part  to the fact that revenue growth exceeded the increase in research and development spending  and in part due to the fact that our investments in capitalized software increased to million from million in the prior year  reflecting increased expenditures directed at enhancements of the nextgen products 
research and development costs are expected to continue at or above current levels 
investment income 
investment income for the year ended march  decreased to approximately million compared with million in the year ended march  investment income in the year ended march  declined primarily due to the effect of the drop in short term interest rates versus the prior year 
the decline in interest rates was partially offset by an increase in average funds available for investment during the year ended march  provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  was approximately million as compared to approximately million for the year ago period 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes for the years ended march  and differ from the combined statutory rates primarily due to the impact of varying state income tax rates and the impact of research and development tax credits 
the effective rate for the fiscal year increased from the prior year primarily due to a relatively smaller impact of research and development tax credits as well as slightly higher effective state income tax rates 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  and accounted for a portion of the aggregate tax credits accumulated through the end of each period due to the uncertainly concerning the ultimate amount of tax to be credited 
liquidity and capital resources 
the following table presents selected financial statistics and information for each of the past three fiscal years year ended march  cash and cash equivalents at year end    net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents   net income    net cash provided by operating activities    days of sales outstanding cash provided by operations is our principal source of cash 
cash from operations for the year ended march  consisted principally of net income before non cash related expenses of depreciation  amortization  and provision for bad debts and inventory obsolescence  and increases in deferred revenue and other current liabilities  offset by an increase in gross accounts receivable 
we were able to generate operating cash flows significantly in excess of net income in the year ended march  primarily as a result of increases in deferred revenue of million 
we were able to generate operating cash flows significantly in excess of net income in the year ended march  primarily as a result of increases in deferred revenue of million and improved turnover of accounts receivable 
provided turnover of accounts receivable  increased revenue  and profitability remain consistent with results experienced for the year ended march   we anticipate continuing to generate cash from operations primarily from net income 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended march  was million and was primarily composed of investments in capitalized software and equipment and improvements 
we have no significant capital commitments  and currently anticipate that additions to equipment and improvements for fiscal will be equal to or greater than historical levels 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended march  was million was primarily composed of a one time dividend paid to shareholders of million partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
cash received from employee stock option exercises can fluctuate from year to year 
at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we intend to expend some of these funds for the development of products complementary to our existing product line as well as new versions of certain of our products
