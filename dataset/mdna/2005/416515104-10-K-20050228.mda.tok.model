item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption other operations including asbestos and environmental claims  the hartford continues to receive asbestos and environmental claims that involve significant uncertainty regarding policy coverage issues 
regarding these claims  the hartford continually reviews its overall reserve levels and reinsurance coverages  as well as the methodologies it uses to estimate its exposures 
because of the significant uncertainties that limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses  particularly those related to asbestos  the ultimate liabilities may exceed the currently recorded reserves 
any such additional liability cannot be reasonably estimated now but could be material to the hartford s future consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity

index overview critical accounting estimates consolidated results of operations life retail products group institutional solutions group individual life group benefits property casualty business insurance personal lines specialty commercial other operations including asbestos and environmental claims investments investment credit risk capital markets risk management capital resources and liquidity impact of new accounting standards overview the hartford is a diversified insurance and financial services company with operations dating back to the company is headquartered in connecticut and is organized into two major operations life and property casualty  each containing reporting segments 
in the quarter ended march   and as more fully described below  the company changed its reporting segments to reflect the current manner by which its chief operating decision maker views and manages the business 
all segment data for prior reporting periods have been adjusted to reflect the current segment reporting 
within the life and property casualty operations  the hartford conducts business principally in eight operating segments 
additionally  corporate includes all of the company s debt financing and related interest expense  as well as certain capital raising activities and purchase accounting adjustments 
life includes four reportable operating segments retail products group  institutional solutions group  individual life and group benefits 
through life the company provides investment and retirement products such as variable and fixed annuities  mutual funds and retirement plan services  other institutional investment products  structured settlements  private placement life insurance  individual life insurance products including variable universal life  universal life  interest sensitive whole life and term life  and group benefit products  such as group life and group disability insurance 

table of contents property casualty is organized into four reportable operating segments the underwriting segments of business insurance  personal lines and specialty commercial collectively ongoing operations  and the other operations segment 
through property casualty the company provides a number of coverages  as well as insurance related services  to businesses throughout the united states  including workers compensation  property  automobile  liability  umbrella  specialty casualty  marine  agriculture  bond  professional liability and director s and officer s liability coverages 
property casualty also provides automobile  homeowners  and home based business coverage to individuals throughout the united states  as well as insurance related services to businesses 
many of the principal factors that drive the profitability of the hartford s life and property casualty operations are separate and distinct 
management considers this diversification to be a strength of the hartford that distinguishes the company from its peers 
to present its operations in a more meaningful and organized way  management has included separate overviews within the life and property casualty sections of md a 
for further overview of life s profitability and analysis  see page for further overview of property casualty s profitability and analysis  see page regulatory developments in june  the company received a subpoena from the new york attorney general s office in connection with its inquiry into compensation arrangements between brokers and carriers 
in mid september and subsequently  the company has received additional subpoenas from the new york attorney general s office  which relate more specifically to possible anti competitive activity among brokers and insurers 
since the beginning of october  the company has received subpoenas or other information requests from attorneys general and regulatory agencies in more than a dozen jurisdictions regarding broker compensation and possible anti competitive activity 
the company may receive additional subpoenas and other information requests from attorneys general or other regulatory agencies regarding similar issues 
the company also has received a subpoena from the new york attorney general s office requesting information related to the company s underwriting practices with respect to legal professional liability insurance 
in addition  the company has received a request for information from the new york attorney general s office concerning the company s compensation arrangements in connection with the administration of workers compensation plans 
the company intends to continue cooperating fully with these investigations  and is conducting an internal review  with the assistance of outside counsel  regarding the issues under investigation 
on october   the new york attorney general s office filed a civil complaint against marsh mclennan companies  inc  and marsh  inc 
collectively  marsh 
the complaint alleges  among other things  that certain insurance companies  including the company  participated with marsh in arrangements to submit inflated bids for business insurance and paid contingent commissions to ensure that marsh would direct business to them 
the company is not joined as a defendant in the action 
although no regulatory action has been initiated against the company in connection with the allegations described in the civil complaint  it is possible that the new york attorney general s office or one or more other regulatory agencies may pursue action against the company or one or more of its employees in the future 
the potential timing of any such action is difficult to predict 
if such an action is brought  it could have a material adverse effect on the company 
on october   the new york attorney general s office informed the company that the attorney general is conducting an investigation with respect to the timing of the previously disclosed sale by thomas marra  a director and executive officer of the company  of  shares of the company s common stock on september  the sale occurred shortly after the issuance of two additional subpoenas dated september  by the new york attorney general s office 
the company has engaged outside counsel to review the circumstances related to the transaction and is fully cooperating with the new york attorney general s office 
on the basis of the review  the company has determined that mr 
marra complied with the company s applicable internal trading procedures and has found no indication that mr 
marra was aware of the additional subpoenas at the time of the sale 
there continues to be significant federal and state regulatory activity relating to financial services companies  particularly mutual funds companies 
these regulatory inquiries have focused on a number of mutual fund issues  including market timing and late trading  revenue sharing and directed brokerage  fees  transfer agents and other fund service providers  and other mutual fund related issues 
the company has received requests for information and subpoenas from the securities and exchange commission sec  subpoenas from the new york attorney general s office  requests for information from the connecticut securities and investments division of the department of banking  and requests for information from the new york department of insurance  in each case requesting documentation and other information regarding various mutual fund regulatory issues 
the sec s division of enforcement and the new york attorney general s office are investigating aspects of the company s variable annuity and mutual fund operations related to market timing 
the company s mutual funds are available for purchase by the separate accounts of different variable universal life insurance policies  variable annuity products  and funding agreements  and they are offered directly to certain qualified retirement plans 
although existing products contain transfer restrictions between subaccounts  some products  particularly older variable annuity products  do not contain restrictions on the frequency of transfers 
in addition  as a result of the settlement of litigation against the company with respect to certain owners of older variable annuity products  the company s ability to restrict transfers by these owners is limited 
in february  the company agreed in principle with the boards of directors of the mutual funds to indemnify the mutual funds for any material harm caused to the funds from frequent trading by these owners 
the specific terms of the indemnification have not been determined 
the sec s division of enforcement also is investigating aspects of the company s variable annuity and mutual fund operations related to directed brokerage and revenue sharing 
the company discontinued the use of directed brokerage in recognition of mutual fund sales in late the company also has received a subpoena from the new york attorney general s office requesting information related to the company s group annuity products 
the company continues to cooperate fully with the sec  the new york attorney general s office and other regulatory agencies 

table of contents a number of companies have announced settlements of enforcement actions with various regulatory agencies  primarily the sec and the new york attorney general s office  which have included a range of monetary penalties and restitution 
while no such action has been initiated against the company  the sec  and the new york attorney general s office are likely to take some action at the conclusion of the on going investigations related to market timing and directed brokerage 
the potential timing of any such action is difficult to predict  and the company s ultimate liability  if any  from any such action is not reasonably estimable at this time 
if such an action is brought  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
broker compensation as the company has disclosed previously  the company pays brokers and independent agents commissions and other forms of incentive compensation in connection with the sale of many of the company s insurance products 
since the new york attorney general s office filed a civil complaint against marsh mclennan companies  inc and marsh  inc 
collectively  marsh on october   several of the largest national insurance brokers  including marsh  have announced that they have discontinued the use of contingent compensation arrangements 
other industry participants may make similar  or different  determinations in the future 
in addition  legal  legislative  regulatory  business or other developments may require changes to industry practices relating to incentive compensation 
at this time  it is not possible to predict the effect of these announced or potential changes on the company s business or distribution strategies 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company has identified the following estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability insurance reserves  life operations deferred policy acquisition costs and present value of future profits  the valuation of investments and derivative instruments and the evaluation of other than temporary impairments  pension and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies 
in developing these estimates management makes subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop 
although variability is inherent in these estimates  management believes the amounts provided are appropriate based upon the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements 
reserves life the company s life insurance subsidiaries establish and carry as liabilities  predominantly  three types of reserves a liability for amounts that accrue to the benefit of the policyholder as of the financial statement date  a liability for unpaid claims  including those that have been incurred but not yet reported  and a liability for future policy benefits 
reserves also include amounts for unearned premiums 
reserves for assumed reinsurance are computed in a manner that is comparable to direct insurance reserves 
the company has classified its fixed and variable annuities  k  certain governmental annuities  private placement life insurance  variable universal life insurance  universal life insurance and interest sensitive whole life insurance as universal life type contracts 
the liability for universal life type contracts is equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of the policyholders as of the financial statement date commonly referred to as the account value  including credited interest  amounts that have been assessed to compensate the company for services to be performed over future periods  and any amounts previously assessed against policyholders that are refundable on termination of the contract 
certain contracts classified as universal life type may also include additional death or other insurance benefit features  such as guaranteed minimum death or income benefits offered with variable annuity contracts or no lapse guarantees offered with universal life insurance contracts 
an additional liability is established for these benefits by estimating the expected present value of the benefits in excess of the projected account value in proportion to the present value of total expected assessments 
excess benefits are accrued as a liability as actual assessments are recorded 
determination of the expected value of excess benefits and assessments are based on a range of scenarios and assumptions including those related to market rates of return and volatility  contract surrender rates and mortality experience 
the company has classified its institutional and governmental products  without life contingencies  including funding agreements  structured settlements and guaranteed investment contracts  as investment contracts 
the liability for investment contracts is equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of the contract holder as of the financial statement date  which includes the accumulation of deposits plus credited interest  less withdrawals and amounts assessed through the financial statement date 
liabilities for the company s group life and disability contracts as well its individual term life insurance policies include amounts for unpaid claims and future policy benefits 
liabilities for unpaid claims include estimates of amounts to fully settle known reported claims as well as claims related to insured events that the company estimates have been incurred but have not yet been reported 
liabilities for future policy benefits are calculated by estimating the present value of future policy benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders less the estimated present value of future net premiums 
the methods used in determining the liability for unpaid 
table of contents claims and future policy benefits are standard actuarial methods recognized by the american academy of actuaries 
for the tabular reserves  discount rates are based on the company s earned investment yield and the morbidity mortality tables used are standard industry tables modified to reflect the company s actual experience when appropriate 
in particular  for the company s group disability known claim reserves  the morbidity table for the early durations of claim is based exclusively on the company s experience  incorporating factors such as sex  elimination period and diagnosis 
these reserves are computed such that they are expected to meet the company s future policy obligations 
future policy benefits are computed at amounts that  with additions from estimated premiums to be received and with interest on such reserves compounded annually at certain assumed rates  are expected to be sufficient to meet the company s policy obligations at their maturities or in the event of an insured s death 
changes in or deviations from the assumptions used for mortality  morbidity  expected future premiums and interest can significantly affect the company s reserve levels and related future operations and  as such  provisions for adverse deviation are built into the long tailed liability assumptions 
property casualty the hartford establishes property and casualty reserves to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the company 
these reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported  and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims 
estimating the ultimate cost of future claims and claim adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex process 
this estimation process is based largely on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience  trends and other relevant factors 
reserve estimates can change over time because of unexpected changes in the external environment 
potential external factors include changes in the inflation rate for goods and services related to covered damages such as medical care  hospital care  auto parts  wages and home repair  changes in the general economic environment that could cause unanticipated changes in the claim frequency per unit insured  changes in the litigation environment as evidenced by changes in claimant attorney representation in the claims negotiation and settlement process  changes in the judicial environment regarding the interpretation of policy provisions relating to the determination of coverage and or the amount of damages awarded for certain types of damages  changes in the social environment regarding the general attitude of juries in the determination of liability and damages  changes in the legislative environment regarding the definition of damages and new types of injuries caused by new types of injurious exposure past examples include breast implants  lead paint and construction defects 
reserve estimates can also change over time because of changes in internal company operations 
potential internal factors include periodic changes in claims handling procedures  growth in new lines of business where exposure and loss development patterns are not well established or changes in the quality of risk selection in the underwriting process 
in the case of assumed reinsurance  all of the above risks apply 
in addition  changes in ceding company case reserving and reporting patterns can create additional factors that need to be considered in estimating the reserves 
due to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used  final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates  particularly when those settlements may not occur until well into the future 
the hartford  like other insurance companies  categorizes and tracks its insurance reserves for its segments by line of business  such as property  auto physical damage  auto liability  commercial multi peril package business  workers compensation  general liability and professional liability 
furthermore  the hartford regularly reviews the appropriateness of reserve levels at the line of business level  taking into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims for the subsets of claims in each particular line of business 
in addition  within the other operations segment  the company has reserves for asbestos and environmental a e claims 
adjustments to previously established reserves  which may be material  are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary 
in the judgment of management  information currently available has been properly considered in the reserves established for claims and claim adjustment expenses 
incurred but not reported ibnr reserves represent the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of all claims and the actual reported loss and loss adjustment expenses reported losses 
reported losses represent cumulative loss and loss adjustment expenses paid plus case reserves for outstanding reported claims 
company actuaries evaluate the total reserves ibnr and case reserves on an accident year basis 
an accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is incurred  or  in the case of claims made policies  the calendar year in which a loss is reported 

table of contents the following table shows loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by line of business and by operating segment as of december   net of reinsurance operating segment business personal specialty other total insurance lines commercial operations p c reserve line of business property auto physical damage auto liability package business workers compensation general liability professional liability bond reinsurance

these net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves relate to assumed reinsurance underwritten by reinsurance operations that were moved into other operations in and hartre assumed reinsurance 
reserving for non a e reserves within ongoing and other operations how non a e reserves are set reserves are set by line of business within the various operating segments 
as indicated in the above table  a single line of business may be written in one or more of the segments 
case reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new information becomes known during the course of handling the claim 
lines of business for which loss data eg paid losses and case reserves emerge eg is reported over a long period of time are referred to as long tail lines of business 
lines of business for which loss data emerge more quickly are referred to as short tail lines of business 
within the company s ongoing operations the shortest tail lines of business are property and auto physical damage 
the longest tail lines of business within ongoing operations include workers compensation  general liability  and professional liability 
hartre assumed reinsurance  which is within other operations  is also long tail business 
company actuaries regularly review reserves for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data 
these quarterly reserve reviews incorporate a variety of actuarial methods and judgments and involve rigorous analysis 
for most lines of business  a variety of actuarial methods are reviewed and the actuaries select methods and specific assumptions appropriate for each line of business based on the current circumstances affecting that line of business 
these selections incorporate input from claims personnel  pricing actuaries and operating management on reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates 
for short tail lines of business  emergence of paid loss and case reserves is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses 
the method used to set reserves for these lines incorporates two key assumptions 
the first key assumption is an expected loss ratio for the current accident year 
this loss ratio is determined through a review of prior accident years loss ratios and expected changes to earned pricing  loss costs  mix of business  ceded reinsurance and other factors that are expected to impact the loss ratio for the current accident year 
the second key assumption is a development pattern for reported losses also referred to as the loss emergence pattern 
ibnr reserves for the current year are set as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period  earned premium for the period and the proportion of losses expected to be reported in future calendar periods for the current accident period 
ibnr reserves for prior accident years are similarly determined  again relying on an expected development pattern for reported losses 
for long tail lines of business  emergence of paid losses and case reserves is less credible in the early periods and  accordingly may not be indicative of ultimate losses 
for these lines  methods which incorporate a development pattern assumption are given less weight in calculating ibnr reserves for the early stages of loss emergence because such a low percentage of ultimate losses are reported in that time frame 
accordingly  for any given accident year  the rate at which losses emerge in the early periods is generally not as reliable an indication of the ultimate loss costs as it would be for shorter tail lines of business 
the estimation of reserves for these lines of business in the early stages of loss emergence is therefore largely influenced by prior accident years loss ratios and expected changes to earned pricing  loss costs  mix of business  ceded reinsurance and other factors that are expected to affect the loss ratio 
for later periods of loss emergence  methods which incorporate a development pattern assumption are given more weight in estimating ultimate losses 

table of contents based on the results of the quarterly reserve reviews  the company will determine the appropriate reserve adjustments  if any  to record 
recorded reserve estimates are changed after consideration of numerous factors  including but not limited to  the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves  improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the period  the maturity of the accident year  trends observed over the recent past and the level of volatility within a particular line of business 
in general  changes are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile lines of business 
at year end  total recorded reserves excluding asbestos and environmental were within of the actuarial indication 
annually  as part of the statutory reporting requirements  ibnr is allocated to accident year by statutory line of business 
this work forms the basis for the loss development table and reserve re estimates table shown in the business section 
during there were numerous changes to reserve estimates 
among other loss developments in  these changes included a reduction in estimated ultimate losses associated with september and increases in estimated ultimate losses associated with construction defect claims and hartre assumed reinsurance 
changes in also included increases in the estimated ultimate losses for auto liability and package business in business insurance  as well as a reduction in the expected loss ratio for accident year for bond within specialty commercial 
see reserves within the property and casualty md a for further discussion of reserve developments 
current trends contributing to reserve uncertainty the hartford is a multi line company in the property and casualty business 
the hartford is therefore subject to reserve uncertainty stemming from a number of conditions  including but not limited to those noted above  any of which could be material at any point in time for any segment 
certain issues may become more or less important over time as conditions change 
as various market conditions develop  management must assess whether those conditions constitute a long term trend that should result in a reserving action ie increasing or decreasing the reserve 
below is a discussion of certain market conditions that company management has observed during within the commercial segments and the other operations segment  the company has exposure to claims asserted for bodily injury as a result of long term or continuous exposure to harmful products or substances 
examples include  but are not limited to  pharmaceutical products  latex gloves  silica and lead paint 
the company also has exposure to claims from construction defects  where property damage or bodily injury from negligent construction is alleged 
the company also has exposure to claims asserted against religious institutions and other organizations relating to molestation or abuse 
such exposures may involve potentially long latency periods and may implicate coverage in multiple policy periods 
these factors make reserves for such claims more uncertain than other bodily injury or property damage claims 
with regard to these exposures  the company is monitoring trends in litigation  the external environment  the similarities to other mass torts and the potential impact on the company s reserves 
in personal lines  reserving estimates are generally less variable than for the company s other property and casualty segments 
this is largely due to the coverages having relatively shorter periods of loss emergence 
estimates  however  can still vary due to a number of factors  including interpretations of frequency and severity trends and their impact on recorded reserve levels 
severity trends can be impacted by changes in internal claim handling and reserving practices in addition to changes in the external environment 
these changes in claim practices increase the uncertainty in the interpretation of case reserve data  which increases the uncertainty in recorded reserve levels 
in business insurance  workers compensation is the company s single biggest line of business and the line of business with the longest pattern of loss emergence 
reserve estimates for workers compensation are particularly sensitive to assumptions about medical inflation  which has been increasing steadily over the past few years 
in addition  changes in state legislative and regulatory environments impact the company s estimates 
in particular  the california environment has been very volatile  in part due to reforms intended to reduce loss costs 
it is still uncertain how these reforms will ultimately impact the timing of future payments and the needed amount of reserves 
in the specialty commercial segment  many lines of insurance  such as excess insurance and deductible workers compensation insurance are long tail lines of insurance 
for long tail lines  the period of time between the incidence of the insured loss and either the reporting of the claim to the insurer  the settlement of the claim  or the payment of the claim can be substantial  and in some cases  several years 
as a result of this extended period of time for losses to emerge  reserve estimates for these lines are more uncertain ie more variable than reserve estimates for shorter tail lines of insurance 
estimating required reserve levels for deductible workers compensation insurance is further complicated by the uncertainty of whether losses that are attributable to the deductible amount can be paid by the insured  if such losses are not paid by the insured due to financial difficulties  the company would be contractually liable 
another example of reserve variability relates to reserves for directors and officers insurance 
there is uncertainty in the required level of reserves due to the impact of recent allegations within the financial services industry  including those in the mutual fund  investment banking and insurance industries  as well as due to various highly publicized bankruptcies 
impact of changes in key assumptions on reserve volatility as stated above  the company s practice is to estimate reserves using a variety of methods  assumptions and data elements 
within its reserve estimation process for reserves other than asbestos and environmental  the company does not derive statistical loss distributions or confidence levels around its reserve estimate and  as a result  do not have reserve range estimates to disclose 

table of contents the reserve estimation process includes explicit assumptions about a number of factors in the internal and external environment 
across most lines of business  the most important assumptions are future loss development factors applied to paid or reported losses to date 
for most lines  the reported loss development factor is most important 
in workers compensation  paid loss development factors are also important 
the trend in loss costs is also a key assumption  particularly in the most recent accident years  where loss development factors are less credible 
the following discussion includes disclosure of possible variation from current estimates of loss reserves due to a change in certain key assumptions 
each of the impacts described below is estimated individually  without consideration for any correlation among key assumptions or among lines of business 
therefore  it would be inappropriate to take each of the amounts described below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for the company s reserves in total 
the estimated variation in reserves due to changes in key assumptions is a reasonable estimate of possible variation that may occur in the future  likely over a period of several calendar years 
it is important to note that the variation discussed is not meant to be a worst case scenario  and therefore  it is possible that future variation may be more than amounts discussed below 
recorded reserves for workers compensation  net of reinsurance  are billion  across business insurance and specialty commercial 
the two most important assumptions for workers compensation reserves are loss development factors and loss cost trends  particularly medical cost inflation 
the company has reviewed the historical variation in paid loss development patterns 
if the paid loss development patterns change by  a change that is within historical variation  the estimated reserve need would change by  in either direction 
approximately half of the workers compensation net reserves are related to future medical costs 
a review of national council on compensation insurance ncci data suggests that the annual growth in industry medical claim costs has varied from to since across the entire reserve base  a point change in calendar year medical inflation would change the estimated net reserve by  in either direction 
a change in calendar year medical inflation will impact paid loss development patterns  so the individual variation amounts shown above for a change in paid loss development patterns and a point change in medical inflation should not be added together to determine the combined impact of both changes 
recorded reserves for auto liability  net of reinsurance  are billion across all lines  billion of which is in personal lines 
personal auto liability reserves are shorter tailed than other lines of business such as workers compensation and  therefore  less volatile 
however  the size of the reserve base means that future changes in estimate could be material to the company s results of operations in any given period 
the key assumption for personal lines auto liability is the annual loss cost trend  particularly the severity trend component of loss costs 
a review of insurance services office iso data suggests that annual growth in industry severity since has varied from to 
a point change in assumed annual severity for the two most recent accident years would change the estimated net reserve need by  in either direction 
recorded reserves for general liability  net of reinsurance  are billion across business insurance and specialty commercial 
reported loss development patterns are a key assumption for this line of business  particularly for more mature accident years 
historically  assumptions on reported loss development patterns have been impacted by  among other things  emergence of new types of claims eg construction defect claims or a shift in the mixture between smaller  more routine claims and larger  more complex claims 
the company has reviewed the historical variation in reported loss development patterns 
if the reported loss development patterns change by  a change that is within historical variation  the estimated net reserve need would change by  in either direction 
similar to general liability  hartre assumed casualty reinsurance is affected by reported loss development pattern assumptions 
in addition to the items identified above that would affect both direct and reinsurance liability claim development patterns  there is also an impact to assumed reporting patterns for any changes in claim notification from ceding companies to the reinsurer 
recorded net reserves for hartre assumed reinsurance business  excluding asbestos and environmental liabilities  within other operations were billion as of december  if the development patterns underlying the company s net reserves for hartre assumed casualty reinsurance are incorrect by points  the estimated net reserve need would change by  in either direction 
reserving for asbestos and environmental claims within other operations how a e reserves are set the hartford continues to receive claims that assert damages from asbestos related and environmental related exposures 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up costs 
the hartford wrote several different categories of insurance coverage to which asbestos and environmental claims may apply 
first  the hartford wrote primary policies providing the first layer of coverage in an insured s liability program 
second  the hartford wrote excess policies providing higher layers of coverage for losses that exhaust the limits of underlying coverage 
third  the hartford acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of risks previously assumed by other insurers writing primary  excess and reinsurance coverages 
fourth  the hartford participated in the london market  writing both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business 
in establishing reserves for asbestos claims  the hartford evaluates each insured s estimated liability for such claims using a ground up approach 
the hartford considers a variety of factors  including the jurisdictions where underlying claims have been brought  past  
table of contents pending and anticipated future claim activity  disease mix  past settlement values of similar claims  dismissal rates  allocated claim adjustment expense  and potential bankruptcy impact 
similarly  a ground up exposure review approach is used to establish environmental reserves 
the hartford s evaluation of each insured s estimated liability for environmental claims involves consideration of several factors  including historical values of similar claims  the number of sites involved  the insured s alleged activities at each site  the alleged environmental damage at each site  the respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties at each site  the appropriateness and cost of remediation at each site  the nature of governmental enforcement activities at each site  and potential bankruptcy impact 
having evaluated the insured s probable liability for asbestos and or environmental claims  the hartford then evaluates each insured s insurance coverage program for such claims 
the hartford considers each insured s total available insurance coverage  including the coverage issued by the hartford 
the hartford also considers relevant judicial interpretations of policy language and applicable coverage defenses or determinations  if any 
evaluation of both the insured s estimated liability and the hartford s exposure to the insured depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment 
this analysis is conducted by the company s lawyers and is subject to applicable privileges 
for both asbestos and environmental reserves  the hartford also compares its historical direct net loss and expense paid and incurred experience  and net loss and expense paid and incurred experience year by year  to assess any emerging trends  fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and incurred activity 
once the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and allocated claim adjustment expense is determined for each insured by each policy year  the hartford calculates its ceded reinsurance projection based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance and the company s experience with reinsurance collections 
uncertainties regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves with regard to both environmental and particularly asbestos claims  significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses 
traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of these claims  particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux 
the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures 
in particular  the hartford believes there is a high degree of uncertainty inherent in the estimation of asbestos loss reserves 
in the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures  factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include inadequate loss development patterns  plaintiffs expanding theories of liability  the risks inherent in major litigation  and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines 
furthermore  over time  insurers  including the hartford  have experienced significant changes in the rate at which asbestos claims are brought  the claims experience of particular insureds  and the value of claims  making predictions of future exposure from past experience uncertain 
for example  in the past few years  insurers in general  including the hartford  have experienced an increase in the number of asbestos related claims due to  among other things  plaintiffs increased focus on new and previously peripheral defendants  and an increase in the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities 
plaintiffs and insureds have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings  including pre packaged bankruptcies  to accelerate and increase loss payments by insurers 
in addition  some policyholders have asserted new classes of claims for so called non products coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not apply 
further uncertainties include insolvencies of other carriers and unanticipated developments pertaining to the hartford s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims 
management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
in the case of the reserves for environmental exposures  factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include expanding theories of liabilities and damages  the risks inherent in major litigation  inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims  and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured 
it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims 
it is unknown whether potential federal asbestos related legislation will be enacted  and if so  what its effect will be on the hartford s aggregate asbestos liabilities 
the reporting pattern for assumed reinsurance claims is much longer than for direct claims 
in many instances  it takes months or years to determine that the policyholder s own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in question may apply to such claims 
the delay in reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves 
given the factors and emerging trends described above  the hartford believes the actuarial tools and other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for its asbestos and environmental exposures 
for this reason  the hartford relies on an exposure based analysis to estimate the ultimate costs of these claims and regularly evaluates new information in assessing its potential asbestos and environmental exposures 
the variability of estimates for asbestos and environmental reserves is affected by a number of factors including assumptions with respect to the frequency of claims  the average severity of those claims settled with payment  the dismissal rate of claims with no payment and the expense to indemnity ratio 
the uncertainty with respect to the underlying reserve assumptions for asbestos and 
table of contents environmental adds a greater degree of variability and risk to these reserve estimates than reserve estimates for more traditional exposures 
while this variability is reflected in part in the size of the range of reserves developed by the company  that range may still not be indicative of the potential variance between the ultimate outcome and the recorded reserves 
the recorded net reserves as of december  of billion billion and for asbestos and environmental  respectively is within an estimated range  unadjusted for covariance  of billion to billion 
the process of estimating asbestos and environmental reserves remains subject to a wide variety of uncertainties  which are detailed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
due to these uncertainties  further developments could cause the hartford to change its estimates and ranges of its asbestos and environmental reserves  and the effect of these changes could be material to the company s consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in the opinion of management  based upon the known facts and current law  the reserves recorded for the hartford s property and casualty businesses at december  represent the company s best estimate of its ultimate liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses related to losses covered by policies written by the company 
however  because of the significant uncertainties surrounding environmental  and particularly asbestos exposures  it is possible that management s estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change and that the required adjustment to recorded reserves could exceed the currently recorded reserves by an amount that could be material to the hartford s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
valuation of investments and derivative instruments and evaluation of other than temporary impairments the hartford s investments in fixed maturities  which include bonds  redeemable preferred stock and commercial paper  and certain equity securities  which include common and non redeemable preferred stocks  are classified as available for sale as defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 

accordingly  these securities are carried at fair value with the after tax difference from amortized cost  as adjusted for the effect of deducting the life and pension policyholders share of the immediate participation guaranteed contracts and certain life and annuity deferred policy acquisition costs  reflected in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
the equity investments associated with the variable annuity products offered in japan are recorded at fair value and are classified as trading as defined in sfas no 
 with changes in fair value recorded in net investment income 
policy loans are carried at outstanding balance  which approximates fair value 
other investments primarily consist of limited partnership interests  derivatives and mortgage loans 
the limited partnerships are accounted for under the equity method and accordingly the company s share of partnership earnings are included in net investment income 
derivatives are carried at fair value and mortgage loans on real estate are recorded at the outstanding principal balance adjusted for amortization of premiums or discounts and net of valuation allowances  if any 
valuation of fixed maturities the fair value for fixed maturity securities is largely determined by one of three primary pricing methods independent third party pricing service market quotations  independent broker quotations or pricing matrices  which use data provided by external sources 
with the exception of short term securities for which amortized cost is predominantly used to approximate fair value  security pricing is applied using a hierarchy or waterfall approach whereby prices are first sought from independent pricing services with the remaining unpriced securities submitted to brokers for prices or lastly priced via a pricing matrix 
prices from independent pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions 
as a result  certain of the company s asset backed and commercial mortgage backed securities are priced via broker quotations 
a pricing matrix is used to price securities for which the company is unable to obtain either a price from an independent third party service or an independent broker quotation 
the pricing matrix begins with current treasury rates and uses credit spreads and issuer specific yield adjustments received from an independent third party source to determine the market price for the security 
the credit spreads incorporate the issuer s credit rating as assigned by a nationally recognized rating agency and a risk premium  if warranted  due to the issuer s industry and the security s time to maturity 
the issuer specific yield adjustments  which can be positive or negative  are updated twice annually  as of june and december  by an independent third party source and are intended to adjust security prices for issuer specific factors 
the matrix priced securities at december  and  primarily consisted of non a private placements and have an average duration of and  respectively

table of contents the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable  unrelated willing parties 
as such  the estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ significantly from the amount that could be realized if the security was sold immediately 
valuation of derivative instruments derivative instruments are reported at fair value based upon either independent market quotations or pricing valuation models which utilize independent third party data as inputs 
other than the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb and the associated reinsurance contracts  which are discussed below  approximately of derivatives  based upon notional values  were priced via valuation models and the remaining of derivatives were priced via independent market quotations 
other than temporary impairments one of the significant estimations inherent in the valuation of investments is the evaluation of other than temporary impairments 
the evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process  which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings 
the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions  the issuer s financial condition or near term recovery prospects and the effects of changes in interest rates 
the company s accounting policy requires that a decline in the value of a security below its amortized cost basis be assessed to determine if the decline is other than temporary 
if the security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  a charge is recorded in net realized capital losses equal to the difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security 
in addition  for securities expected to be sold  an other than temporary impairment charge is recognized if the company does not expect the fair value of a security to recover to amortized cost prior to the expected date of sale 
the fair value of the other than temporarily impaired investment becomes its new cost basis 
the company has a security monitoring process overseen by a committee of investment and accounting professionals the committee that identifies securities that  due to certain characteristics  as described below  are subjected to an enhanced analysis on a quarterly basis 
securities not subject to emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets non eitf issue no 
securities  that are in an unrealized loss position  are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if an other than temporary impairment is present based on certain quantitative and qualitative factors 
the primary factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value for non eitf issue no 
securities is other than temporary include a the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  b the financial condition  credit rating and near term prospects of the issuer  c whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments and d the intent and ability of the company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery 
non eitf issue no 
securities depressed by twenty percent or more for six months are presumed to be other than temporarily impaired unless significant objective verifiable evidence supports that the security price is temporarily depressed and is expected to recover within a reasonable period of time 
the evaluation of non eitf issue no 
securities depressed more than ten percent is documented and discussed quarterly by the committee 
for certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows including asset backed securities  eitf issue no 
requires the company to periodically update its best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security 
if the fair value of a securitized financial asset is less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the last revised estimate  considering both timing and amount  then an other than temporary impairment charge is recognized 
estimating future cash flows is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third party sources along with certain internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral 
as a result  actual results may differ from current estimates 
in addition  projections of expected future cash flows may change based upon new information regarding the performance of the underlying collateral 
once an impairment charge has been recorded  the company continues to review the other than temporarily impaired securities for additional other than temporary impairments 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the financial accounting standards board fasb voted to delay the implementation of the impairment measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs of eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairments and its application to certain investments eitf issue no 
 in order to redeliberate certain aspects of the consensus 
the ultimate completion of eitf issue no 
may impact the company s current other than temporary impairment evaluation process 
valuation of guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit derivatives an embedded derivative instrument is reported at fair value based upon internally established valuations that are consistent with external valuation models  quotations furnished by dealers in such instruments or market quotations 
the company has calculated the fair value of the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb embedded derivative based on actuarial assumptions related to the projected cash flows  including benefits and related contract charges  over the lives of the contracts  incorporating expectations concerning policyholder behavior 
because of the dynamic and complex nature of these cash flows  stochastic techniques under a variety of market return scenarios and other best estimate assumptions are used 
estimating these cash flows involves numerous estimates and subjective judgments including those regarding expected market rates of return  market volatility  correlations of market returns and discount rates 
at each valuation date  the company assumes expected returns based on risk free rates as represented by the current libor forward curve rates  market volatility assumptions for each underlying index based on a blend of observed market 
table of contents implied volatility data and annualized standard deviations of monthly returns using the most recent years of observed market performance  correlations of market returns across underlying indices based on actual observed market returns and relationships over the ten years preceding the valuation date  and current risk free spot rates as represented by the current libor spot curve to determine the present value of expected future cash flows produced in the stochastic projection process 
life deferred policy acquisition costs and present value of future profits policy acquisition costs include commissions and certain other expenses that vary with and are primarily associated with acquiring business 
present value of future profits is an intangible asset recorded upon applying purchase accounting in an acquisition of a life insurance company 
deferred policy acquisition costs and the present value of future profits intangible asset are amortized in the same way 
both are amortized over the estimated life of the contracts acquired  usually years 
within the following discussion  deferred policy acquisition costs and the present value of future profits intangible asset will be referred to as dac 
at december  and  the carrying value of life s dac was billion and billion  respectively 
for statutory accounting purposes  such costs are expensed as incurred 
dac related to traditional policies are amortized over the premium paying period in proportion to the present value of annual expected premium income 
dac related to investment contracts and universal life type contracts are deferred and amortized using the retrospective deposit method 
under the retrospective deposit method  acquisition costs are amortized in proportion to the present value of estimated gross profits egps  arising principally from projected investment  mortality and expense margins and surrender charges 
the attributable portion of the dac amortization is allocated to realized gains and losses on investments 
the dac balance is also adjusted through other comprehensive income by an amount that represents the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs that would have been required as a charge or credit to operations had unrealized gains and losses on investments been realized 
actual gross profits can vary from management s estimates  resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of amortization 
life regularly evaluates its egps to determine if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
in the event that life were to revise its egps  the cumulative dac amortization would be adjusted to reflect such revised egps in the period the revision was determined to be necessary 
several assumptions considered to be significant in the development of egps include separate account fund performance  surrender and lapse rates  estimated interest spread and estimated mortality 
the separate account fund performance assumption is critical to the development of the egps related to life s variable annuity and to a lesser extent  variable universal life insurance businesses 
the average annual long term rate of assumed separate account fund performance before mortality and expense charges used in estimating gross profits for the variable annuity and variable universal life business was for the years ended december  and for other products including fixed annuities and other universal life type contracts  the average assumed investment yield ranged from to for both years ended december  and life had developed models to evaluate its dac asset  which allowed it to run a large number of stochastically determined scenarios of separate account fund performance 
these scenarios were then utilized to calculate a statistically significant range of reasonable estimates of egps 
this range was then compared to the present value of egps currently utilized in the dac amortization model 
as of december   the present value of the egps utilized in the dac amortization model fall within a reasonable range of statistically calculated present value of egps 
as a result  life does not believe there is sufficient evidence to suggest that a revision to the egps and therefore  a revision to the dac as of december  is necessary  however  if in the future the egps utilized in the dac amortization model were to fall outside of the margin of the reasonable range of statistically calculated egps  a revision could be necessary 
furthermore  life has estimated that the present value of the egps is likely to remain within a reasonable range if overall separate account returns decline by or less over the next twelve months  and if certain other assumptions that are implicit in the computations of the egps are achieved 
additionally  life continues to perform analyses with respect to the potential impact of a revision to future egps 
if such a revision to egps were deemed necessary  life would adjust  as appropriate  all of its assumptions for products accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments  and reproject its future egps based on current account values at the end of the quarter in which a revision is deemed to be necessary 
to illustrate the effects of this process  assume life had concluded that a revision of life s egps was required at december  if life assumed a average long term rate of growth from december  forward along with other appropriate assumption changes in determining the revised egps  life estimates the cumulative decrease to amortization would be approximately  after tax 
if instead life were to assume a long term growth rate of in determining the revised egps  the adjustment would be approximately  after tax 
any such adjustment would not affect statutory income or surplus  due to the prescribed accounting for such amounts that is discussed above 
aside from absolute levels and timing of market performance assumptions  additional factors that will influence this determination include the degree of volatility in separate account fund performance and shifts in asset allocation within the separate account made by policyholders 
the overall return generated by the separate account is dependent on several factors  including the relative mix of the underlying sub accounts among bond funds and equity funds as well as equity sector weightings 
life s overall separate account fund performance has been reasonably correlated to the overall performance of the s p index which closed at  on december   although no assurance can be provided that this correlation will continue in the future 
the overall recoverability of the dac asset is dependent on the future profitability of the business 
life tests the aggregate recoverability of the dac asset by comparing the amounts deferred to the present value of total egps 
in addition  life routinely 
table of contents stress tests its dac asset for recoverability against severe declines in its separate account assets  which could occur if the equity markets experienced another significant sell off  as the majority of policyholders funds in the separate accounts is invested in the equity market 
as of december   life believed variable annuity separate account assets could fall by at least before portions of its dac asset would be unrecoverable 
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations pursuant to accounting principles related to the company s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations to employees under its various benefit plans  the company is required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the related liabilities and expenses each period 
the two economic assumptions that have the most impact on pension expense are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate assumption  the company utilizes current market information provided by its plan actuaries  including a discounted cash flow analysis of the company s pension obligation and general movements in the current market environment 
in particular  the company uses an interest rate yield curve developed by its plan actuaries 
the yield curve is comprised of bonds rated aa or higher with maturities primarily between zero and thirty years 
based on all available information  it was determined that was the appropriate discount rate as of december  to calculate the company s accrued benefit liability 
accordingly  the discount rate will also be used to determine the company s pension expense 
at december   the discount rate was 
the company determines the long term rate of return assumption for the pension plan s asset portfolio based on analysis of the portfolio s historical rates of return balanced with future long term return expectations 
based on its long term outlook with respect to the markets  the company maintained its long term rate of return assumption at as of december  to illustrate the impact of these assumptions on annual pension expense for and going forward  a basis point change in the discount rate will increase decrease pension expense by approximately and a basis point change in the long term asset return assumption will increase decrease pension expense by approximately contingencies management follows the requirements of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
this statement requires management to evaluate each contingent matter separately 
a loss is recorded if estimable and probable 
management establishes reserves for these contingencies at its best estimate  or  if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other  the company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the range of losses 
the majority of contingencies currently being evaluated by the company relate to litigation matters  which are inherently difficult to evaluate and subject to significant changes

the company derives its revenues principally from a fee income  including asset management fees  on separate account and mutual fund assets and mortality and expense fees  as well as cost of insurance charges  b net investment income on general account assets  c fully insured premiums  and d certain other fees 
asset management fees and mortality and expense fees are primarily generated from separate account assets  which are deposited with the company through the sale of variable annuity and variable universal life products and from mutual funds 
cost of insurance charges are assessed on the net amount at risk for investment oriented life insurance products 
premium revenues are derived primarily from the sale of group life  and group disability and individual term insurance products 
the company s expenses essentially consist of interest credited to policyholders on general account liabilities  insurance benefits provided  amortization of the deferred policy acquisition costs  expenses related to the selling and servicing the various products offered by the company  dividends to policyholders  and other general business expenses 

table of contents the company s profitability in its variable annuity  mutual fund and to a lesser extent  variable universal life businesses depends largely on the amount of the contract holder account value or assets under management on which it earns fees and the level of fees charged 
changes in account value or assets under management are driven by two main factors net flows  which measure the success of the company s asset gathering and retention efforts  and the market return of the funds  which is heavily influenced by the return on the equity markets 
net flows are comprised of new sales and other deposits less surrenders  death benefits  policy charges and annuitizations of investment type contracts  for instance  variable annuity contracts 
in the mutual fund business  net flows are known as net sales 
net sales are comprised of new sales less redemptions of mutual fund customers 
the company uses the average daily value of the s p index as an indicator for evaluating market returns of the underlying account portfolios in the united states 
relative profitability of variable products is highly correlated to the growth in account values or assets under management since these products generally earn fee income on a daily basis 
thus  a prolonged downturn in the financial markets could reduce revenues and potentially raise the possibility of a charge against deferred policy acquisition costs 
the profitability of the company s fixed annuities and other spread based products depends largely on its ability to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on its general account assets and interest credited to policyholders 
profitability is also influenced by operating expense management including the benefits of economies of scale in the administration of its united states variable annuity businesses in particular 
in addition  the size and persistency of gross profits from these businesses is an important driver of earnings as it affects the rate of amortization of the deferred policy acquisition costs 
the company s profitability in its individual life insurance and group benefits businesses depends largely on the size of its in force block  the adequacy of product pricing and underwriting discipline  actual mortality and morbidity experience  and the efficiency of its claims and expense management 
performance measures fee income fee income is largely driven from amounts collected as a result of contractually defined percentages of assets under management on investment type contracts 
these fees are generally collected on a daily basis from the contract holder s account 
for individual life insurance products  fees are contractually defined percentages based on levels of insurance  age  premiums and deposits collected and contractholder account value 
life insurance fees are generally collected on a monthly basis 
therefore  the growth in assets under management either through positive net flows or net sales and favorable equity market performance will have a favorable impact on fee income 
conversely  negative net flows or net sales and unfavorable equity market performance will reduce fee income generated from investment type contracts

in addition  insurance type contracts such as those sold by the group benefits segment collect premiums discussed below for protection from losses specified in the particular insurance contract 
these deposits and premiums together comprise the majority of the assets of the general account that are invested to generate investment income for the company 
the investment type contracts use this investment income to credit the contract holder an amount of interest specified in the respective contract 
as discussed in the overview  the amount of investment income earned in excess of the interest credited to the contract holder is the spread income earned by the company 
for insurance type contracts  net investment income earned during the time that premiums are invested prior to paying claims and expenses supports the profitability of these products

the increase in net investment income for the group benefits segment was primarily due to the acquisition of the group benefits business of cna at december  premiums as discussed above  traditional insurance type products collect premiums from policyholders in exchange for financial protection of the policy holder from a specified insurable loss  such as death or disability 
these premiums together with net investment income earned from the overall investment strategy are used to pay the contractual obligations under these insurance contracts 
two major factors  new sales and persistency  impact premium growth 
sales can increase or decrease in a given year based on a number of factors  including but not limited to  customer demand for the company s product offerings  pricing competition  distribution channels and the company s reputation and ratings 
a majority of sales correspond with the open enrollment periods of employers benefits  typically january or july persistency is a measure of business retention during a renewal period 
for the years ended group benefits segment total premiums and other considerations fully insured ongoing sales persistency 

the persistency rate represents the employer group life and disability business  which accounts for of inforce premiums  excluding the cna acquisition 
for comparability purposes  the persistency rate excludes the cna acquisition 
the significant increase in premiums for the group benefits segment in compared to is the result of the earned premium growth as the result of the cna acquisition as well as in the pre acquisition group benefits business 
the increase in earned premiums of the pre acquisition group benefits business was driven by sales and favorable persistency 
expenses there are three major categories for expenses 
the first major category of expenses is benefits and claims 
these include the costs of mortality and morbidity  particularly in the group benefits  and mortality in the individual life businesses  as well as other contractholder benefits to policyholders 
in addition  traditional insurance type products generally use a loss ratio which is expressed as the amount of benefits incurred during a particular period divided by total premiums and other considerations  as a key indicator of underwriting performance 
since the group benefits segment occasionally buys a block of claims for a stated premium amount  the company excludes this buyout from the loss ratio used for evaluating the underwriting results of the business as buyouts may distort the loss ratio 
the second major category is insurance operating costs and expenses  which is commonly expressed in a ratio of a revenue measure depending on the type of business 
the third category is the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and the present value of future profits  which is typically expressed as a percentage of pre tax income before the cost of this amortization 
the individual annuity business within the retail products group segment accounts for the majority of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and present value of future profits for the company

as part of the cna acquisition  a larger block of affinity business is now included in the group benefits segment and this business typically has lower expected loss ratios and higher expected commission ratios than other products within the business 
profitability management evaluates the rates of return various businesses can provide as a way of determining where additional capital is invested to increase net income and shareholder returns 
specifically  because of the importance of its individual annuity products  the company uses the return on assets for the individual annuity business for evaluating profitability

with the adoption of sop  certain annuity and individual life products were required to be accounted for in the general account 
this change in accounting resulted in an increase of  in net investment income  an increase of  in benefits  claims and claim adjustment expenses and a decrease of in other revenues for the year ended december   respectively 

for the years ended december   represents the cumulative impact of the company s adoption of sop life changed its reportable operating segments in from investment products  individual life  group benefits and corporate owned life insurance coli to retail products group retail  institutional solutions group institutional  individual life and group benefits 
retail offers individual variable and fixed annuities  mutual funds  retirement plan products and services to corporations under section k plans and other investment products

periodic net coupon settlements on non qualifying derivatives and net realized capital gains 
table of contents and losses related to guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits are reflected in each applicable segment in net realized capital gains and losses 
compared to life s net income increased due primarily to business growth in virtually all lines of business as discussed below  a lower effective income tax rate  and higher net realized capital gains

net income in the retail segment increased  principally driven by growth in the variable annuity and mutual fund businesses as a result of increasing assets under management 
partially offsetting the increase in the retail segment was lower spread income on market value adjusted mva fixed annuities due to the adoption of sop net income in the group benefits segment increased due primarily to increased earned premiums and net investment income growth  primarily resulting from the company s acquisition of the group life and accident  and short term and long term disability businesses of cna financial corporation cna acquisition 
in addition  the group benefits segment was impacted by favorable persistency in most businesses and lower benefit costs in the group life line 
net income in the institutional segment was higher as a result of a decrease in other expenses related to private placement life insurance business compared to the respective prior year period 
the decrease in other expenses for the current year is attributed to a after tax charge  recorded in the third quarter ended september   associated with the settlement of the bancorp services  llc bancorp litigation 
additionally  net income was higher for individual life and the international operations 
the increase in individual life earnings was primarily driven by improved net investment spread income including the effects of prepayments and growth in account values and life insurance in force 
net income for the international operations  which is included in the other category  increased over the prior year primarily driven by the increase in assets under management of the japan annuity business 
japan s assets under management have grown to billion at december  from billion at december  during  the company introduced market value adjusted fixed annuity products to provide a diversified product portfolio to customers in japan 
the effective tax rate was for life operations for the current year as compared to an effective tax rate of for life operations for the respective prior year period 
the lower effective tax rate was attributed to tax related items  as discussed above  of and a tax year drd benefit of  as compared to tax related items of and a tax year drd benefit of reported for the years ended december  and  respectively 
slightly offsetting the positive earnings drivers for the year ended december  was the cumulative effect of accounting change from the company s adoption of sop the adoption of sop also resulted in certain changes in presentation in the company s financial statements  including reporting of the spreads on the company s mva fixed annuities and variable annuity products offered in japan on a gross basis in net investment income and benefits expense 
exclusive of the cumulative effect  overall application of sop resulted in an immaterial reduction in net income 
for further discussion of the impact of the company s adoption of sop  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
compared to net income increased for the year ended december  due primarily to the growth in the retail segment and a decrease in net realized capital losses compared to the earnings growth in the retail segment is due to an increase in fee income and net investment income 
fee income in the retail segment was higher in compared to  as a result of higher average account values  specifically in individual annuities and mutual fund businesses  due primarily to stronger variable annuity sales as well as market appreciation 
net investment income in retail increased due to higher general account assets in the individual annuity business 
also contributing to the net income growth was higher earnings in group benefits  primarily due to increases in earned premiums and favorable claims 
additionally  individual life experienced earnings growth due to increases in fees and cost of insurance as life insurance in force grew and aged  and variable universal life account values increased due primarily to the growth in the equity markets and favorable mortality 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in institutional net income for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year period 
this decrease is attributed to a after tax charge  recorded in the third quarter of associated with the settlement of the bancorp litigation 
in addition  there was an after tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of related to favorable development on the company s estimated september exposure 
the effective tax rate increased in when compared with as a result of higher earnings and lower drd related tax items 
the tax provision recorded during reflects a benefit of  consisting primarily of a change in estimate of the drd tax benefit reported during the change in estimate was the result of actual investment performance on the related separate accounts being unexpectedly out of pattern with past performance  which had been the basis for the estimate

table of contents markets as well as each segment s ability to attract new customers and attract and retain assets under management 
please refer to each segment s results for outlooks on specific segments and products 
also contributing to the company s performance in was increased earnings in the other category  which was primarily the result of the growth in assets under management in the international operations 
this growth was driven by record sales of billion and positive net flows in japan  which combined with gains in the equity market increased assets under management to billion at december  from billion at december  although the company s international operations experienced significant growth during  japanese regulations combined with competition could adversely affect the company s ability to exceed or sustain the level of new sales and net flows attained in a description of each segment as well as an analysis of the operating results summarized above is included on the following pages

the retail products group segment focuses on the savings and retirement needs of the growing number of individuals who are preparing for retirement  or have already retired  through the sale of individual variable and fixed annuities  mutual funds  retirement plan services and other investment products 
the company is both a leading writer of individual variable annuities and a top seller of individual variable annuities through banks in the united states 
compared to net income increased for the year ended december   principally driven by higher fee income from double digit growth in the assets under management in virtually all businesses of the segment and strong expense management 
fee income generated by the variable annuity operation increased  as average account values were higher in the current year compared to the respective prior year periods 
the increase in average account values can be attributed to market appreciation of billion and net flows of billion during another contributing factor to the increase in fee income was the increase in assets under management in the mutual fund and k businesses 
retail mutual fund assets under management increased principally due to net sales and market appreciation of billion each during in addition  k assets under management grew to billion as a result of favorable net flows and market conditions 
partially offsetting the positive earnings drivers discussed above were higher dac amortization costs  lower income from the fixed annuity business and the cumulative effect of accounting change from the company s adoption of sop dac amortization was higher in the current year as compared to the prior year due to higher subsequent deposit activity  primarily in individual annuity 
the decrease in net income in the fixed annuity business in compared to was principally due to lower investment spread from the market value adjusted mva product 
with the adoption of sop  the company includes the investment return from the fixed annuity product in net investment income and includes interest credited to contract holders in the benefits  claims and expenses line on the income statement rather than reporting the net spread in fee income and other 
additionally  income tax expense was higher for the current year due primarily to higher income earned by the segment 
this increase was largely offset by a higher drd 
table of contents tax benefit of related to the tax year reported for the year ended december   as discussed above  as compared to the drd tax benefit of related to the tax year reported in the comparable prior year period 
compared to net income was higher driven by an increase in revenues in the individual annuity and other retail product operations as a result of the strong net flows and growth in the equity markets during and strong expense management 
net income increased due to an increase in fee income in retail 
fee income in retail was higher in compared to  as a result of higher average account values  specifically in individual annuities and mutual fund businesses  due primarily to stronger variable annuity sales and the higher equity market values compared to the prior year 
net investment income increased due to higher general account assets 
general account assets for the individual annuity business were billion as of december   an increase of approximately or from  due primarily to an increase in individual annuity sales  with the majority of those new sales electing to use the dollar cost averaging dca feature 
the dca feature allows policyholders to earn a credited interest rate in the general account for a defined period of time as their invested assets are systematically invested into the separate account funds 
additionally  there was increased interest credited in the individual annuity operation as a result of higher general account asset levels and an increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs related to the individual annuity business due to higher gross profits 
in addition  net income increased in compared to due to the favorable impact of  resulting from the company s previously discussed change in estimate of the drd tax benefit reported during the change in estimate was the result of actual investment performance on the related separate accounts being unexpectedly out of pattern with past performance  which had been the basis for the estimate 
the total drd benefit related to the tax year for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  outlook management believes the market for retirement products continues to expand as individuals increasingly save and plan for retirement 
demographic trends suggest that as the baby boom generation matures  a significant portion of the united states population will allocate a greater percentage of their disposable incomes to saving for their retirement years due to uncertainty surrounding the social security system and increases in average life expectancy 
individual annuity sales in were billion a decrease compared to billion in  and k products experienced an increase of in sales in compared to significantly contributing to the company s variable annuity sales during and was principal first  a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb rider  which was developed in response to our customers needs 
however  competition has increased substantially in this market with most major variable annuity writers now offering gmwb riders and as a result  the company may not be able to sustain the level of sales attained in in an effort to meet diverse customer needs  in the fourth quarter of the company introduced principal first preferred  a lower cost gmwb alternative to principal first 
the success of this new product will ultimately be based on customer acceptance 
according to vards  the company had market share as of december  as compared to at december  with the increased competition in the variable annuity market causing lower sales levels from the record level in  combined with an aging block of business  net flows may decline from levels experienced in this will be largely dependent on the company s ability to retain contractholder s account values as they reach the end of the surrender charge period of their contract 
in addition  net flows in the company s fixed annuity block may be impacted by approximately billion of contracts reaching renewal dates in at crediting rates significantly above those offered currently 
the growth and profitability of the individual annuity and mutual fund businesses is dependent to a large degree on the performance of the equity markets 
in periods of favorable equity market performance  the company may experience stronger sales and higher net flows  which will increase assets under management and thus increase fee income earned on those assets 
in addition  higher equity market levels will generally reduce certain costs to the company of individual annuities  such as guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb and gmwb benefits 
conversely  weak equity markets may dampen sales activity and increase surrender activity causing declines in assets under management and lower fee income 
such declines in the equity markets will also increase the cost to the company of gmdb and gmwb benefits associated with individual annuities 
the company attempts to mitigate some of the volatility associated with the gmdb and gmwb benefits using reinsurance or other risk management strategies  such as hedging 
future net income for the company will be affected by the effectiveness of the risk management strategies the company has implemented to mitigate the net income volatility associated with the gmdb and gmwb benefits of variable annuity contracts 
for spread based products sold in the retail segment  the future growth will depend on the ability to earn targeted returns on new business given competition  retention of account values in the fixed annuity business where the contract holder s rate guarantee expires in the upcoming year  and the future interest rate environment

compared to net income for the year ended december  increased primarily due to decreases in other expenses related to ppli business compared to the prior year 
the decrease in other expenses was primarily attributed to a after tax charge  recorded in the third quarter ended september   associated with the settlement of the bancorp litigation 
in addition  the governmental business contributed higher income for the current year 
this increase was primarily attributable to higher revenues earned from the growth in the average account values as a result of positive net flows and market appreciation since the prior year coupled with improved spreads and expense management 
partially offsetting increases in segment net income for the current year was lower income from the iip and ppli businesses  excluding the settlement of the bancorp litigation 
for a discussion of the bancorp litigation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in net income in the iip was due primarily to lower spread income and slightly higher insurance operating costs for the year ended december  as compared to in addition  the iip reported lower earnings for the current year compared to the prior year due to favorable mortality experience in ppli also experienced lower earnings for the year ended december  as compared to due to lower average leveraged coli account values

other expenses increased due primarily to a after tax expense  related to the bancorp litigation expense recorded in compared with the after tax expense recorded in excluding the expenses associated with the bancorp litigation  net income increased or  primarily due to higher income in the institutional investment products business as a result of favorable mortality experience and growth in average assets over the last twelve months 
general account assets under management related to the iip increased since december   to billion as of december  the increase in general account assets was primarily due to higher net flows and market appreciation related to institutional annuities and structured settlement products 
partially offsetting the increase in earnings in the iip was lower ppli income due to the decline in leveraged coli account values as a result of surrender activity and lower sales volume of ppli products in as compared to the prior year 
in addition  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased as a result of higher sales in the institutional investment products business 

table of contents outlook the future net income of this segment will depend on the company s ability to increase assets under management and maintain its investment spread earnings on the majority of the products sold in largely the iip and government businesses 
these markets are highly competitive from a pricing perspective  and a small number of cases often account for a significant portion of sales  therefore the company may not be able to sustain the level of assets under management growth attained in in  iip introduced the hartford income notes  a new funding agreement backed product that provides the company with opportunity for future growth 
this product provides access to both a multi billion dollar retail market  and a nearly trillion dollar institutional market 
these markets are very competitive and the company s success depends in part on the level of credited interest rates and the company s credit rating 
the focus of the ppli business is variable ppli products to fund non qualified benefits or other post employment benefit liabilities 
the leveraged coli business  while in run off  has been an important contributor to ppli s profitability in recent years and will continue to contribute to the profitability of the company albeit at lower levels 
the market served by ppli is subject to extensive legal and regulatory review that could have an adverse effect on its business

the company also continues to introduce new and enhanced products  which are expected to increase new sales 
the company continues to pursue broader and deeper distribution opportunities to increase sales

compared to net income increased for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to earned premium growth and net investment income growth as the result of the cna acquisition 
the increase in earned premiums was driven by sales excluding buyouts of for the current year  representing an increase of over sales reported in the prior year  and favorable persistency 
although benefits  claims and claim adjustment expenses increased  the segment s loss ratio was for the current year as compared to for the prior year  which contributed favorably to net income 
the loss ratio for the year was the result of improved mortality and morbidity experience as well as a change in mix of business discussed below that results in a lower loss ratio and higher expense ratio 
partially offsetting these favorable items for current year as compared to the prior year were higher commissions due to higher sales and premiums previously discussed 
additionally  operating costs increased due to the growth in the segment and the cna acquisition 
consistent with the increase in operating costs  the segment s ratio of insurance operating costs and other expenses to premiums and other considerations excluding buyouts increased to for the year ended december   respectively  from for prior year 
as part of the cna acquisition  a larger block of affinity business is now included in the group benefits segment 
this business typically has lower expected loss ratios and higher expected commission ratios than other products within the business 
compared to net income increased primarily due to increases in earned premiums and favorable claims experience 
premium growth was not as high as anticipated however due to lower sales to new customers in and lower persistency on renewals reflecting a competitive marketplace 
however  the segment reported an increase in total buyout premiums 
buyouts involve the acquisition of claim liabilities from another carrier for a purchase price calculated to cover the run off of those liabilities plus administration expenses and profit 
due to the nature of the buyout marketplace  the predictability of buyout premiums is uncertain 
although  total benefits  claims and expenses increased for the year ended december   total benefits  claims and expenses excluding buyouts decreased  or  over the same period 
the segment s loss ratio was  down from in partially offsetting these factors that contributed to the increased net income was an increase in insurance operating costs and other 
table of contents expenses due to the premium growth previously described and continued investments in technology  service and distribution 
the segment s ratio of insurance operating costs and other expenses to premiums and other considerations excluding buyouts was  increasing slightly from in outlook following the majority of the integration effort of the acquired group life and accident  and short term and long term disability businesses of cna financial corporation  the company anticipates the increased scale of the group life and disability operations and the expanded distribution network for its products and services will generate low double digit sales growth in sales  however  may be negatively affected by the competitive pricing environment in the marketplace 
management is committed to selling competitively priced products that meet the company s internal rate of return guidelines 
the two significant factors in evaluating this business are the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
based on historical experience trends and variability in the group benefits business  management expects the loss ratio in future periods to be in the range of to and the expense ratio to be in the range of to 
despite the current market conditions  including low interest rates  rising medical costs  the changing regulatory environment and cost containment pressure on employers  the group benefits segment continues to leverage off of its strength in claim practices risk management  service and distribution  enabling the company to capitalize on market opportunities 
additionally  employees continue to look to the workplace for a broader and ever expanding array of insurance products 
as employers design benefit strategies to attract and retain employees  while attempting to control their benefit costs  management believes that the need for the group benefits segment s products will continue to expand 
this  combined with the significant number of employees who currently do not have coverage or adequate levels of coverage  creates unique opportunities for our products and services 
property casualty executive overview property casualty is organized into four reportable operating segments the underwriting segments of business insurance  personal lines and specialty commercial collectively ongoing operations  and the other operations segment 
prior to the first quarter of  property casualty had also included the domestic assumed reinsurance business of hartre 
with the discontinuance of writing new assumed domestic reinsurance  hartre assumed reinsurance is now fully included in the other operations segment for all periods presented 
property casualty provides a number of coverages  as well as insurance related services  to businesses throughout the united states  including workers compensation  property  automobile  liability  umbrella  specialty casualty  marine  agriculture  bond  professional liability and directors and officers liability coverages 
property casualty also provides automobile  homeowners and home based business coverage to individuals throughout the united states as well as insurance related services to businesses 
property casualty derives its revenues principally from premiums earned for insurance coverages provided to insureds  investment income  and  to a lesser extent  from fees earned for services provided to third parties and net realized capital gains and losses 
premiums charged for insurance coverages are earned principally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the related policies in force 
service fees principally include revenues from third party claims administration services provided by specialty risk services and revenues from member contact center services provided through aarp s health care options program 
property casualty underwriting segments are evaluated by the hartford s management primarily based upon underwriting results 
underwriting results represent earned premiums less incurred claims  claim adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses 
underwriting results are influenced significantly by premium growth and the adequacy of the company s pricing 
property casualty seeks to price its insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin 
for many of its insurance products  property casualty is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments 
pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors  including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes  proper evaluation of underwriting risks  the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends  the company s response to rate actions taken by competitors  and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels 
underwriting profitability over time is also greatly influenced by the company s underwriting discipline which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification and by its ability to manage its expense ratio which it accomplishes through economies of scale and its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses 
in setting its pricing  property casualty assumes an expected level of losses from natural or man made catastrophes that will cover the company s exposure to catastrophes over the long term 
in most years  however  property casualty s actual losses from catastrophes will be significantly more or less than that assumed in its pricing due to the significant volatility of catastrophe losses 

table of contents iso defines a catastrophe loss as an event that causes or more in industry insured property losses and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers 
given the lag in the period from when claims are incurred to when they are reported and paid  final claim settlements may vary from current estimates of incurred losses and loss expenses  particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 
reserves for lines of business with a longer lag or tail in reporting are more difficult to estimate 
reserve estimates for longer tail lines are initially set based on loss and loss expense ratio assumptions estimated when the business was priced and are adjusted as the paid and reported claims develop  indicating that the ultimate loss and loss expense ratio will differ from the initial assumptions 
adjustments to previously established loss and loss expense reserves  if any  are reflected in underwriting results in the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary 
through its other operations segment  property casualty is responsible for managing operations of the hartford that have discontinued writing new or renewal business as well as managing the claims related to asbestos and environmental exposures 
as such  the underwriting loss in other operations is principally related to claim and claim adjustment expense development 
the company considers several measures and ratios to be the key performance indicators for the property and casualty underwriting businesses 
the following tables and the segment discussions for the years ended december   and include various premium measures and underwriting ratios 
management believes that these measures and ratios are useful in understanding the underlying trends in the hartford s property and casualty insurance underwriting business 
however  these key performance indicators should only be used in conjunction with  and not in lieu of  underwriting income for the individual property casualty segments and net income for the property casualty business as a whole and may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the company s competitors 
the company aims to achieve both growth and profitability in the business insurance and personal lines businesses and  therefore  key performance indicators for these two segments include both growth and profitability measures 
specialty commercial  however  is comprised of transactional businesses where premium writings may fluctuate based on perceived market opportunity 
as such  the key performance indicators do not include a growth objective for specialty commercial 
the number of policies in force is a growth measure used for personal lines only

in both automobile and homeowners  the policy in force count in has increased as a result of the new dimensions class plan rolled out in the latter part of and through the remainder of the increase is also attributable to continued growth in aarp business  reflecting growth in the size of the aarp target market and direct marketing programs to increase premium writings 
the policy in force count is a reflection of both the increase in new business and strong policy renewal retention of prior year business 
the company expects the number of policies in force to continue to increase for both automobile and homeowners in written pricing increase decrease written pricing increase decrease over the comparable period of the prior year includes the impact of rate filings  the impact of changes in the value of the rating bases and individual risk pricing decisions 
a number of factors impact written pricing increases decreases including expected loss costs as projected by the company s pricing actuaries  rate filings approved by state regulators  risk selection decisions made by the company s underwriters and marketplace 
table of contents competition 
written pricing changes reflect the property and casualty insurance market cycle 
prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business 
prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases 
in  written pricing in both business insurance and personal lines continued to increase  but at a slower rate than in in  the company expects written pricing for business insurance to turn slightly negative and expects written pricing for personal lines to be slightly positive 
as one of the factors used to determine pricing  the company s practice is to first make an overall assumption about claim frequency and severity for a given line of business and then  as part of the ratemaking process  adjust the assumption as appropriate for the particular state  product or coverage 
claim frequency represents the percentage change in the average number of reported claims per unit of exposure in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year 
claim severity represents the percentage change in the estimated average cost per claim in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year 
within personal lines auto  our overall assumption for the line of business is that frequency in the accident year will be generally flat and that severity will continue to increase 
this represents a change in frequency from the recent past  where claim frequency had declined 
within personal lines homeowners  we expect frequency to decrease slightly  compared to a more significant decrease in recent years  and severity to continue to increase 
within business insurance  expectations are generally for frequency to be flat  although we expect frequency to continue to decline  albeit moderately  in workers compensation 
as in personal lines  recent history in business insurance has shown more significant declines in frequency  so this assumption is an unfavorable change from recent years 
consistent with recent experience  severity within business insurance is expected to increase across all coverages 
for long tailed lines of business such as workers compensation and general liability  estimates of severity are subject to the same inherent uncertainty as estimates of loss reserves 
within the specialty commercial lines of business  the base assumptions for frequency and severity are similar to the assumptions for business insurance  but adjustments are made for the unique lines of business and for the individual risks or transactions being priced within specialty commercial 
premium renewal retention premium renewal retention represents the ratio of net written premium in the current period that is not derived from new business divided by total net written premium of the prior period 
accordingly  premium renewal retention includes the impact of written pricing increases decreases on renewed business 
in addition to written pricing changes  the renewal retention rate is impacted by a number of other factors  including the percentage of renewal policy quotes accepted and decisions by the company to non renew policies because of specific policy underwriting concerns or because of a decision to reduce premium writings in certain lines of business or states 
premium renewal retention has decreased from to due largely to the effect of written pricing increases on renewals 
new business premium as a percentage of written premium new business as a percentage of written premium has remained relatively flat over and for business insurance and has increased for both personal lines automobile and homeowners 
personal lines new business growth has been driven by rate increases filed in and and by the rollout of the company s new dimensions automobile and homeowner s class plan in the company expects the percentage of new business premium to total net written premium to remain relatively steady in as it continues its growth initiatives in both business insurance and personal lines

in  earned pricing increases have moderated as written pricing increases over the prior to months have declined 
during and  the company s property casualty operations have experienced earned pricing increases in excess of loss cost increases for business insurance and personal lines 
the company expects that at some point over the next twelve months  loss costs increases may begin to outpace earned pricing increases  although the company still expects to earn targeted returns in each of its businesses in loss and loss adjustment expense ratio the current year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is a measure of the cost of claims incurred in the current accident year divided by earned premiums 
the prior year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio represents the increase decrease in the estimated cost of settling claims incurred in prior accident years as recorded in the current calendar year divided by earned premiums 
among other factors  the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio needed for the company to achieve its targeted return on equity fluctuates from year to year based on changes in the expected investment yield over the claim settlement period  the timing of expected claim settlements and the targeted returns set by management based on the competitive environment 
while relatively flat from  the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is lower than anticipated at the time management set its pricing  principally because the change in the number of reported claims per unit of exposure or claim frequency for property losses has been lower than originally expected 
management does not expect claim frequency for property coverages to continue to be as favorable in the future 
in  management expects the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio to increase modestly as earned pricing increases moderate 
management expects claim frequency to remain relatively flat and expects claim severity to increase as a result of inflation in claim settlement costs  driven principally by medical cost inflation  property value increases and other indemnity cost increases 
expected increases in total loss costs  however  are expected to be partially offset by reductions in loss adjustment expenses per claim 
reserve estimates  including reserves for catastrophe claims  are inherently uncertain 
while the company believes its recorded reserves are established at a level to meet the ultimate cost of unpaid claims  reserve estimates may change in the future based on information or trends that are not currently known 
see reserves below for a discussion of prior accident year loss development and critical accounting estimates for a discussion of current trends contributing to reserve uncertainty and the impact of changes in key assumptions on reserve volatility 
expense ratio the expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses  excluding bad debt expense  to earned premiums 
underwriting expenses include the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and insurance operating costs and expenses 
deferred policy acquisition costs include commissions  taxes  licenses and fees and other underwriting expenses and are amortized over the policy term 
while changes in the expense ratio vary by segment  the overall expense ratio for ongoing segments 
table of contents has decreased during the period from to  principally due to the increase in earned premium and due to cost containment measures undertaken by management 
in business insurance and personal lines  the expense ratio is expected to decrease further in  largely as a result of expected increases in earned premium 
in specialty commercial  the expense ratio is expected to increase slightly in due to changes in the business mix  most notably the company s decision in the fourth quarter of to exit the multi peril crop insurance program which will eliminate significant expense reimbursements from the specialty commercial segment 
policyholder dividend ratio the policyholder dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premium 
combined ratio the combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio  the expense ratio and the policyholder dividend ratio 
this ratio is a relative measurement that describes the related cost of losses and expense for every of earned premiums 
a combined ratio below demonstrates underwriting profit  a combined ratio above demonstrates underwriting losses 
the combined ratio has decreased from to primarily because of improvement in the expense ratio 
the combined ratio in could be significantly higher or lower than the combined ratio depending on the level of catastrophe losses  but will also be impacted by changes in pricing and an expected moderation in favorable loss cost trends 
catastrophe ratio the catastrophe ratio a component of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio represents the ratio of catastrophe losses net of reinsurance to earned premiums 
a catastrophe is an event that causes or more in industry insured property losses and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers 
by their nature  catastrophe losses vary dramatically from year to year 
based on the mix and geographic dispersion of premium written and estimates derived from various catastrophe loss models  the company s expected catastrophe ratio over the long term is points

combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development the combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development represents the combined ratio for the current accident year  excluding the impact of catastrophes 
the company believes this ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year reserve development 
before considering catastrophes  the combined ratio related to current accident year business has improved from to principally due to earned pricing increases and favorable claim frequency 
other operations underwriting results the other operations segment is responsible for managing operations of the hartford that have discontinued writing new or renewal business as well as managing the claims related to asbestos and environmental exposures 
as such  neither earned premiums nor underwriting ratios are meaningful financial measures 
instead  management believes that underwriting result is a more meaningful measure 
the net underwriting loss for through is primarily due to prior accident year loss development  including billion of net asbestos reserve strengthening in reserve estimates within other operations  including estimates for asbestos and environmental claims  are inherently uncertain 
refer to the other operations segment md a for further discussion of other operation s underwriting results 
total property casualty investment earnings investment yield  after tax net realized capital gains losses  after tax the investment return  or yield  on property casualty s invested assets is an important element of the company s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before loss and loss adjustment expenses are paid 
for longer tail lines  such as workers compensation and general liability  claims are paid over several years and  therefore  the premiums received for these lines of business can generate significant investment income 
him determines the appropriate allocation of investments by asset class and measures the investment yield performance for each asset class against market indices or other benchmarks 
due to the emphasis on preservation of capital and the need to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy claim obligations  the vast majority of property and casualty s invested assets have been held in fixed maturities  including  among other asset classes  corporate bonds  municipal bonds  government debt  short term debt  mortgage 
table of contents backed securities and asset backed securities 
as of both december  and  approximately of property casualty s invested assets were held in fixed maturities 
the company s actual investment yields are influenced primarily by  among other factors  changes in market interest rates  prepayments on mortgage backed securities and the credit worthiness of individual issuers 
during  management expects after tax investment yields to decrease slightly as the before tax rate on newly invested funds is expected to be to in  compared to a before tax investment yield of in when fixed maturity or equity investments are sold  net realized capital gains losses are realized 
individual securities may be sold for a variety of reasons  including a decision to change the company s asset allocation in response to market conditions and the need to liquidate funds to meet large claim settlements accordingly  net realized capital gains losses for any particular period are not predictable and can vary significantly 
refer to the investment section for further discussion of net investment income and net realized capital gains losses 
risk management strategy the hartford s property and casualty operations have well developed processes to manage catastrophic risk exposures to natural catastrophes  such as hurricanes and earthquakes  and other perils  such as terrorism 
these processes involve establishing underwriting guidelines for both individual risks and in aggregate including individual policy limits and aggregate exposure limits by geographic zone and peril 
the company establishes exposure limits and actively monitors the risk exposures as a percent of property and casualty surplus 
generally the company limits its exposure to natural catastrophes from a single year event to less than of property and casualty statutory surplus for losses prior to reinsurance and to less than of property and casualty statutory surplus for losses net of reinsurance 
in specifically identified locations  the company manages aggregate terrorism exposures including exposures resulting from the company s group life operations 
the aggregate terrorism exposure in these locations  as measured by specific loss scenarios  is generally limited to an amount equivalent to approximately of the combined statutory surplus of the life and property and casualty operations 
the company monitors exposures monthly and employs both internally developed and externally purchased loss modeling tools 
the hartford utilizes reinsurance to manage risk and transfer exposures to well established and financially secure reinsurers 
reinsurance is used to manage aggregate exposures as well as specific risks based on accumulated property and casualty liabilities in certain geographic zones 
all treaty purchases related to the company s property and casualty operations are administered by a centralized function to support a consistent strategy and ensure that the reinsurance activities are fully integrated into the organization s risk management processes 
to minimize the potential credit risk resulting from the use of reinsurance  a centralized group evaluates the credit standing of potential reinsurers and establishes the company s schedule of approved reinsurers 
the assessment process reviews reinsurers against a set of financial and management criteria and distinguishes between long tail casualty and short tail property business 
a committee meets regularly to review activity with each reinsurer and affirm the schedule of approved reinsurers 
a variety of traditional reinsurance products are used in the development and execution of the risk management strategy 
the risk transfer products used include excess of loss occurrence based products that protect aggregate property and workers compensation exposures  and individual risk or quota share products  that protect specific classes or lines of business 
there are currently no significant finite risk contracts in place and the current statutory surplus benefit from all such prior year contracts is immaterial 
facultative reinsurance is also used to manage policy specific risk exposures based on established underwriting guidelines 
the hartford also participates in governmentally administered reinsurance facilities such as the florida hurricane catastrophe fund fhcf  the facility provided by the terrorism risk insurance act of and other reinsurance programs relating to particular risks or specific lines of business 
the hartford s principal catastrophe reinsurance program provides coverage  on average  for of the of catastrophic property losses incurred from a single event in excess of a retention 
the exact amount and percentage of coverage varies by layer 
in addition to the reinsurance protection provided by the hartford s principal catastrophe reinsurance program  in november  the company purchased two fully collateralized  four year reinsurance coverages for losses sustained from qualifying hurricane and earthquake loss events 
the company purchased this reinsurance from foundation re  a cayman islands reinsurance company  which financed the provision of reinsurance through the issuance of in catastrophe bonds to investors under two separate bond tranches 
the first coverage provides reinsurance protection above the company s principal reinsurance program and covers losses arising from large hurricane loss events affecting the gulf and eastern coast of the united states 
the coverage reinsures of in losses in excess of an index loss trigger of billion 
the index trigger has an estimated probability of attachment of approximately in years 
the second coverage purchased by the company reinsures of in losses in excess of in losses arising from qualifying hurricane and earthquake events 
qualifying hurricane and earthquake events are those which occur in the year following a large hurricane or earthquake event that has an estimated occurrence probability of in years 
the terrorism risk insurance act of established a program that will run through that provides a backstop for insurance related losses resulting from any act of terrorism certified by the secretary of the treasury  in concurrence with the secretary of state and attorney general 
under the program  the federal government would pay of covered losses after an insurer s losses exceed of the company s direct commercial earned premiums in  up to a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal 
table of contents government and all insurers of billion 
if an act of terrorism or acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the billion annual limit  insurers with losses exceeding their deductibles will not be responsible for additional losses 
presently  no material catastrophe reinsurance capacity exists for certified acts of terrorism  including those related to nuclear  biological  chemical or radiological attack 
the company actively manages its exposures to the peril of terrorism and has reduced exposures in specific locations through underwriting actions 
the company has worked with various industry groups to develop policy exclusions related to the peril of terrorism  including those associated with nuclear  biological  chemical and radiological attacks 
the company may include such exclusions in policies in the future in those jurisdictions and classes of business where such exclusions are permitted  and take additional underwriting actions as deemed appropriate

the combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development for ongoing operations improved by points  from in to in strong earned pricing and favorable claim frequency contributed to the improvement across business insurance  personal lines and specialty commercial 
compared to revenues for property casualty increased billion for the year ended december  the improvement was due primarily to earned premium growth in the business insurance  specialty commercial and personal lines segments  primarily as a result of earned pricing increases  as well as an increase in net realized capital gains of  and an increase in net investment income of partially offsetting the increase was a earned premium decline in the other operations segment primarily as a result of the company s decision to withdraw from the assumed reinsurance business as discussed more fully below 
on may   as part of the company s decision to withdraw from the assumed reinsurance business  the company entered into a quota share and purchase agreement with endurance reinsurance corporation of america endurance whereby hartre assumed reinsurance retroceded the majority of its domestic inforce book of business as of april  and sold renewal rights to endurance 
under the quota share agreement  endurance reinsured most of the segment s assumed reinsurance contracts that were written on or after january  and that had unearned premium as of april  in consideration for endurance reinsuring the unearned premium as of april   the company paid endurance an amount equal to unearned premiums less the related unamortized commissions deferred acquisition costs 
under the quota share agreement  endurance pays an override commission based on a percentage of all ceded premium and a profit sharing commission based on the performance of property treaty  property catastrophe and aviation pool unearned premium 
both the override commission and the profit sharing commission are recognized as income over the period the ceded contracts are in force 
under the purchase agreement  endurance will pay a renewal rights fee  subject to a guaranteed minimum of  based on the level of renewal premium on the reinsured contracts over the two year period following the agreement 
given that the company did not have a continuing obligation with respect to the renewal rights  the guaranteed minimum was recorded in income during the second quarter of  when the purchase agreement was entered 
during the first quarter of  the company fully transferred hartre assumed reinsurance to its other operations segment  where it remains subject to ongoing reserve development relating to all retained business 
net income decreased billion for the year ended december  primarily due to the net asbestos reserve strengthening of billion  after tax  in the first quarter of results for the year were favorably impacted by an increase in net realized capital gains losses and improved underwriting results in the personal lines and business insurance segments 
strong earned pricing and favorable claim frequency resulted in an increase in underwriting results in both the personal lines and business insurance segments

reserves reserving for property and casualty losses is an estimation process 
as additional experience and other relevant claim data become available  reserve levels are adjusted accordingly 
such adjustments of reserves related to claims incurred in prior years are a natural occurrence in the loss reserving process and are referred to as reserve development 
reserve development that increases previous estimates of ultimate loss cost is called reserve strengthening 
reserve development that decreases previous estimates of ultimate loss cost is called reserve releases 
reserve development can influence the comparability of year over year underwriting results and is set forth in the paragraphs and tables that follow

ongoing operations at the end of  several areas of reserve exposure were being closely monitored 
consistent with the company s practices to regularly review its reserves  the company continued to monitor these reserve exposures and completed several reserve studies  including studies related to september reserves and construction defects claims 
as a result of these monitoring activities and studies  during the first quarter of  the company made reserve adjustments with regard to certain of those reserve exposures  most notably related to september and construction defects 
during  the company made other reserve adjustments based on regular reserve evaluations performed each quarter 
these reserve adjustments  and the effects on the company s segments  are more fully discussed in the paragraphs that follow 
with respect to september claim reserves  the company observed favorable developments  including the closure of all but primary insurance property cases  a high participation rate within the victim s compensation fund and the expiration of the deadline for filing a liability claim in march based on these favorable events  the company determined that it was appropriate to reduce both the gross and net estimate of loss from september the company s ongoing operations and other operations gross estimate of loss of billion was reduced to the corresponding reduction in net reserves for september related to ongoing operations was in business insurance  in specialty commercial and in personal lines 
as of december   loss and loss expense reserves remaining related to september  both gross and net of reinsurance  are as follows september september segment gross reserves as of december  net reserves as of december  personal lines business insurance specialty commercial total ongoing operations substantially all of the net reserve balance is incurred but not reported ibnr and the majority of the balance is related to workers compensation exposures 
the company has exposure to losses from construction defects  particularly from contractors in california 
the company s exposure to losses from construction defects relates primarily to years prior to the company has been evaluating and closely monitoring these reserves 
based on the company s reserve study that used various predictive models and reflected the increasing severity of construction defect claims  the company concluded an increase in reserves of was required 
this increase consisted of for business insurance and for specialty commercial and is included in the general liability line of business 
as of december   reserves for specialty commercial general liability  net of reinsurance  were  the strengthening related to specialty commercial represents of the net reserves 

table of contents in addition to the release in september reserves and strengthening for construction defect claims  business insurance reserves were strengthened by during most of this reserve strengthening relates to auto liability and package business  reflecting an increase in the actuarial estimates of ultimate incurred losses for these lines  attributable to accident years as of december   business insurance reserves for auto liability  net of reinsurance  were the of strengthening represents of the net reserves 
package business reserves  net of reinsurance  for business insurance as of december  were  so the of strengthening represents of the net reserves 
during normal quarterly reserve reviews  the company s actuaries noted that  for both auto liability and package business  actual reported losses were above previous expectations 
in particular  the analysis indicated that there was a higher frequency of large claims generally those greater than  than had been anticipated in prior estimates 
the company increased its estimate of ultimate incurred losses to recognize this 
in addition to the foregoing reserve adjustments  within the specialty commercial segment there were other offsetting positive and negative adjustments 
the principal offsetting adjustments related to a strengthening in specialty large deductible workers compensation reserves and a release in other liability reserves  each approximately other operations reserves and reserve activity in the other operations segment are categorized and reported as asbestos  environmental or all other activity 
total net reserve strengthening for other operations was in  including of strengthening for asbestos and environmental reserves 
the asbestos and environmental strengthening primarily includes a increase in environmental reserves and a reduction in the reinsurance recoverable asset associated with older  long term casualty liabilities  including asbestos liabilities 
these actions are further discussed in the other operations segment md a discussion 
the largest component of the remaining of net all other strengthening for other operations was related to assumed casualty reinsurance 
the all other category of reserves covers a wide range of insurance and assumed reinsurance coverages  including  but not limited to  potential liability for breast implants  construction defects  lead paint  molestation  silica  pharmaceutical products and other long tail liabilities 
as of december   total reserves for hartre assumed reinsurance and all other liabilities within other operations  net of ceded reinsurance  were billion  so the strengthening represents a of these reserves 
the company has been evaluating and closely monitoring assumed reinsurance reserves in other operations 
during and  the company booked unfavorable reserve development of and  respectively 
unfavorable trends continued during and  as a result  the company increased reserves by the majority of the increase was for assumed casualty treaty reinsurance for the years through assumed reinsurance exposures are inherently less predictable than direct insurance exposures because the company may not receive notice of a reinsurance claim until the underlying direct insurance claim is mature 
this causes a delay in the receipt of information from the ceding companies 
in recent years  the company has seen an increase in reported claims above previous expectations and this increase in reported claims contributed to the reserve re estimates 
as noted in the ongoing operations discussion  the company continued to observe favorable developments with respect to reserves related to september particularly for other operations  these favorable trends included a lack of significant additional loss notices on assumed reinsurance property treaties 
the reduction in net reserves for september for other operations was as of december   gross reserves and net reserves remaining in other operations related to september were and  respectively

ongoing operations reserve strengthening in the business insurance segment for the year ended december  was not significant 
in personal lines  prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses for non standard auto were strengthened due to heavier than expected frequency  severity and litigation rates on prior accident years 
in addition  the prior accident year provision was increased modestly for mold losses 
virtually all of the strengthening in specialty commercial is due to deductible workers compensation losses on a few large accounts

impact of re estimates as explained in connection with the company s discussion of critical accounting estimates  the establishment of property and casualty reserves is an estimation process  using a variety of methods  assumptions and data elements 
ultimate losses may vary significantly from the current estimates 
many factors can contribute to these variations and the need to change the previous estimate of required reserve levels 
subsequent changes can generally be thought of as being the result of the emergence of additional facts that were not known or anticipated at the time of the prior reserve estimate and or changes in interpretations of information and trends 
the table below shows the range of annual reserve re estimates experienced by the hartford over the past four years 
the amount of prior accident year development as shown in the reserve rollforward for a given calendar year is expressed as a percent of the beginning calendar year reserves  net of reinsurance 
the percentage relationships presented are significantly influenced by the facts and circumstances of each particular year and by the fact that only the last four years are included in the range 
accordingly  these percentages are not intended to be a prediction of the range of possible future variability

table of contents the potential variability of the company s property and casualty reserves would normally be expected to vary by segment and the types of loss exposures insured by those segments 
illustrative factors influencing the potential reserve variability for each of the segments are discussed under critical accounting estimates 
in general  the company would expect the variability of its personal lines reserve estimates to be relatively less than the variability of the reserve estimates for its other property and casualty segments 
the company would expect the degree of variability of the remaining segments reserve estimates  from lower variability to higher variability  to be generally business insurance  specialty commercial  and other operations 
the actual relative variability could prove to be different than anticipated

the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was and as of december  and december   respectively 
the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is based on an assessment of the credit quality of the company s reinsurers as well as an estimate of the cost of resolution of reinsurer disputes 
the company completed an evaluation of the reinsurance recoverable asset associated with older  long term casualty liabilities  including asbestos liabilities  reported in the other operations segment 
as a result of this evaluation  the company reduced its net reinsurance recoverable by the after tax income effect of this action was the primarily related to a reduction of the amount of liabilities  principally asbestos  that the company expects to cede to reinsurers and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables 
premium measures written premium is a statutory accounting financial measure which represents the amount of premiums charged for policies issued  net of reinsurance  during a fiscal period 
earned premium is a gaap and statutory measure 
premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period 
the following segment discussions for the years ended december   and  respectively  include the presentation of written premiums in addition to earned premiums 
management believes that this performance measure is useful to investors as it reflects current trends in the company s sale of property and casualty insurance products  as compared to earned premium 
reinstatement premium represents additional ceded premium paid for the reinstatement of the amount of reinsurance coverage that was reduced as a result of a reinsurance loss payment

for the year ended december   earned pricing increases of for small commercial and for middle market contributed to the earned premium growth of in small commercial and in middle market 
the increase in earned premiums is partially due to an increase in select xpand product sales for small commercial and growth in workers compensation premium for middle market

underwriting results for the year ended december  improved  with a corresponding point decrease in the combined ratio 
the improvement in the combined ratio is mainly due to a decrease in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of points and a decrease in the expense ratio of points 
the improvement in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of points was due to a reduction in reserves for september and the impact of earning pricing increases in excess of loss cost increases  partially offset by of strengthening of prior accident year reserves  excluding september  and an increase in catastrophe losses  
table of contents excluding september  of points 
the prior accident year reserve strengthening excluding september of  or points  includes an increase in reserves of for small commercial package business  for auto liability claims and for construction defect claims 
catastrophe losses  excluding the reduction in september reserves  were in and included losses from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne in the third quarter of before catastrophes and all prior accident year development  underwriting results for the year ended december  improved  with a corresponding point decrease in the combined ratio  due to a lower loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and a lower expense ratio 
the decrease in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was primarily due to earned pricing increases and to improved claim frequency  partially offset by increased claim severity 
the expense ratio improved points  primarily due to earned premium growth coupled with a decrease in commissions as a percentage of earned premium 
commissions are a lower percentage of earned premium on workers compensation policies and workers compensation premiums were a higher percentage of earned premium in than in compared to earned premiums for the segment increased by for the year ended december   primarily due to earned pricing increases of and new business growth outpacing non renewals 
as substantially all premiums in the segment are earned over a month policy period  earned pricing increases in were primarily driven by written pricing increases of in the last six months of and during new business growth of in was primarily driven by growth in middle market business 
premium renewal retention for the year ended december  remained strong at compared to in underwriting results improved  with a corresponding point decrease in the combined ratio  for the year ended december   despite a significant increase in catastrophe losses due largely to hurricane isabel and severe tornadoes in the midwest 
before catastrophes  underwriting results improved  or  with a corresponding point decrease in the combined ratio 
the improvement was driven by a decrease in the loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophes for both small commercial and middle market  primarily due to improved claim frequency and double digit earned pricing increases 
in addition  double digit earned pricing increases and prudent expense management favorably impacted the expense ratio for the year ended december  outlook management expects the business insurance segment to continue to deliver strong results in although some price decreases within many markets of the commercial industry are expected  the company expects to achieve mid to high single digit written premium growth due  in part  to implementing continued strategic actions 
these actions include working with distribution channels to expand market share in targeted states  improving pricing opportunities through better segmentation of the market  offering flexible products that allow agents to tailor offerings to each customer  maintaining disciplined renewal underwriting and enhancing agency technology  including e submission capability 
loss costs are expected to increase due to less favorable trends in claim frequency and continuing trends of increasing claim severity 
as a result of the anticipated slight decrease in written pricing and increase in loss costs  management expects the loss and loss expense ratio to increase moderately in competition in middle market is challenging  but largely rational  with some classes of business experiencing more aggressive price competition 
written pricing in the small commercial market will also continue to be impacted by increasing competition as more national carriers enter the market 
nonetheless  we anticipate continued new business growth in the small commercial segment through execution of strategic initiatives and the continued growth of our select xpand product sales

table of contents outlook while the personal lines industry operating fundamentals are expected to be strong in  the market will continue to face significant challenges 
price increases in automobile and homeowners are expected to be in the low single digits 
regulatory requirements applying to premium rates vary from state to state  and  in most states  rates are subject to prior regulatory approval 
state regulatory constraints may prevent companies from obtaining the necessary rates to achieve an underwriting profit 
industry rates may remain inadequate in certain states in new business competition is still rational  but with lower rate increases  consumer shopping has slowed and fewer customers are switching carriers 
loss cost inflation is expected to rise in  and it is uncertain whether favorable claim frequency trends can continue 
automobile repair and medical cost inflation are expected to continue to outpace general inflation trends 
in  the personal lines segment is expected to deliver written premium growth in the high single digits by expanding the number of agents offering our dimensions products and increasing our direct marketing to the aarp membership base 
our new product and technology investments are expected to continue to deliver a competitive value proposition to independent agents

the company will retain responsibility for the mpci business written for the and prior crop years 
earned premium for mpci for the year ended december  was before considering the increase in mpci premiums  earned premiums for property declined by  reflecting a business decision to write less new business and renew less premium as a result of the decline in written pricing 
casualty written premiums were up for the year ended december   primarily because of written premium growth in alternative markets business and high single digit written pricing increases  partially offset by a decrease in premium renewal retention

this program was non renewed effective december   although it will continue to earn premium into the non renewal is not expected to have a significant impact on specialty commercial s underwriting results

the specialty commercial combined ratio improved points for the year ended december  as a result of strong earned pricing  higher ceding commissions in the professional liability line of business and prudent expense management  partially offset by the prior accident year reserve strengthening and increased catastrophe losses 
outlook specialty commercial is made up of a diverse group of businesses  each of which operates independently with its own set of business objectives and focuses on the operational dynamics of its specific industry 
these businesses  while somewhat interrelated  each have a unique business model and operating cycle 
given pricing declines in some markets  we anticipate negative written premium growth for although written price decreases for property and professional liability are expected to continue in  management expects written pricing increases in both casualty and bond 
we will continue to write and renew business where pricing and terms and conditions are reasonable 
management will continue to take actions to maintain profitability  including exercising underwriting discipline  maximizing growth in the segment s most profitable lines  providing innovative new products and expanding non traditional distribution alternatives 
in  both the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and the expense ratio will be impacted from exiting the mpci crop insurance business 
the mpci business made up of the earned premium in property for and had a higher loss ratio than the balance of the property business 
the mpci business also had one of the lowest expense ratios in specialty commercial because of the reimbursement of expenses from the federal government under the mpci program 
as a result of exiting the business  there will likely be an unfavorable impact to earned premium growth and the expense ratio  offset by a favorable impact on the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 
in addition  the non renewal of an alternative markets insured program  representing of earned premium in  will negatively impact casualty earned premium in  but is not expected to have a significant impact on underwriting results 
other operations including asbestos and environmental claims operating summary written premiums change in unearned premium reserve earned premiums benefits  claims and claim adjustment expenses amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs insurance operating costs and expenses underwriting results the other operations segment includes operations that are under a single management structure  heritage holdings  which is responsible for two related activities 
the first activity is the management of certain subsidiaries and operations of the hartford that have discontinued writing new business 
the second is the management of claims and the associated reserves related to asbestos and environmental exposures 
effective january   the financial results of hartre assumed reinsurance are fully reported in other operations  and and financial results have been restated to include hartre assumed reinsurance 
compared to earned premiums continue to decline as a result of the company s decision to exit from the hartre assumed domestic reinsurance business in the second quarter of underwriting losses decreased billion for the year ended december   primarily due to the impact of billion of asbestos reserve strengthening in the first quarter  and a reduction in september reserves of in the first quarter of these favorable variances were partially offset by the strengthening of assumed reinsurance reserves  the strengthening of environmental reserves in the third quarter of  and the provision associated with the evaluation of the reinsurance recoverable asset in the second quarter of compared to the decline in earned premiums was primarily due to the company s decision to exit the hartre assumed domestic reinsurance business 
the underwriting loss was driven by the first quarter net asbestos reserve strengthening of billion as discussed in the section that follows 
the paragraphs that follow are background information and a discussion of asbestos and environmental claims  the deteriorating trends with respect to asbestos  and a summary of the company s detailed study of asbestos reserves 
asbestos and environmental claims the hartford continues to receive claims that assert damages from asbestos related and environmental related exposures 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up costs 

table of contents the hartford wrote several different categories of insurance coverage to which asbestos and environmental claims may apply 
first  the hartford wrote primary policies providing the first layer of coverage in an insured s liability program 
second  the hartford wrote excess policies providing higher layers of coverage for losses that exhaust the limits of underlying coverage 
third  the hartford acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of risks previously assumed by other insurers writing primary  excess and reinsurance coverages 
fourth  the hartford participated in the london market  writing both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business 
with regard to both environmental and particularly asbestos claims  significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses 
traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of these claims  particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux 
the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures 
in particular  the hartford believes there is a high degree of uncertainty inherent in the estimation of asbestos loss reserves 
in the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures  factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include inadequate loss development patterns  plaintiffs expanding theories of liability  the risks inherent in major litigation  and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines 
furthermore  over time  insurers  including the hartford  have experienced significant changes in the rate at which asbestos claims are brought  the claims experience of particular insureds  and the value of claims  making predictions of future exposure from past experience uncertain 
for example  in the past few years  insurers in general  including the hartford  have experienced an increase in the number of asbestos related claims due to  among other things  plaintiffs increased focus on new and previously peripheral defendants  and an increase in the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities 
plaintiffs and insureds have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings  including pre packaged bankruptcies  to accelerate and increase loss payments by insurers 
in addition  some policyholders have asserted new classes of claims for so called non products coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not apply 
further uncertainties include insolvencies of other carriers and unanticipated developments pertaining to the hartford s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims 
management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
in the case of the reserves for environmental exposures  factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include expanding theories of liabilities and damages  the risks inherent in major litigation  inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims  and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured 
it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims 
it is unknown whether potential federal asbestos related legislation will be enacted  and if so  what its effect will be on the hartford s aggregate asbestos liabilities 
the reporting pattern for assumed reinsurance claims is much longer than for direct claims 
in many instances  it takes months or years to determine that the policyholder s own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in question may apply to such claims 
the delay in reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves 
given the factors and emerging trends described above  the hartford believes the actuarial tools and other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for its asbestos and environmental exposures 
for this reason  the hartford relies on exposure based analysis to estimate the ultimate costs of these claims and regularly evaluates new information in assessing its potential asbestos and environmental exposures 
the process of estimating asbestos and environmental reserves remains subject to a wide variety of uncertainties  which are detailed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves are reasonable and appropriate 
however  analyses of future developments could cause the hartford to change its estimates and ranges of its asbestos and environmental reserves  and the effect of these changes could be material to the company s consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
reserve activity reserves and reserve activity in the other operations segment are categorized and reported as asbestos  environmental or all other activity 
the following discussion relates to reserves and reserve activity  net of applicable reinsurance 
there are a wide variety of claims that drive the reserves within each category of other operations 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injury claims asserted by those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up costs 
the all other category of reserves covers a wide range of insurance and assumed reinsurance coverages  including  but not limited to  potential liability for breast implants  construction defects  lead paint  silica  pharmaceutical products  molestation and other long tail or late emerging liabilities 
the other operations book of business contains policies written from s to with the transfer of hartre assumed reinsurance into other operations in both and  other operations has exposure related to more recent assumed casualty reinsurance reserves  particularly for the underwriting years through the hartford s experience has been that this book of runoff business has over time produced significantly higher claims and losses than were contemplated at inception 
the areas of active claim activity have also shifted based on changes in plaintiff focus and the overall litigation environment 
a significant portion of the claim reserves of the other operations segment relates to exposure to the insurance businesses of other insurers or reinsurers whole account exposure 
many of these whole account exposures arise from reinsurance agreements previously written by the 
table of contents hartford 
the hartford s net exposure in these arrangements has increased for a variety of reasons  including the hartford s commutation of previous retrocessions of such business 
due to the reporting practices of cedants to their reinsurers  determination of the nature of the individual risks involved in these whole account exposures such as asbestos  environmental  or other exposures requires various assumptions and estimates  which are subject to uncertainty  as previously discussed 
during  as part of the company s ongoing monitoring of reserves  the company reclassified of reserves from the all other reserve category  of which was reclassified to asbestos and was reclassified to environmental claim reserves 
the increase in reserves categorized as environmental of occurred because the reviews  in each of the two categories of claims  employed actuarial techniques to analyze distinct and non overlapping blocks of reserves and associated exposures 
facts and circumstances associated with each block determined the resulting changes in category 
a portion of the reclassification relates to re estimates of the appropriate allocation among the asbestos  environmental and all other categories of the aggregate reserves net of reinsurance carried for certain assumed reinsurance  commuted cessions and commuted retrocessions of whole account business 
as part of the reclassification  the hartford also revised formulas that it will use to allocate among the asbestos  environmental and all other categories future claim payments for which reinsurance arrangements were commuted and to allocate claim payments made to effect commutations 
as a result of these revisions  payments categorized as asbestos and environmental exposures will be higher in future periods than in prior periods 
in december  halliburton announced its intention to file a pre packaged bankruptcy plan through one or more subsidiaries and in january  honeywell announced that it had reached an agreement with the plaintiffs bar that would enable it to file a pre negotiated plan through its former narco subsidiary  then already in bankruptcy 
in january  congoleum  a floor tile manufacturer  which previously had defended claims successfully in the tort system  announced its intention to file a pre packaged plan of reorganization to be funded almost entirely with insurance proceeds 
moreover  prominent members of the plaintiffs and policyholders bars announced publicly their intention to file many more such plans 
these events represented a worsening of conditions the company observed in in the first quarter of  several events occurred that in the company s view confirmed the existence of a substantial long term deterioration in the asbestos litigation environment 
for example  in february  combustion engineering  long a major asbestos defendant  filed a pre packaged bankruptcy plan under which it proposed to emerge from bankruptcy within five weeks  before opponents of the plan could have a meaningful opportunity to object  and included many novel features in its plan that its insurers found objectionable 
as a result of these worsening conditions  the company conducted a comprehensive  ground up study of its asbestos exposures in the first quarter of in an effort to project  beginning at the individual account level  the effect of these trends on the company s estimated total exposure to asbestos liability 
based on the company s evaluation of the deteriorating conditions described above  the company strengthened its gross and net asbestos reserves by billion and billion  respectively 
the reserve strengthening related primarily to policies effective in or prior years 
the company had incorporated an absolute asbestos exclusion in most of its general liability policies written after during the first quarter of  the company completed an updated gross asbestos reserve evaluation 
as part of this evaluation  the company reviewed all of its open direct domestic insurance accounts exposed to asbestos liability as well as assumed reinsurance accounts and certain closed accounts 
the company also examined its london market exposures for both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance 
the evaluation indicated no change in the overall required gross asbestos reserves 
during the second quarter of  the company completed an evaluation of the reinsurance recoverables associated with older  long term casualty liabilities reported in the other operations segment  including asbestos liabilities 
in conducting its other operations reinsurance recoverable review  the company used its most recent detailed studies of gross asbestos  environmental and all other liabilities reported in the segment  including its estimate of the type and potential timing of future claims  and analyzed the legal entities through which each exposed coverage was written  the reinsurance arrangements in place at each of these legal entities and the years of potential reinsurance available 
as part of its other operations reinsurance recoverable review  the company also analyzed recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants  recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers and the overall credit quality of the company s reinsurers 
as a result of this evaluation  the company reduced its estimated net reinsurance recoverable by  which was comprised of a reduction of ceded amounts and a increase in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance 
the after tax effect of this action was the company also consolidated within the all other category its allowance for insolvencies and disputes that might affect reinsurance coverage associated with other operations into a single allowance 
as of december   the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance totals in the third quarter of  the hartford completed an account by account review of its environmental exposures 
during the course of this review  the company found estimates for individual cases changed based upon the particular circumstances of each account  although the review found no apparent overarching cause or change in the claim environment 
the net effect of these changes resulted in a before tax increase in gross and net environmental liabilities 
in the fourth quarter of  the company completed a review of its non asbestos and environmental exposures in other operations 
as a result of this review  the company increased its assumed casualty reinsurance reserves by for the year ended december   assumed casualty reinsurance reserves were strengthened by a total of  including of strengthening in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter 

table of contents consistent with the company s long standing reserving practices  the hartford will continue to review and monitor these reserves regularly and  where future developments indicate  make appropriate adjustments to the reserves 
the loss reserving assumptions  drawn from both industry data and the company s experience  have been applied over time to all of this business and have resulted in reserve strengthening or reserve releases at various times over the past decade 
the company believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves are reasonable and appropriate 
however  analyses of future developments could cause the hartford to change its estimates and ranges of its asbestos and environmental reserves  and the effect of these changes could be material to the company s consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
currently  the company expects to perform an asbestos study in the second quarter of and an environmental study in the third quarter of in addition  the company currently expects to perform a comprehensive review of other operations reinsurance recoverables at least annually 
at any time there are significant developments that affect particular exposures  reinsurance arrangements or the financial condition of particular reinsurers  the company will respond by making adjustments in the portion of liabilities it expects to cede or in its allowance for uncollectible reinsurance 
the following table presents reserve activity  inclusive of estimates for both reported and incurred but not reported claims  net of reinsurance  for other operations  categorized by asbestos  environmental and all other claims  for the years ended december   and also included are the remaining asbestos and environmental exposures of ongoing operations

asbestos payments include payments pursuant to the macarthur settlement 

the one year and average three year net paid amounts for asbestos claims are  and  respectively  resulting in a one year net survival ratio of excluding the macarthur payments and a three year net survival ratio of excluding the macarthur payments 
net survival ratio is the quotient of the net carried reserves divided by the average annual payment amount and is an indication of the number of years that the net carried reserve would last ie survive if the future annual claim payments were consistent with the calculated historical average 

represents the transfer of reserves pursuant to the macarthur settlement 

the nature of these reallocations is described in the preceding discussion 
at december   asbestos reserves were billion  a decrease of billion compared to billion as of december  the decrease in asbestos reserves was due primarily to the macarthur settlement payment made in the first quarter of at december   asbestos reserves were billion  an increase of billion compared to billion as of december  net incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses were billion for the year ended december  the increase in reserves for as well as the increase in paid losses reflect asbestos claim and litigation trends 
the company classifies its asbestos and environmental reserves into three categories direct insurance  assumed reinsurance and london market 
direct insurance includes primary and excess coverage 
assumed reinsurance includes both treaty reinsurance covering broad categories of claims or blocks of business and facultative reinsurance covering specific risks or individual policies of primary or excess insurance companies 
london market business includes the business written by one or more of the hartford s subsidiaries in the united kingdom  which are no longer active in the insurance or reinsurance business 
such business includes both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance 

table of contents of these three categories  direct policies tend to have the greatest factual developments from which to estimate the company s exposures 
over the last three years  including the current reporting period  the company experienced a reduction in newly reported environmental claims on direct business  and actual claim payments have been made at levels within the company s previously established provisions for loss 
however  with respect to asbestos claims  the company experienced a variety of negative trends  including increasing numbers of policyholders making claims  an apparent increase in the number of claimants under such policies  and an accelerated rate of policyholder bankruptcies 
assumed reinsurance exposures are inherently less predictable than direct insurance exposures because the company may not receive notice of a reinsurance claim until the underlying direct insurance claim is mature 
this causes a delay in the receipt of information at the reinsurer level reflecting changes in the asbestos tort litigation and direct insurance coverage environments 
estimating liabilities for london market business is the most uncertain of the three categories of claims direct  assumed reinsurance and london market 
as a participant in the london market comprised of both lloyd s of london and london company markets  the company wrote business on a subscription basis  with the company s involvement being limited to a relatively small percentage of a total contract placement 
claims are reported  via a broker  to the lead underwriter and  once agreed to  are presented to the following markets for concurrence 
this reporting and claim agreement process makes estimating liabilities for this business the most uncertain of the three categories of claims 
on december   hartford accident and indemnity co 
hartford a i entered into a settlement agreement with macarthur co 
and its subsidiary  western macarthur co 
under the settlement agreement  during the first quarter of  hartford a i paid billion into an escrow account owned by hartford a i 
the funds were held in the escrow account until conditions precedent to the settlement occurred in april 
on april   the funds were disbursed from the escrow account into a trust established for the benefit of present and future asbestos claimants pursuant to the bankruptcy plan 
the settlement payments were accounted for as a reduction in unpaid claim and claim adjustment expenses during the first quarter of for the past three years  direct paid loss and expense for environmental claims have declined 
the vast majority of these payments have been made under settlement agreements that fully resolve the hartford s exposure to these insureds for environmental liabilities

outlook the other operations segment will continue to manage the discontinued operations of the hartford as well as claims and associated reserves related to asbestos and environmental exposure 
the hartford will continue to review various components of all of its reserves on a regular basis 

table of contents investments general the hartford s investment portfolios are primarily divided between life and property casualty 
the investment portfolios of life and property casualty are managed by hartford investment management company him  a wholly owned subsidiary of the hartford 
him manages the portfolios to maximize economic value  while attempting to generate the income necessary to support the company s various product obligations  within internally established objectives  guidelines and risk tolerances 
the portfolio objectives and guidelines are developed based upon the asset liability profile  including duration  convexity and other characteristics within specified risk tolerances 
the risk tolerances considered include  for example  asset and credit issuer allocation limits  maximum portfolio below investment grade big holdings and foreign currency exposure 
the company attempts to minimize adverse impacts to the portfolio and the results of operations due to changes in economic conditions through asset allocation limits  asset liability duration matching and through the use of derivatives 
for a further discussion of how the investment portfolio s credit and market risks are assessed and managed  see the investment credit risk and capital markets risk management sections of the md a 
him s security selection process is a multi dimensional approach that combines independent internal credit research along with a macro economic outlook of technical trends eg interest rates  slope of the yield curve and credit spreads and market pricing to identify valuation inefficiencies and relative value buying and selling opportunities 
security selection and monitoring is performed by asset class specialists working within dedicated portfolio management teams 
him portfolio managers may sell securities  except those securities in an unrealized loss position for which the company has indicated its intent and ability to hold until the price recovers  due to portfolio guidelines or market technicals or trends 
for example  the company may sell securities to capture market valuation inefficiencies or relative value opportunities through security or sector rotation  to remain compliant with internal asset liability duration matching guidelines often times a result of changes in interest rates  or to modify a portfolio s duration to capitalize on interest rate levels or yield curve slope 
him believes that advantageously buying and selling securities within a structured purchasing  monitoring and selling framework  provides the greatest economic value for the company over the long term 
pursuant to the adoption of sop  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  on january   the company reclassified billion of separate account assets to the general account 
of this amount  billion was associated with guaranteed separate accounts and was primarily comprised of fixed maturities 
these assets are classified as available for sale securities with changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income 
in addition  billion is primarily comprised of equity securities related to variable annuity products offered in japan 
these assets are classified as trading securities with changes in fair value reported in net investment income 
the remaining amount of related to policy loans on private placement life insurance products 
return on general account invested assets is an important element of the hartford s financial results 
significant fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could weaken the company s financial condition or its results of operations 
additionally  changes in market interest rates may impact the period of time over which certain investments  such as mortgage backed securities  are repaid and whether certain investments are called by the issuers 
such changes may  in turn  impact the yield on these investments and also may result in reinvestment of funds received from calls and prepayments at rates below the average portfolio yield 
net investment income and net realized capital gains and losses accounted for approximately  and of the company s consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in the percentage of consolidated revenues for  as compared to the prior years  is primarily due to income earned on separate account assets reclassified to the general account as a result of the adoption of sop fluctuations in interest rates affect the company s return on  and the fair value of  general account fixed maturity investments  which comprised approximately and of the fair value of its invested assets as of december  and  respectively 
other events beyond the company s control could also adversely impact the fair value of these investments 
specifically  a downgrade of an issuer s credit rating or default of payment by an issuer could reduce the company s investment return 
the company invests in private placement securities  mortgage loans and limited partnership arrangements in order to further diversify its investment portfolio 
these investment types comprised approximately and of the fair value of its invested assets as of december  and  respectively 
these security types are typically less liquid than direct investments in publicly traded fixed income or equity investments 
however  generally these securities have higher yields to compensate for the liquidity risk 
a decrease in the fair value of any investment that is deemed other than temporary would result in the company s recognition of a net realized capital loss in its financial results prior to the actual sale of the investment

compared to net investment income  excluding income on policy loans and trading securities  increased  or  compared to the prior year 
the increase in net investment income was primarily due to income earned on a higher average invested assets base  as compared to the prior year  and an increase in income from prepayment penalties primarily associated with commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs and yield adjustments related to changes in prepayment speeds associated with mortgage backed securities mbs held at a premium or discount 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the average new invested asset yield and the repositioning of the portfolio into higher quality assets as described below 
the increase in the average invested assets base  as compared to the prior year  was primarily the result of separate account assets reclassified to the general account pursuant to the adoption of sop and  to a lesser extent  assets acquired in the cna acquisition and operating cash flows

separate account products separate account products are those for which a separate investment and liability account is maintained on behalf of the policyholder 
prior to january   the company s separate accounts reflected two categories of risk assumption non guaranteed separate accounts wherein the policyholder assumes substantially all the risk and reward  and guaranteed separate accounts wherein the company contractually guarantees either a minimum return or the account value to the policyholder 
effective january   the guaranteed separate accounts are included with general account assets pursuant to sop as of december   the company s separate accounts totaled billion 
as of december   the company s total separate accounts totaled billion  of which billion was guaranteed separate accounts 
investment objectives for non guaranteed separate accounts  which consist of the participants account balances  vary by fund account type  as outlined in the applicable fund prospectus or separate account plan of operations 
separate account products include variable annuities  variable universal life insurance contracts and variable coli 
the assets and liabilities associated with variable annuity products sold in japan do not meet the criteria to be recognized as a separate account because the assets are not legally insulated from the company 
therefore  these assets are also included with general account assets effective january  products  previously recorded as guaranteed separate accounts but now recorded in the general account upon adoption of sop  primarily consist of modified guaranteed individual annuities and modified guaranteed life insurance and generally include market value adjustment features and surrender charges to mitigate the risk of disintermediation 
the primary investment objective of these assets is to maximize after tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters  including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets relative to that of policyholder obligations  as discussed in the capital markets risk management section of the md a under market risk life

in general  security issuers operating fundamentals have improved due to reduced company leverage  improved liquidity and the successful implementation of various cost cutting measures 
improvement in pricing levels for abs has been driven by a general stabilization in the performance of the underlying collateral and an increase in demand for these asset types due to improved economic and operating fundamentals of the underlying security issuers  better market liquidity and attractive yields 
the following discussion provides an analysis of significant other than temporary impairments recognized during  and  the related circumstances giving rise to the other than temporary impairments and the potential impact such circumstances may have on other material investments held 
during there were no significant other than temporary impairments eg or greater recorded on any single security or issuer 
in aggregate  other than temporary impairments recorded on abs primarily relate to the decline in market values of certain previously impaired securities 
other than temporary impairments recorded on equity securities primarily related to variable rate perpetual preferred securities issued by two highly rated financial services companies 
these securities are variable rate securities with unique structural interest rate reset characteristics that have sustained a decline in market value for an extended period of time primarily as a result of the increase in short term interest rates after the security s interest rate reset period 
as of december   the company did not hold other perpetual preferred securities in an unrealized loss position with similar interest rate reset characteristics 
during  other than temporary impairments were primarily recorded on abs  corporate fixed maturities and equity securities 
the abs other than temporary impairments were primarily due to the continued deterioration of the underlying collateral supporting the various transactions 
a significant portion of corporate fixed maturity other than temporary impairments during resulted from various issuers who experienced fraud or accounting irregularities 
in addition  during the first half of the year  corporate debt issuers in the transportation sector  specifically issuers in the airline sector  deteriorated as a result of the continued decline in airline travel 
during  there was one security for which a significant eg or greater other than temporary impairment was recorded  the circumstances of which are discussed in more detail below 

table of contents the of impairments on corporate fixed maturities within the food and beverage sector related to securities issued by the italian dairy concern  parmalat spa 
parmalat filed for bankruptcy in december due to liquidity problems when it was discovered that billion euros of liquid investments previously reported on its balance sheet were non existent 
the following list identifies abs and equity impairment losses recognized in that by issuer did not exceed but did when combined with securities supported with similar collateral or equity security types 
the circumstances giving rise to those losses are as follows the of cdo other than temporary impairments consisted of approximately ten securities  the majority of which were interests in the lower tranches of securities backed by high yield corporate debt 
these impairments were primarily the result of continued high default rates in and lower recovery rates on the cdo s underlying collateral 
the of other than temporary impairments recognized on abs supported by aircraft lease receivables primarily consisted of investments in lower tranches of five transactions 
these securities are supported by aircraft leases and enhanced equipment trust certificates together  aircraft lease receivables issued by multiple airlines that had sustained a steep decline in market value and adverse change in expected cash flows due to continued lower aircraft lease rates  airline bankruptcies and the prolonged decline in airline travel 
the of the other than temporary impairments recorded on equity securities primarily related to various diversified mutual funds 
the market values of these funds had fallen since the date of purchase due to declines in primarily the equity markets and were not expected to recover within a reasonable period of time 
due to the severity of the price depression and length of time the holdings were in an unrealized loss position  these securities were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
in addition to the impairments described above  fixed maturity and equity securities were sold at losses during  with no single security sold at a loss in excess of during  other than temporary impairments on abs were primarily driven by collateral deterioration associated with securities backed by aircraft lease receivables and high yield debt 
impairments recognized on corporate fixed maturities were concentrated in the technology and communications sector and were primarily driven by weakening economic conditions and operating fundamentals in the sector 
other than temporary impairments were also recorded on equity securities  the majority of which related to various diversified mutual funds 
the market values of these funds had fallen since the date of purchase due to declines in the bond and equity markets and were not expected to recover within a reasonable period of time 
due to severity of the price depression and length of time the holdings were in an unrealized loss position  these securities were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
during  there were securities for which a significant eg or greater other than temporary impairment was recorded which are discussed in more detail below 
of the technology and communications sector impairments  related to securities issued by worldcom and its subsidiary mci  which filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in july as a result of liquidity problems driven by economic and operating weakness in this sector  and specific issues related to accounting fraud 
of the of impairments relating to abs backed by aircraft lease receivables  related to investments in the lower tranches of one transaction that experienced a steep decline in fair value as a result of a significant decrease in aircraft lease payments and lower appraised values on the underlying collateral 
this transaction was primarily supported by lower quality aircraft and was significantly impacted by the decline in airline travel and numerous airline bankruptcies resulting from the catastrophic events of september  the remaining of impairments on aircraft lease receivables were primarily related to two other transactions that were also adversely impacted by similar circumstances surrounding the airline industry in in the technology and telecommunications sector  of impairments were recognized on fixed maturity securities issued by a major us telecom equipment manufacturer 
this issuer had amassed high levels of debt to acquire assets and subsequently experienced liquidity difficulties due to the downturn in demand and economic conditions within the technology and telecommunications sector 
as a result  this issuer initiated a debt restructuring in of the impairments recognized on abs securities backed by mh receivables  related to three securities issued by the same transaction 
these securities were backed by the transaction sponsor who ultimately filed for chapter bankruptcy protection as a result of numerous defaults on the underlying loans 
the manufactured housing sector experienced above average default rates in primarily due to weak underwriting practices and loan originators extending credit to sub prime borrowers 
another of impairments in the technology and communications sector related to a canada based local and long distance communications carrier 
as a result of excess capacity and margin erosion within the long distance sector  this issuer began to experience liquidity problems and eventually filed for bankruptcy in also within the technology and communications sector  of the impairments recognized related to a major us local and long distance service provider 
this issuer had amassed high levels of debt to increase capacity and was significantly impacted by reduced demand and margin erosion  particularly within the long distance sector 
as a result  this issuer initiated a debt restructuring in the following identifies abs impairment losses recognized in that by issuer did not exceed but did when combined with securities supported with similar collateral 
the circumstances giving rise to those losses are as follows 
table of contents the of cdo impairments consisted of approximately ten securities  the majority of which were interests in the lower tranches of transactions backed by high yield corporate debt 
these impairments were primarily driven by deterioration in the underlying collateral resulting from corporate bankruptcies and above average defaults on high yield bonds 
in addition to the impairments described above  fixed maturity and equity securities were sold at losses during  with no single security sold at a loss in excess of the favorable other than temporary impairments trend will depend on continued strong economic fundamentals  political stability and collateral performance 
in addition  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the future adoption of eitf issue no 
could result in the recognition of additional other than temporary impairments 
while the ultimate impact of the adoption of this standard is still unknown  depending on the nature of the ultimate guidance  adoption of this standard could potentially result in the recognition of unrealized losses  including those declines in value that are attributable to interest rate movements  as other than temporary impairments  except those deemed to be minor in nature 
as of december   the company had of total gross unrealized losses 
the amount of impairments to be recognized  if any  will depend on the final standard  market conditions and management s intent and ability to hold securities with unrealized losses at the time of the impairment evaluation

creditworthiness of specific obligors is determined by an internal credit evaluation supplemented by consideration of external determinants of creditworthiness  typically ratings assigned by nationally recognized ratings agencies 
obligor  asset sector and industry concentrations are subject to established company limits and monitored on a regular basis 
the company is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than of the company s stockholders equity other than certain us government and government agencies 
derivative instruments the company s derivative counterparty exposure policy establishes market based credit limits  favors long term financial stability and creditworthiness and typically requires credit enhancement credit risk reducing agreements 
credit risk is measured as the amount owed to the company based on current market conditions and potential payment obligations between the company and its counterparties 
credit exposures are generally quantified daily  netted by counterparty for each legal entity of the company  and collateral is pledged to and held by  or on behalf of  the company to the extent the current value of derivatives exceeds the exposure policy thresholds which do not exceed the company also minimizes the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties rated aa a or better  which are monitored by the company s internal compliance unit and reviewed frequently by senior management 
in addition  the compliance unit monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with company policies and statutory limitations 
the company also maintains a policy of requiring that all derivative contracts be governed by an international swaps and dealers association master agreement which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits right of offset 
to date  the company has not incurred any losses on derivative instruments due to counterparty nonperformance 
in addition to counterparty credit risk  the company periodically enters into swap agreements in which the company assumes credit exposure from a single entity  referenced index or asset pool 
total return swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments with other parties  at specified intervals  calculated using the agreed upon index and notional principal amounts 
generally  no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract 
typically  at the time a swap is entered into  the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value 
credit default swaps involve a transfer of credit risk from one party to another in exchange for periodic payments 
one party to the contract will make a payment based on an agreed upon rate and a notional amount 
the second party  who assumes credit exposure will only make a payment when there is a credit event  and such payment will be equal to the notional value of the swap contract less the value of the referenced security issuer debt obligation 
a credit event is generally defined as default on contractually obligated interest or principal payments or bankruptcy 
the average s p rating for these referenced security issuer debt obligations is a 
the company also uses credit defaults swaps to reduce its credit exposure by entering into agreements in which the company pays a derivative counterparty a periodic fee in exchange for compensation from the counterparty should a credit event occur on the part of the referenced security issuer 
the company entered into these agreements as an efficient means to reduce credit exposure to the specified issuers 
the average s p rating for all of these referenced securities issuers is a

effective january   guaranteed separate account assets were included with general account assets as a result of adopting sop 
table of contents the increase in consolidated available for sale securities with an unrealized loss greater than six months amounts was primarily driven by the aging of securities depressed due to interest rate changes from the date of purchase 
this increase was partially offset by improved pricing levels for certain cdos and abs  credit spread tightening  security sales and other than temporary impairments 
with the exception of abs security types  the majority of the securities in an unrealized loss position for six months or more as of december  were depressed primarily due to interest rate changes from the date of purchase 
the sectors with the most significant concentration of unrealized losses were abs supported by aircraft lease receivables and corporate fixed maturities primarily within the financial services sector 
the company s current view of risk factors relative to these fixed maturity types is as follows aircraft lease receivables the decrease in the unrealized loss position during was primarily the result of improving pricing levels for certain issuers in this sector  as well as by other than temporary impairments taken during the year 
in prior years  these securities had suffered a decrease in value as a result of a prolonged decline in airline travel  the uncertainty of a potential industry recovery and lack of market liquidity in this sector 
although uncertainty surrounding the stability of domestic airlines continues to weigh heavily on this sector  worldwide travel and aircraft demand appears to be improving 
while the company has seen modest price increases and greater liquidity in this sector during  any additional price recovery will depend on continued improvement in economic fundamentals  political stability and airline operating performance 
financial services as of december   the company held approximately different securities in the financial services sector that had been in an unrealized loss position for greater than six months 
substantially all of these securities are investment grade securities priced at or greater than of amortized cost as of december  these positions are a mixture of fixed and variable rate securities with extended maturity dates  which have been adversely impacted by changes in interest rates after the purchase date 
additional changes in fair value of these securities are primarily dependent on future changes in interest rates 
as part of the company s ongoing security monitoring process by a committee of investment and accounting professionals  the company has reviewed its investment portfolio and concluded that there were no additional other than temporary impairments as of december  and due to the issuers continued satisfaction of the securities obligations in accordance with their contractual terms and the expectation that they will continue to do so  management s intent and ability to hold these securities  as well as the evaluation of the fundamentals of the issuers financial condition and other objective evidence  the company believes that the prices of the securities in the sectors identified above were temporarily depressed 
the evaluation for other than temporary impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process  which is subject to risks and uncertainties in the determination of whether declines in the fair value of investments are other than temporary 
the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions  the issuer s financial condition or near term recovery prospects and the effects of changes in interest rates 
in addition  for securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows eg abs and cmbs  projections of expected future cash flows may change based upon new information regarding the performance of the underlying collateral 
as of december  and  management s expectation of the discounted future cash flows on these securities was in excess of the associated securities amortized cost

capital markets risk management the hartford has a disciplined approach to managing risks associated with its capital markets and asset liability management activities 
investment portfolio management is organized to focus investment management expertise on the specific classes of investments  while asset liability management is the responsibility of a dedicated risk management unit supporting life and property casualty operations 
derivative instruments are utilized in compliance with established company policy and regulatory requirements and are monitored internally and reviewed by senior management 
market risk the hartford is exposed to market risk  primarily relating to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates  market indices or foreign currency exchange rates 
the company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including parametric models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and the supporting investments  including derivative instruments under various market scenarios 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with the changes in market interest rates 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through asset allocation limits  asset liability duration matching and through the use of derivatives 
the company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including parametric models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and the supporting investments  including derivative instruments under various market scenarios 
measures the company uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk inherent in its invested assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities are duration and key rate duration 
duration is the weighted average term to maturity of a security s cash flows  and is used to approximate the percentage change in the price of a security for a basis point change in market interest rates 
for example  a duration of means the price of the security will change by approximately for a change in interest rates 
the key rate duration analysis considers the expected future cash flows of assets and liabilities assuming non parallel interest rate movements 
to calculate duration  projections of asset and liability cash flows are discounted to a present value using interest rate assumptions 
these cash flows are then revalued at alternative interest rate levels to determine the percentage change in fair value due to an incremental change in rates 
cash flows from corporate obligations are assumed to be consistent with the contractual payment streams on a yield to worst basis 
the primary assumptions used in calculating cash flow projections include expected asset payment streams taking into account prepayment speeds  issuer call options and contract holder behavior 
asset backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities are modeled based on estimates of the rate of future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the securities 
these estimates are developed using prepayment speeds provided in broker consensus data 

table of contents such estimates are derived from prepayment speeds previously experienced at the interest rate levels projected for the underlying collateral 
actual prepayment experience may vary from these estimates 
the company is also exposed to interest rate risk based upon the discount rate assumption associated with the company s pension and other postretirement benefit obligation 
the discount rate assumption is based upon an interest rate yield curve comprised of aaa aa bonds with maturities between zero and thirty years 
declines in long term interest rates have had a negative impact on the funded status of the plans 
for a further discussion of interest rate risk associated with the plans  see the capital resource and liquidity section of the md a under pension plans and other postretirement benefits and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that an increase in interest rates from the current levels is generally a favorable development for the company 
rate increases are expected to provide additional net investment income  increase sales of fixed rate life investment products  reduce the cost of the gmwb hedging program  limit the potential risk of margin erosion due to minimum guaranteed crediting rates in certain life products and  if sustained  could reduce the company s prospective pension expense 
conversely  a rise in interest rates will reduce the net unrealized gain position of the investment portfolio  increase interest expense on the company s variable rate debt obligations and  if long term interest rates rise dramatically within a six to twelve month time period  certain life businesses may be exposed to disintermediation risk 
disintermediation risk refers to the risk that policyholders will surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment requiring the company to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position 
in conjunction with the interest rate risk measurement and management techniques  significant portions of life s fixed income product offerings have market value adjustment provisions at contract surrender 
equity risk the company s primary exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of the life s businesses such as variable annuities where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management 
in addition  life offers certain guaranteed benefits  primarily associated with variable annuity products  which increases the company s potential benefit exposure as the equity markets decline 
for a further discussion  see life equity risk in this section of the md a 
the company does not have significant equity risk exposure from invested assets 
in march  the company decided to liquidate certain equity securities and reinvest the proceeds into fixed maturity investments  thereby reducing its exposure to equity price risk 
the company has not materially changed other aspects of its overall asset allocation position or market risk since december  the company is also subject to equity risk based upon the expected long term rate of return assumption associated with the company s pension and other postretirement benefit obligation 
the company determines the long term rate of return assumption for the plans portfolio based upon an analysis of historical returns 
declines in equity returns have had a negative impact on the funded status of the plans 
for a further discussion of equity risk associated with the plans  see the capital resource and liquidity section of the md a under pension plans and other postretirement benefits and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exchange risk the company s currency exchange risk is related to non us dollar denominated investments  which primarily consist of fixed maturity investments  the investment in the japanese life operation and a yen denominated individual fixed annuity product  and to a lesser extent  its gmdb and gmib benefit associated with its japanese variable annuities 
a significant portion of the company s foreign currency exposure is mitigated through the use of derivatives 
derivative instruments the hartford utilizes a variety of derivative instruments  including swaps  caps  floors  forwards  futures and options  in compliance with company policy and regulatory requirements to mitigate interest rate  equity market or currency exchange rate risk or volatility 
interest rate swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments with other parties  at specified intervals  calculated using the agreed upon rates and notional principal amounts 
generally  no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract 
typically  at the time a swap is entered into  the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value 
interest rate cap and floor contracts entitle the purchaser to receive from the issuer at specified dates  the amount  if any  by which a specified market rate exceeds the cap strike rate or falls below the floor strike rate  applied to a notional principal amount 
a premium payment is made by the purchaser of the contract at its inception and no principal payments are exchanged 
forward contracts are customized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments  at a future date  for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument 
financial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments  at a future date  for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument 
futures contracts trade on organized exchanges 
margin requirements for futures are met by pledging securities  and changes in the futures contract values are settled daily in cash 

table of contents option contracts grant the purchaser  for a premium payment  the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price  within a specified period or on a stated date 
foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies  agreeing to re exchange the currencies at a future date  at an agreed upon exchange rate 
there may also be a periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and exchanged principal amounts 
derivative activities are monitored by an internal compliance unit and reviewed frequently by senior management 
the notional amounts of derivative contracts represent the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk 
notional amounts pertaining to derivative instruments used in the management of market risk for both the general and guaranteed separate accounts at december  and were billion and billion  respectively 
the increase in the derivative notional amount during was primarily due to the embedded derivatives associated with the gmwb product feature 
the following discussions focus on the key market risk exposures within life and property casualty portfolios 
life life is responsible for maximizing after tax returns within acceptable risk parameters  including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets and the generation of sufficient liquidity to support policyholder and corporate obligations 
life s fixed maturity portfolios and certain investment contract and insurance product liabilities have material market exposure to interest rate risk 
in addition  life s operations are significantly influenced by changes in the equity markets 
life s profitability depends largely on the amount of assets under management  which is primarily driven by the level of sales  equity market appreciation and depreciation and the persistency of the in force block of business 
life s foreign currency exposure is primarily related to non us dollar denominated fixed income securities  the investment in the japanese life operation and certain foreign currency based individual fixed annuity contracts  and to a lesser extent  its gmdb and gmib benefits associated with its japanese variable annuities 
interest rate risk life s exposure to interest rate risk relates to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates 
changes in interest rates can potentially impact life s profitability 
in certain scenarios where interest rates are volatile  life could be exposed to disintermediation risk and a reduction in net interest rate spread or profit margins 
the investments and liabilities primarily associated with interest rate risk are included in the following discussion 
certain product liabilities  including those containing guaranteed minimum withdrawal or death benefits  expose the company to interest rate risk but also have significant equity risk 
these liabilities are discussed as part of the equity risk section below 
fixed maturity investments life s general account investment portfolios  including guaranteed separate accounts as of december   primarily consist of investment grade fixed maturity securities  including corporate bonds  asset backed securities  commercial mortgage backed securities  tax exempt municipal securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the fair value of these investments was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the fair value of these investments and life s other invested assets fluctuates depending on the interest rate environment and other general economic conditions 
during periods of declining interest rates  paydowns on mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations increase as the underlying mortgages are prepaid 
during such periods  the company generally will not be able to reinvest the proceeds of any such prepayments at comparable yields 
conversely  during periods of rising interest rates  the rate of prepayments generally declines  exposing the company to the possibility of asset liability cash flow and yield mismatch 
the weighted average duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was approximately and as of december  and  respectively 
in  the duration of certain life portfolios were modestly lengthened  which generated additional interest income 
liabilities life s investment contracts and certain insurance product liabilities  other than non guaranteed separate accounts  include asset accumulation vehicles such as fixed annuities  guaranteed investment contracts  other investment and universal life type contracts and other insurance products such as long term disability 
asset accumulation vehicles primarily require a fixed rate payment  often for a specified period of time 
product examples include fixed rate annuities with a market value adjustment feature and fixed rate guaranteed investment contracts 
the duration of these contracts generally range from less than one year to ten years 
in addition  certain products such as universal life contracts and the general account portion of life s variable annuity products  credit interest to policyholders subject to market conditions and minimum interest rate guarantees 
the duration of these products is short to intermediate term 
while interest rate risk associated with many of these products has been reduced through the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges  the primary risk associated with these products is that the spread between investment return and credited rate may not be sufficient to earn targeted returns 
the company also manages the risk of other insurance liabilities similarly to investment type products due to the relative predictability of the aggregate cash flow payment streams 
products in this category may contain significant actuarial including 
table of contents mortality and morbidity pricing and cash flow risks 
product examples include structured settlement contracts  on benefit annuities ie  the annuitant is currently receiving benefits thereon and short and long term disability contracts 
the cash out flows associated with these policy liabilities are not interest rate sensitive but do vary based on the timing and amount of benefit payments 
the primary risks associated with these products are that the benefits will exceed expected actuarial pricing and or that the actual timing of the cash flows will differ from those anticipated  resulting in an investment return lower than that assumed in pricing 
contract duration can range from less than one year to typically up to ten years 
derivatives life utilizes a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk 
interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts to a fixed or variable rate 
in addition  interest rate swaps are used to convert the contract rate on certain liability products offered by the company into a rate that trades in a more liquid and efficient market 
the use of such swaps enables the company to customize contract terms and conditions to customer objectives and satisfies the operation s asset liability duration matching policy 
occasionally  swaps are also used to hedge the variability in the cash flow of a forecasted purchase or sale due to changes in interest rates 
interest rate caps and floors  swaptions and option contracts are primarily used to hedge against the risk of liability contract holder disintermediation in a rising interest rate environment  and to offset the changes in fair value of corresponding derivatives embedded in certain of the company s fixed maturity investments 
at december  and  notional amounts pertaining to derivatives utilized to manage interest rate risk totaled billion and billion  respectively billion and billion  respectively related to insurance investments and billion and billion  respectively related to life insurance liabilities 
the fair value of these derivatives as reflected on the consolidated balance sheets was and as of december  and  respectively 
calculated interest rate sensitivity the after tax change in the net economic value of investment contracts eg guaranteed investment contracts and certain other insurance product liabilities eg short and long term disability contracts  for which the payment rates are fixed at contract issuance and the investment experience is substantially absorbed by life  are included in the following table along with the corresponding general and guaranteed separate account assets 
also included in this analysis are the interest rate sensitive derivatives used by life to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk 
certain financial instruments  such as limited partnerships  have been omitted from the analysis because the investments lack sensitivity to interest rate changes 
non guaranteed separate account assets and liabilities and equity securities held for trading and the corresponding liabilities associated with the variable annuity products sold in japan are excluded from the analysis because gains and losses in separate accounts accrue to policyholders 
the estimated change in net economic value below assumes a basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the yield curve 
change in net economic value as of december  basis point shift amount the fixed liabilities included above represented approximately and of life s general account liabilities as of december  and life s general and guaranteed separate account liabilities as of december  the assets supporting the fixed liabilities are monitored and managed within rigorous duration guidelines using scenario simulation techniques  and are evaluated on an annual basis  in compliance with regulatory requirements 
the after tax change in fair value of the general account invested asset portfolios that support certain universal life type contracts and other insurance contracts that possess significant mortality risk are shown in the following table 
the cash flows associated with these liabilities are less predictable than fixed liabilities 
the company identifies the most appropriate investment strategy based upon the expected policyholder behavior and liability crediting needs 
the hypothetical calculation of the estimated change in fair value below assumes a basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the yield curve 
change in fair value as of december  basis point shift amount the selection of the basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only as a hypothetical illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events 
actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis 
the company s sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets and liabilities remain materially consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between short term and long term interest rates will remain constant over time 
as a result  these calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re allocations  significant product sales or non parallel changes in interest rates 

table of contents equity risk the company s operations are significantly influenced by changes in the equity markets 
the company s profitability depends largely on the amount of assets under management  which is primarily driven by the level of sales  equity market appreciation and depreciation and the persistency of the in force block of business 
prolonged and precipitous declines in the equity markets can have a significant impact on the company s operations  as sales of variable products may decline and surrender activity may increase  as customer sentiment towards the equity market turns negative 
lower assets under management will have a negative impact on the company s financial results  primarily due to lower fee income related to the retail products group and institutional solutions group and  to a lesser extent  the individual life segments  where a heavy concentration of equity linked products are administered and sold 
furthermore  the company may experience a reduction in profit margins if a significant portion of the assets held in the variable annuity separate accounts move to the general account and the company is unable to earn an acceptable investment spread  particularly in light of the low interest rate environment and the presence of contractually guaranteed minimum interest credited rates  which for the most part are at a rate 
in addition  prolonged declines in the equity market may also decrease the company s expectations of future gross profits  which are utilized to determine the amount of dac to be amortized in a given financial statement period 
a significant decrease in the company s estimated gross profits would require the company to accelerate the amount of dac amortization in a given period  potentially causing a material adverse deviation in that period s net income 
although an acceleration of dac amortization would have a negative impact on the company s earnings  it would not affect the company s cash flow or liquidity position 
the company sells variable annuity contracts that offer one or more benefit guarantees that generally increase with declines in equity markets 
as is described in more detail below  the company manages the equity market risks embedded in these guarantees through reinsurance  product design and hedging programs 
the company believes its ability to manage these equity market risks by these means gives it a competitive advantage  and  in particular  its ability to create innovative product designs that allow the company to meet identified customer needs while generating manageable amounts of equity market risk 
the company s relative sales and variable annuity market share have generally increased during periods when it has recently introduced new products to the market 
in contrast  the company s relative sales and market share have generally decreased when competitors introduce products that cause an issuer to assume larger amounts of equity and other market risk than the company is confident it can prudently manage 
the company believes its long term success in the variable annuity market will continue to be aided by successful innovation in both product design and in equity market risk management and that  in the absence of this innovation  its market share could decline 
the company sells variable annuity contracts that offer various guaranteed death and income benefits 
the company maintains a liability for the death and income benefit costs  net of reinsurance  of  as of december  declines in the equity market may increase the company s net exposure to death benefits under these contracts 
the majority of the contracts with the guaranteed death benefit feature are sold by the retail products group segment 
for certain guaranteed death benefits  the hartford pays the greater of the account value at death  the sum of all premium payments less prior withdrawals  or the maximum anniversary value of the contract  plus any premium payments since the contract anniversary  minus any withdrawals following the contract anniversary 
for certain guaranteed death benefits sold with variable annuity contracts beginning in june  the retail products group segment pays the greater of the account value at death  or the maximum anniversary value  not to exceed the account value plus the greater of a of premium payments  or b of the maximum anniversary value of the contract 
the company currently reinsures a significant portion of these death benefit guarantees associated with its in force block of business 
the company s total gross exposure ie before reinsurance to these guaranteed death benefits as of december  is billion 
due to the fact that of this amount is reinsured  the company s net exposure is billion 
this amount is often referred to as the retained net amount at risk 
however  the company will incur these guaranteed death benefit payments in the future only if the policyholder has an in the money guaranteed death benefit at their time of death 
in addition  the company offers certain variable annuity products with a gmwb rider 
declines in the equity market may increase the company s exposure to benefits under the gmwb contracts 
for all contracts in effect through july   the company entered into a reinsurance arrangement to offset its exposure to the gmwb for the remaining lives of those contracts 
as of july   the company exhausted all but a small portion of the reinsurance capacity for new business under the current arrangement and will be ceding only a very small number of new contracts subsequent to july  substantially all new contracts with the gmwb are not covered by reinsurance 
these unreinsured contracts are expected to generate volatility in net income as the underlying embedded derivative liabilities are recorded at fair value each reporting period  resulting in the recognition of net realized capital gains or losses in response to changes in certain critical factors including capital market conditions and policyholder behavior 
in order to minimize the volatility associated with the unreinsured gmwb liabilities  the company established an alternative risk management strategy 
during the third quarter of  the company began hedging its unreinsured gmwb exposure using interest rate futures  standard and poor s s p and nasdaq index put options and futures contracts 
during the first quarter of  the company entered into europe  australasia and far east eafe index swaps to hedge gmwb exposure to international equity markets 
the hedging program involves a detailed monitoring of policyholder behavior and capital markets conditions on a daily basis and rebalancing of the hedge position as needed 
while the company actively manages this hedge position  hedge ineffectiveness may result due to factors including  but not limited to  policyholder behavior  capital markets dislocation or discontinuity and divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging indices 

table of contents the net impact of the change in value of the embedded derivative net of the results of the hedging program was an gain before deferred policy acquisition costs and tax effects for the year ended december  as of december   the notional and fair value related to the embedded derivatives  the hedging strategy  and reinsurance was billion and  respectively 
in december  the company purchased one and two year s p put option contracts to economically hedge certain liabilities that could increase if the equity markets decline

because this strategy is intended to partially hedge certain equity market sensitive liabilities calculated under statutory accounting see capital resources and liquidity  changes in the value of the put options may not be closely aligned to changes in liabilities determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  causing volatility in gaap net income 
the company anticipates employing similar strategies in the future  which could further increase volatility in gaap net income

property casualty property casualty attempts to maximize economic value while generating appropriate after tax income and sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder and corporate obligations 
property casualty s investment portfolio has material exposure to interest rates 
the company continually monitors these exposures and makes portfolio adjustments to manage these risks within established limits 
interest rate risk the primary exposure to interest rate risk in property casualty relates to its fixed maturity investments  including corporate bonds  asset backed securities  municipal bonds  commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the fair value of these investments was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the fair value of these and property casualty s other invested assets fluctuates depending on the interest rate environment and other general economic conditions 
during periods of declining interest rates  embedded call features within securities are exercised with greater frequency and paydowns on mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations increase as the underlying mortgages are prepaid 
during such periods  the company generally will not be able to reinvest the proceeds of any such prepayments at comparable yields 
conversely during periods of rising interest rates  the rate of prepayments generally decline

in  the duration of the property casualty portfolios were modestly shortened in anticipation of higher future interest rates 
calculated interest rate sensitivity the following table provides an analysis showing the estimated after tax change in the fair value of property casualty s fixed income investments and related derivatives  assuming basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve as of december  and certain financial instruments  such as limited partnerships  have been omitted from the analysis due to the fact the investments are accounted for under the equity method and lack sensitivity to interest rate changes 
change in fair value as of december  basis point shift amount the selection of the basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only for hypothetical illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events 
actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis 
the company s sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets remains materially consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between short term and long term interest rates will remain constant over time 
as a result  these calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re allocations or non parallel changes in interest rates 
currency exchange risk currency exchange risk exists with respect to investments in non us dollar denominated fixed maturities  primarily euro  sterling and canadian dollar denominated securities

table of contents capital resources and liquidity capital resources and liquidity represent the overall financial strength of the hartford and its ability to generate strong cash flows from each of the business segments  borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs 
liquidity requirements the liquidity requirements of the hartford have been and will continue to be met by funds from operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper  common stock  debt securities and borrowings from its credit facilities 
current and expected patterns of claim frequency and severity may change from period to period but continue to be within historical norms and  therefore  the company s current liquidity position is considered to be sufficient to meet anticipated demands 
however  if an unanticipated demand was placed on the company it is likely that the company would either sell certain of its investments to fund claims which could result in larger than usual realized capital gains and losses or the company would enter the capital markets to raise further funds to provide the requisite liquidity 
for a discussion and tabular presentation of the company s current contractual obligations by period including those related to its life and property casualty insurance refer to the off balance sheet and aggregate contractual obligations section below 
the principal sources of operating funds are premiums and investment income  while investing cash flows originate from maturities and sales of invested assets 
the hartford endeavors to maintain a capital structure that provides financial and operational flexibility to its insurance subsidiaries  ratings that support its competitive position in the financial services marketplace see the ratings section below for further discussion  and strong shareholder returns 
as a result  the company may from time to time raise capital from the issuance of stock  debt or other capital securities 
the issuance of common stock  debt or other capital securities could result in the dilution of shareholder interests or reduced net income due to additional interest expense 
the company s japanese life insurance operations are conducted through hartford life insurance kk a wholly owned subsidiary of hartford life and accident hla  one of the company s principal statutorily regulated operating subsidiaries 
to date  the company has funded the capital needs of its japanese operations through investments in the common stock of hartford life insurance kk by hla  an investment that stood at at the end of this arrangement has generally allowed some portion of the company s investment in its japanese operations to be included as part of the aggregate statutory capital for the purposes of regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy measures of hla 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating capital structures that it believes in the long term could result in improved financial flexibility 
certain of these structures would no longer allow a portion of the capital invested in our japanese operations to be included in the aggregate capital of hla 
this could potentially reduce certain of the capital adequacy measures employed by regulators and rating agencies to assess the capital strength of the hartford s domestic life insurance companies 
at the current time  the company believes it has sufficient financial resources to maintain capital adequacy levels consistent with all of its rating objectives 
the company may also repurchase outstanding shares of its common stock and equity units from time to time  in an aggregate amount not to exceed billion

hfsg and hli are holding companies which rely upon operating cash flow in the form of dividends from their subsidiaries  which enable them to service debt  pay dividends  and pay certain business expenses 
dividends to hfsg from its subsidiaries are restricted 
the payment of dividends by connecticut domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of connecticut 
under these laws  the insurance subsidiaries may only make their dividend payments out of unassigned surplus 
these laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend  which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of i of the insurer s policyholder surplus as of december of the preceding year or ii net income or net gain from operations  if such company is a life insurance company for the twelve month period ending on the thirty first day of december last preceding  in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting policies 
in addition  if any dividend of a connecticut domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer s earned surplus  it requires the prior approval of the connecticut insurance commissioner 
the insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which the hartford s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated or deemed commercially domiciled generally contain similar although in certain instances somewhat more restrictive limitations on the payment of dividends 
for the year ended december   the company s insurance subsidiaries paid to hfsg and hli and are permitted to pay up to a maximum of approximately billion in dividends to hfsg and hli in without prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner 
the primary uses of funds are to pay claims  policy benefits  operating expenses and commissions and to purchase new investments 
in addition  the hartford has a policy of carrying a significant short term investment position and accordingly does not anticipate selling intermediate and long term fixed maturity investments to meet any liquidity needs

the following points are significant to understanding the cash flows estimated for obligations under property and casualty contracts reserves for property casualty unpaid claim and claim adjustment expenses include case reserves for reported claims and reserves for claims incurred but not reported ibnr 
while payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they relate to insurance policies issued by the company  the ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case reserves and ibnr is an estimate  subject to significant uncertainty 
the actual amount to be paid is not determined until the company reaches a settlement with the claimant 
final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates  particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future 
in estimating the timing of future payments by year  the company has assumed that its historical payment patterns will continue 
however  the actual timing of future payments will likely vary materially from these estimates due to  among other things  changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements 
in particular  there is significant uncertainty over the claim payment patterns of asbestos and environmental claims 
also  estimated payments in do not include payments that will be made on claims incurred in on policies that were in force as of december  in addition  the table does not include future cash flows related to the receipt of premiums that will be used  in part  to fund loss payments 
under generally accepted accounting principles  the company is only permitted to discount reserves for claim and claim adjustment expenses in cases where the payment pattern and ultimate loss costs are fixed and reliably determinable on an individual claim basis 
for the company  these include claim settlements with permanently disabled claimants and certain structured settlement contracts that fund loss runoffs for unrelated parties 
as of december   the total property and casualty reserves in the above table of  are gross of the reserve discount of 
estimated life  annuity and disability obligations include death and disability claims  policy surrenders  policyholder dividends and trail commissions offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in force contracts 
estimated contractual policyholder obligations are based on mortality  morbidity and lapse assumptions comparable with life s historical experience  modified for recent observed trends 
life has also assumed market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs 
in contrast to this table  the majority of life s obligations are recorded on the balance sheet at the current account value  as described in critical accounting estimates  and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth  interest crediting  or future deposits 
therefore  the estimated contractual policyholder obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in reserve for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses  other policyholder funds and benefits payable and separate account liabilities 
due to the significance of the assumptions used  the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results 
as separate account obligations are legally insulated from general account obligations  the separate account obligations will be fully funded by cash flows from separate account assets 
life expects to fully fund the general account obligations from cash flows from general account investments and future deposits and premiums

table of contents pension plans and other postretirement benefits the company maintains a us qualified defined benefit pension plan the plan that covers substantially all employees  as well as unfunded excess plans to provide benefits in excess of amounts permitted to be paid to participants of the plan under the provisions of the internal revenue code 
additionally  the company has entered into individual retirement agreements with certain current and retired directors providing for unfunded supplemental pension benefits 
the company maintains international plans which represent an immaterial percentage of total pension assets  liabilities and expense and  for reporting purposes  are combined with domestic plans 
in september  the company announced its approval to amend the plan to implement  effective january   the cash balance formula for purposes of calculating future pension benefits for services rendered on or after january  for employees hired before january  these amounts are in addition to amounts earned through december  under the traditional final average pay formula 
employees hired on or after january  are currently covered under the same cash balance formula 
the company made voluntary contributions of  and in  and  respectively  to its defined benefit pension plans 
pension expense reflected in the company s net income was  and in  and  respectively 
the company estimates its pension expense will be approximately  based on current assumptions provided below 
the assumptions that primarily impact the amount of the company s pension obligations and periodic pension expense are the weighted average discount rate and the plan asset portfolio s expected long term rate of return 
in determining the discount rate assumption  the company utilizes current market information provided by its plan actuaries  including a discounted cash flow analysis of the company s pension obligation and general movements in the current market environment 
in particular  the company uses an interest rate yield curve developed by its plan actuaries to make judgments pursuant to eitf topic no 
d  selection of discount rates used for measuring defined benefit pension obligations and obligations of postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
the yield curve is comprised of bonds rated aa or higher with maturities primarily between zero and thirty years 
based upon all available information  it was determined that was the appropriate discount rate as of december  to calculate the company s accrued benefit liability 
accordingly  as prescribed by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  the discount rate will also be used to determine the company s pension expense 
at december   the discount rate was 
the company determines the long term rate of return assumption for the plan s asset portfolio based on analysis of the portfolio s historical compound rates of return since the earliest date for which comparable portfolio data is available and over rolling year  year and year periods  balanced along with future long term return expectations 
the company selected these periods  as well as shorter durations  to assess the portfolio s volatility  duration and total returns as they relate to pension obligation characteristics  which are influenced by the company s workforce demographics 
while the historical return of the plan s portfolio has been since  management maintained its long term rate of return assumption at as of december  based on its long term outlook with respect to the markets 
the plan s asset portfolio is generally structured over time to include approximately equity securities substantially securities issued by united states based companies and fixed income securities substantially investment grade and above 
at december   the portfolio composition varied slightly from the targeted mix and was approximately equity securities and fixed income securities due in part to a rebound in the equity markets and declining interest rates 
as provided for under sfas no 
 the company uses a five year averaging method to determine the market related value of plan assets  which is used to determine the expected return component of pension expense 
under this methodology  asset gains losses that result from returns that differ from the company s long term rate of return assumption are recognized in the market related value of assets on a level basis over a five year period 
the actual asset returns for the plan of and for the years ended december  and  respectively  reflect improved equity market performance  as compared to expected returns of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these differentials will be fully reflected in the market related value of plan assets over the next five years using the methodology described above 
despite the favorable actual asset return  the level of unrecognized net losses continues to exceed the allowable amortization corridor as defined under sfas no 
based on the selected discount rate of and taking into account estimated future minimum funding  the differential between actual and expected performance in will decrease annual pension expense in future years by approximately in and by approximately in at december   the change in the discount rate from as of december  to as of december  increased the projected benefit obligation pbo by the effect of this increase in pbo will serve to increase annual pension expense by approximately  assuming no future changes in discount rates going forward 
in addition  the decrease in discount rate will also increase the service cost component of pension expense by approximately changes in the economic assumptions used to determine pension expense will impact the company s pension expense 
as mentioned earlier  the two economic assumptions that have the most impact on pension expense are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
to illustrate the impact of these assumptions on annual pension expense for and going forward  a basis point change in the discount rate will increase decrease pension expense by approximately  and a basis point change in the long term asset return assumption will increase decrease pension expense by approximately 
table of contents the company presently anticipates contributing approximately to its pension plans in  based upon certain economic and business assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  equity market performance  changes in interest rates and the company s other capital requirements 
the company s required minimum funding contributions are estimated to be approximately capitalization the capital structure of the hartford as of december  and consisted of debt and equity  summarized as follows as of december  short term debt includes current maturities of long term debt long term debt

includes junior subordinated debentures and and debt associated with equity units of  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the hartford s total capitalization increased billion as of december  as compared with december  this increase was due to a billion increase in equity partially offset by a decrease in debt 
the increase in total stockholders equity is primarily due to net income of billion  the issuance of common stock of and a increase in aoci 
the increase in aoci is primarily the result of life s adoption of sop  which resulted in a cumulative effect for unrealized gains on securities in the first quarter of related to the reclassification of investments from separate account assets to general account assets  partially offset by net unrealized losses on cash flow hedging instruments 
the decrease in total debt reflects repayments of commercial paper of and senior notes of and the redemption of of junior subordinated debentures  offset by the issuance of in senior notes

stockholders equity issuance of common stock on january   the hartford issued approximately million shares of common stock pursuant to an underwritten offering at a price to the public of per share and received net proceeds of subsequently  on january   the hartford issued approximately thousand shares of common stock pursuant to an underwritten offering at a price to the public of per share and received net proceeds of the company used the proceeds from these issuances to repay of commercial paper issued in connection with the cna acquisition 
in september  the company s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to billion of its securities 
the company s repurchase authorization permits purchases of common stock and equity units  which may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
the company also may enter into derivative transactions to facilitate future repurchases of common stock and equity units 
the timing of repurchases will be dependent upon several factors  including the market price of the company s securities  the company s capital position  consideration of the effect of any repurchases on the company s financial strength or credit ratings  and other corporate considerations 
the repurchase program may be modified  extended or terminated by the board of directors at any time 
the company has made no repurchases under this program 
dividends on february   the hartford s board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share payable on april  to shareholders of record as of march

the funded status of the company s pension and postretirement plans is dependent upon many factors  including returns on invested assets and the level of market interest rates 
declines in the value of securities traded in equity markets coupled with declines in long term interest rates have had a negative impact on the funded status of the plans 
as a result  the company recorded a minimum pension liability as of december   and  which resulted in an after tax reduction of stockholders equity of and respectively 
this minimum pension liability did not affect the company s results of operations

statutory surplus represents the capital of the insurance company reported in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by the applicable state insurance department 
the table below sets forth statutory surplus for the company s insurance companies 
life operations property casualty operations total risk based capital the national association of insurance commissioners naic has regulations establishing minimum capitalization requirements based on risk based capital rbc formulas for both life and property and casualty companies 
the requirements consist of formulas  which identify companies that are undercapitalized and require specific regulatory actions 
the rbc formula for life companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance  business  asset and interest rate risks
