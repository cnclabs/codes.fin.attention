introduction we manufacture  both domestically and internationally  a wide array of specialty papers and engineered products 
substantially all of our revenue is earned from the sale of our products to customers in numerous markets  including book publishing  food and beverage  decorative laminates for furniture and flooring  and other highly technical niche markets 
refer to item business for additional information 
overview during the past few years  our industry has been adversely impacted by an imbalance between supply and demand for certain of our products 
in this environment during  we experienced declining sales volumes and lower average selling prices primarily in the more commodity like products offered by our specialty papers business unit 
two significant developments occurred over the course of the latter part of and throughout that improved our financial performance in the year over year comparison we undertook two major restructuring initiatives the north america restructuring program in and neenah restructuring in each of which is discussed in more detail in the following sections  and demand for products improved and selling prices strengthened beginning in the second quarter of  reversing deteriorating trends experienced in glatfelter 
table of contents the restructuring initiatives are focused on improving the profitability of our product mix by targeting higher value niche markets  increasing workforce productivity  and reducing costs by enhancing supply chain management strategies 
together with continued strength in our europe based long fiber overlay papers business unit and improved market conditions in north america  these actions contributed to a widening gross margin and increased gross profit 
our operating results also reflect increasing raw material prices particularly pulp and energy related costs and affects of a weaker us dollar on translated international operations 
in addition  over the past two years we generated gains of approximately million from the sale of non strategic timberlands and the corporate aircraft 
we were also successful in collecting million in insurance recoveries related to environmental claims 
these proceeds were primarily used to reduce our debt levels 
highlights from include achieved of total sales from new products introduced in the last five years 
developed and executed the north american restructuring program introduced improved product and service offerings for the book publishing market and increased market share in the premium book market 
developed a pipeline of products to grow revenue from uncoated specialty papers 
implemented a workforce reduction program while maintaining full production capability at the company s spring grove facility 
this program will be completed by the end of the first quarter of reduced production costs by implementing improved and expanded supply chain management strategies in north america 
reduced certain sg a expenses 
achieved strong growth in targeted markets led by a increase in volume in the long fiber overlay papers business unit 
improved pricing in north america which more than offset raw material cost increases 
enhanced financial flexibility by reducing net debt by million through improved operating performance and monetization of timberland assets

while the long fiber overlay business unit remains unchanged  the combination of the former engineered products and the printing converting papers business units into specialty papers allows us to more effectively manage the demand planning process  optimize product mix  minimize process variability and meet the demands of our customers 
as a result of this transition  all segment data has been restated to give effect to the further refinement of our organizational structure discussed above

table of contents the following table sets forth profitability information by business unit and the composition of consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes year ended december in thousands specialty papers long fiber overlay other and unallocated total net sales energy sales  net total revenue cost of products sold gross profit loss sg a pension income restructuring recorded as component of cos restructuring charges unusual items gains on dispositions of plant  equipment and timberlands gain on insurance recoveries total operating income loss nonoperating income expense income from continuing operations before income taxes supplementary data net tons sold depreciation expense results of individual business units are presented based on our management accounting practices and management structure 
there is no comprehensive  authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  therefore  the financial results of individual business units are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company 
the management accounting process uses assumptions and allocations to measure performance of the business units 
methodologies are refined from time to time as management accounting practices are enhanced and businesses change 
costs incurred by support areas not directly aligned with the business unit are allocated primarily based on an estimated utilization of support area services 
management evaluates results of operations before non cash pension income  restructuring related charges  unusual items  effects of asset dispositions and insurance recoveries because it believes this is a more meaningful representation of the operating performance of its core papermaking businesses  the profitability of business units and the extent of cash flow generated from core operations 
this presentation is closely aligned with the management and operating structure of our company 
it is also on this basis that company s performance is evaluated internally and by our board of directors 
sales and costs of products sold year ended december in thousands change net sales energy sales net total revenues costs of products sold gross profit gross profit as a percent of net sales net sales in the specialty papers business unit declined million  or in the year to year comparison 
approximately million of this decline was due to lower volume primarily attributable to the shutdown in late of a paper machine at the neenah facility 
selling prices in this business unit declined during most of  stabilized in the first quarter of and subsequently strengthened throughout the remainder of the year 
comparing the full year to  average selling prices for the specialty papers business unit declined slightly 
long fiber overlay papers net sales increased million  or  in the comparison due to an increase in volumes shipped  particularly in the food and beverage and composite laminates sectors  and a million favorable effect of foreign currency translation adjustments
