item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following section provides a narrative discussion about manatron s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
the comments that follow should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company enters into contracts with customers to license or sell application software  third party software  hardware  related professional services  such as installation  training  data conversions and post contract support and maintenance pcs services  and various appraisal services 
the company recognizes revenue for contracts with multiple element software arrangements in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
the company allocates the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each of the deliverables  determined based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
when discounts are offered in a software arrangement  the company utilizes the residual method  as defined in sop  and allocates revenue to the undelivered elements based on vsoe 
the discount and remaining revenue are allocated to the delivered elements  which typically encompass the software  service and hardware components of the contract 
certain of the company s software arrangements involve off the shelf software and services that are not considered essential to the functionality of the software 
for these arrangements  software revenue is recognized when the installation has occurred  customer acceptance is reasonably assured  the sales price represents an enforceable claim and is probable of collection  and the remaining services such as training and installation are considered nominal 
fees allocable to services under these arrangements are recognized as revenue as the services are performed 
revenue related to sales of computer hardware and supplies is recognized when title passes  which is normally the shipping or installation date 
pcs includes telephone support  bug fixes  enhancements and rights to upgrades on a when and if available basis 
these support fees are typically billed in advance on a monthly  quarterly or annual basis and are recognized as revenue ratably over the related contract periods 
billings for future services  as reflected in the accompanying balance sheets  includes pcs and other services that have been billed to the customer in advance of performance 
it also includes customer deposits on new contracts and other progress billings for software and hardware that have not been completely installed 
for arrangements that include customization or modification of the software  or where software services are otherwise considered essential  or for real estate appraisal projects  or for software that is not generally available  revenue is recognized using contract accounting 
revenue from these arrangements is recognized using the percentage of completion method with progress to completion measured based primarily upon labor hours incurred or units completed 
revenue earned is based on the progress to completion percentage after giving effect to the most recent estimates of total cost 
changes to total estimated contract costs  if any  are recognized in the period they are determined 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
as of april  and  the reserves for contract losses  as well as billed retainages outstanding associated with revenue that has been recognized  were not material 
since the timing of billings does not always coincide with revenue recognition  the company reflects revenues earned in excess of billings and retainages  as well as billings in excess of revenues for contracts in process at the end of the reporting period  as reflected in the accompanying balance sheets 
reserves against accounts receivable and reserves against revenues earned in excess of billings and retainages are established based on the company s collection history and other known risks associated with the related contracts 
these reserves contain a general provision of  as well as a specific provision for accounts the company believes will be difficult to collect 
because of the nature of its customers  which are predominantly governmental entities  the company does not generally incur losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
alternatively  customers may become dissatisfied with the functionality of the software products and or the quality of the services provided and request a reduction to the aggregate contract price 
management reviews significant past due accounts receivables on a quarterly basis and the related adequacy of the company s reserves 
as of april  and  the company s reserves for uncollecti ble accounts receivable and revenues earned in excess of billings and retainages were  and  respectively 
the company s contracts do not typically contain a right of return or cancellation 
for those that do  management reviews the adequacy of the company s reserves for returns or cancellations on a quarterly basis 
as of april  and  these reserves for returns were not material 
notes receivable result from certain software contracts in which customers pay for the application software  hardware or related services over an extended period of time  generally three to five years 
interest on these notes ranges from to 
the company recognizes revenue for these contracts when the related elements are delivered  as the contract terms are fixed and determinable  and the company has a longstanding history of collecting on the notes under the original payment terms without providing concessions 
in addition  certain of the company s contracts with customers include lease terms which meet the criteria of sales type leases as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases 
however  the company s leasing activities are not a material part of its business activities and  accordingly  are not separately presented in the accompanying financial statements 
the company has approximately million of goodwill recorded as of april  related to prior acquisitions 
as more fully described in note of the notes to financial statements  a new accounting standard adopted in fiscal requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairment at least annually and as indicators of impairment occur 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows of each reporting unit to determine estimated fair values 
changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect these estimates 
the annual tests performed by the company indicated that no impairment of goodwill has occurred 
as more fully described in note of the notes to financials statements  the company capitalizes software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility on a specific software project 
this intangible asset is amortized over an estimated useful life of not greater than three years 
the unamortized balance of capitalized software is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable by calculating the net realizable value for each respective product 
the net realizable value is the estimated future gross revenues from a product reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product 
changes in forecasted operations  driven primarily by market trends and customer demand  can materially affect the estimates of net realizable value 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year the company s business is primarily focused on providing software and services to enable local governments in north america to completely  fairly and efficiently assess real and personal property as well as bill and collect the related taxes from its citizens 
the company s software manages the entire property life cycle  which includes deed recording  mapping gis  assessment  tax billing and collection  tax sales and e government 
the company s revenues are generated from software license fees  hardware sales  forms and supply sales  and various related professional services  such as software support  data conversions  installation  training  project management  hardware maintenance  forms processing and printing 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues are also generated from appraisal services  which include mass real estate appraisals  revaluations and other appraisal related consultative work 
for simplicity purposes  many of the numbers described below are rounded  however  the percentage variations are based upon the actual amounts  which can be found elsewhere in this annual report 
total net revenues of million for the three months ended april  were higher than the million of net revenues reported for the prior year fourth quarter 
total net revenues for the year ended april  also increased by to million versus million for the year ended april  the following paragraphs explain the components of the company s revenues and the reasons for the net increases in more detail 
application software license fees increased by  to million for the three months and by million to million for the year ended april   compared to the respective prior year periods 
related professional service revenues decreased by  to million for the three months ended april  versus the prior year fourth quarter and increased by  to million for the year ended april  versus the prior year 
the increases for the year are primarily due to the recognition of license and service revenue on several new projects  including gwinnett county  georgia  duval county  florida  the arizona department of revenue  davidson county  tennessee and the city of virginia beach  virginia 
software license fees and related professional service revenues can vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year  as they are primarily driven by the company s backlog  new sales and the timing of the related software installations and implementations 
in addition  many of the larger and more complex jurisdictions  which the company is now able to pursue due to its new product and business strategy  often take more than a year to fully implement and a number of these contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion method  which results in the license revenues being recognized over the implementation period 
as noted in previous filings  the company went live with the assessment administration  personal property  proval and records components of its new grm product in gwinnett county  georgia during the second quarter of fiscal as part of its phase one delivery of that project 
this was a significant milestone that also contributed to the increase in software license fees and professional service revenues during the second quarter 
the majority of the effort following this activity has been devoted to completing the tax billing  accounts receivable  tax accounting  cashiering  delinquents and levy management modules of the grm suite  with which gwinnett county will go live subsequent to the company s fiscal year end 
since this contract is being accounted for under the percentage of completion method  there was approximately  of additional revenue recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal from this project 
there is approximately  of additional revenue on this contract that will be recognized in fiscal as this contract is completed 
the company installed manatron tax and began the implementation of this software in the duval county tax collector s office during the third quarter of fiscal this resulted in the recognition of approximately  of license and service revenue during the third quarter 
as previously announced  this was a new contract with the city of jacksonville  florida that totaled million over five years 
an additional  of license and service revenue was recognized during the fourth quarter 
there is approximately  of additional revenue to be recognized on this contract during fiscal as this project is completed 
the company began the implementation and installed its cama software for the department of revenue in the state of arizona in fiscal resulting in approximately  of license and service revenue during the third quarter 
the company recognized an additional  of revenue during the fourth quarter associated with this implementation 
as previously announced  this is the company s first contract in arizona  totaling million over a seven year period and covers all but three counties in the state 
the continued execution of this project will positively impact fiscal as noted in previous filings  the city of virginia beach signed a contract in november for the company s new grm system totaling million over six years 
this is the first manatron tax account in virginia and is also a new account for manatron cama 
the company currently has other cities and counties in virginia using manatron cama  which will be natural sales opportunities for manatron tax 
this project began during the third quarter resulting in approximately  of revenue 
installation of the company s cama software took place during the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting in approximately  of license and professional service revenue 
the company s tax software is not scheduled for installation until fiscal as a result  the majority of the license fees and professional service revenue from this contract will be recognized in that year 
the company installed manatron tax and began the implementation of this software in the davidson county trustee s office during the fourth quarter of fiscal this resulted in the recognition of approximately million of license and service revenue during the quarter 
as previously announced  this was a new contract with the city of nashville  tennessee that totaled million over five years 
there is approximately  of additional revenue to be recognized on this contract during fiscal as this project is completed 
the company recently signed a contract with another county in idaho for manatron tax 
this is the fourth county in idaho to contract with the company for manatron tax during fiscal these four contracts total million over five years 
all four counties are current users of manatron cama along with an additional of the counties in that state 
idaho is a new state and target market for manatron tax 
as noted in previous filings  the company has obtained approval from the state of idaho for other counties to order off the same rfp that was used for the initial counties  which should shorten the sales cycle 
these implementations are in process and resulted in approximately  of revenue recognition for the fourth quarter 
these counties will go live with the same grm software the company is deploying in gwinnett county  georgia  kenai  alaska and the city of virginia beach during fiscal the company also made additional progress within its core ohio market during the fourth quarter and recognized approximately  of license and service revenue 
implementations of the company s tax and cama software began in champaign county and mahoning county during the second quarter of fiscal and implementations in belmont county and wood county began in the third quarter 
progress also continued on cuyahoga  delaware and hamilton counties 
appraisal services revenues increased by  to million for the three months and by  to million for the year ended april   versus the comparable prior year periods 
the prior year total included  of non recurring appraisal services revenues related to the settlement of the allegheny county lawsuit noted in previous filings 
excluding this non recurring event  the increase in revenues for the year would have been greater 
these revenues vary primarily because of the cyclical nature of this business in ohio and other markets 
the company has been executing its backlog of appraisal services contracts and is currently entering the soft part of the sales cycle 
this will negatively impact revenues in fiscal provided the company is unable to sign additional appraisal services work in other markets such as florida  indiana and pennsylvania 
consistent with prior years  the company will make the necessary changes to ensure that it s costs of appraisal services are in line with anticipated revenues 
the increases in software license and professional service revenues noted above were partially offset by the following items first  the company completed the divestiture of its judicial product line effective may  this followed the divestiture of the financial product line effective may  see note of the notes to financial statements for further details on these transactions 
these sales negatively impacted revenues for the three months and year ended april  by approximately  and million  respectively 
the fiscal fourth quarter included  of revenue associated with these product lines  while the fiscal fourth quarter only included  of revenue 
the year ended april  included million of revenue associated with these product lines  while the year ended april  only included  these divestitures did however result in substantial one time gains of million and million for the years ended april  and  respectively  as noted in the accompanying statements of income 
second  hardware and third party software sales increased by  for the three months ended april   but decreased by  for the year ended april  compared to the same periods in the prior year 
hardware and third party software sales totaled  and million for the three months and year ended april   respectively  and  and million for the three months and year ended april   respectively 
the increase in the fourth quarter over the prior year is primarily due to the timing of several contract renewals within the illinois market  which included new hardware and hardware upgrades 
while the company offers hardware and third party software to those clients seeking a total solution from one provider  this will continue to be less of a focus as it is more of a commodity item with low gross margins 
in addition  the company has been pursuing contracts with larger jurisdictions who typically ha ve dedicated staff and other channels to handle their hardware  networking and database requirements 
the decisions to sell the financial and judicial product lines so the company could focus more clearly on its core tax and appraisal business  as well as the decision to transition the company away from a value added reseller of hardware to a software and solutions provider are in line with the company s business strategy 
furthermore  if you exclude the revenues related to the divestitures disclosed above  as well as the hardware and third party software sales from both years  the company s pro forma net revenues for the three months and year ended april  actually increased by and  respectively  versus the respective prior fiscal year periods 
third  the company has been working as a subcontractor for unisys for over a year to develop and implement a new property tax solution for the city of baltimore 
this is a multi year project valued at approximately million 
the city identified a number of new requirements for the software just prior to the scheduled go live date in june  which impacted the project 
while the company has been using the percentage of completion method to recognize revenue on this project  the go live date was a major milestone that would have triggered the recognition of additional revenue 
as a result  no revenue was recognized on this project during the third or fourth quarters of fiscal and only approximately  was recognized during fiscal the company has been working through change orders with unisys and the city for these additional requirements and has received approval for approximately million of work 
this will result in additional revenue during the first and second quarters of fiscal despite the improvements in software license fees and related professional service revenues during the second half of fiscal  total net revenues for the year were still below the company s expectations 
while proposal activity is steadily increasing  sales for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal much of this decrease was due to the cyclicality of appraisal services in ohio as sales of software  hardware and related services was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal more importantly  of the million in software  hardware and related services that was signed during fiscal  million or of this amount has been to new clients 
historically  the majority of the company s sales have been to existing clients 
the decrease in sales will negatively impact net revenues in fiscal and beyond provided the company is unable to sign additional contracts in the near term 
now that the national election is complete and considering that the majority of local governments in north america are using legacy software and technology for their mission critical property tax systems  the company expects to see an upswing in purchasing over the next several quarters 
furthermore  a successful delivery of the gwinnett and other grm projects during fiscal should allow the company to build significant momentum in the market going forward 
the company s backlog for software and related services decreased slightly from million at april  to million as of april  the backlog for appraisal services decreased from million at april  to as of april  due to the cyclicality of this business 
as of april   recurring revenues stood at million on an annualized basis or approximately of total revenues 
cost of revenues increased by from million to million for the three months ended april  and by from million to million for the year ended april   compared to the respective prior year periods 
the company s salaries and benefits associated with those employees who left in connection with the judicial and financial product line divestitures noted previously were lower 
in addition  costs of hardware and third party software sales were also lower due to the decrease in the associated revenues noted previously 
however  these reductions were offset by additional costs of revenues related to project managers and other personnel who were hired during fiscal to work on many of the significant new contracts recently awarded and currently underway 
secondly  salaries and benefits for customer service personnel increased over fiscal  primarily due to annual raises and bonuses 
thirdly  the company had to utilize subcontractors to assist with the execution of the baltimore project  which contributed to significant cost overruns on that contract 
finally  software amortization expense has been increasing due to the company s investments in its new grm suite of software and was million for fiscal versus million for fiscal as a result of the increased cost of revenues  the company s gross profit margin decreased to for the three months ended april  compared to for the prior year three month period 
gross margins decreased to for the year ended april  versus for the year ended april  the prior year included  of revenue with no associated cost related to the allegheny settlement noted elsewhere in this report 
excluding this non recurring item  the company s gross profit margin for fiscal was 
fluctuations in gross margins occur with changes in the mix and amount of revenue  as a large amount of the company s cost of revenues are fixed 
as the company s revenues grow and the mix continues to positively shift toward more software business  the company will be able to further leverage its fixed costs and expects to report a blended gross profit margin closer to 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to million for the three months ended april  from million in the prior year fourth quarter 
these costs increased by approximately or million to million for the year ended april  versus the prior fiscal year 
the increase over the prior year is directly related to the company s additional investment in its sales  marketing and product development activities as noted in prior reports 
in addition  the company has been building an infrastructure capable of supporting to million in quarterly revenues that will also be scalable to higher levels 
there were several new roles created during fiscal and within these areas  which resulted in additional salaries and benefits for the year ended april  however  the company s spending was under budget given that its revenues for the fiscal year were below expectations 
sales and marketing expenditures also increased over the prior year because the company started investing in its new branding strategy  which is primarily focused on positioning the company as a single entity with national expertise in the grm market 
the first quarter included additional costs for attendance and participation in the naco national association of county officials and nactfo national association of county treasurers and finance officers conferences in phoenix 
the second quarter included additional costs for the iaao international association of assessment officers conference in boston 
the company unveiled this new strategy at these conferences 
included in this was the cost of new trade show booths  a new company logo and other materials  which the company will be able to leverage in future periods 
finally  the company has also been incurring costs to update its website and other marketing collaterals 
administrative expenses also increased because bad debt expense grew by  to  for the year ended april  compared to the prior fiscal year 
in the prior year  bad debt expense was actually a credit as it included approximately  of recoveries associated with the allegheny lawsuit settlement noted elsewhere in this report 
as a result of the factors noted above  the company reported income from operations of approximately million for the three months and million for the year ended april   compared to operating income of million and million for the respective prior year periods 
operating income for the prior year included a non recurring favorable settlement from the allegheny county lawsuit in the amount of as more fully described in note of the notes to financial statements  the company recorded non recurring gains of million and million for the years ended april  and  respectively  on the sale of its judicial and financial product lines 
net other income for the three months and year ended april  was  and  respectively 
these amounts are comparable to the  and  of net other income reported for the respective periods in the prior fiscal year 
these amounts primarily consist of interest earned on the company s cash balances  as well as rental income associated with leasing a portion of its corporate headquarters 
the company s provision for income taxes generally fluctuates with the level of pretax income 
the effective tax rate was and for the three months and year ended april   respectively  compared to and for the comparable prior year periods 
the increase in the provision for the year ended april  is due to the inclusion of state tax expense for that year within the income tax provision  which was not the case in the prior year 
in addition  the prior year provision also included a non recurring favorable adjustment related to the company s deferred state tax assets  which lowered the effective tax rate 
the company reported net income of  or per diluted share for the three months ended april   compared to net income of  or per diluted share for the three months ended april  net income was million or per diluted share for the year ended april   and includes an after tax non recurring gain of million using an effective tax rate of or per diluted share related to the sale of the company s judicial product line in may net income was million or per diluted share for the year ended april   and includes an after tax non recurring gain of million using an effective tax rate of or per diluted share related to the sale of the company s financial product line in may in addition  the year ended april  included  of operating income related to the settlement of the allegheny lawsuit noted elsewhere in this report 
this non recurring settlement positively impacted the prior year net income by  using an effective tax rate of or per diluted share 
diluted weighted average outstanding common shares increased by approximately  and  shares for the three months and year ended april   respectively  over the comparable prior year periods 
these increases were primarily due to the issuance of shares in connection with the company s stock plans and the exercise of stock options 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year total net revenues for the three months ended april  of million increased by compared to the million that was reported for the three months ended april  more importantly  fourth quarter revenues were more than higher than the quarterly revenues that were reported for each of the first three quarters of fiscal this improvement resulted from additional software license fees and related service revenues driven by increased implementation activity in florida 
for the three months ended april   software license fees and professional services revenues increased to million from million for the three months ended april  the company extended significant resources and attention in fiscal toward the development and implementation of its florida tax product  which was being used in six beta counties 
this product became available for general release in march as a result  approxi mately million of the million of backlog reported as of january  was recognized in the fourth quarter 
total net revenues of million for the year ended april  decreased by compared to million for the year ended april  the following factors affected revenues during fiscal first  the sale of the financial product line on may   as previously noted  resulted in a  and million reduction in net revenues for the three months and year ended april   respectively 
the company only reported approximately  of revenues related to this product line for the three months ended april  and  for fiscal compared to approximately  and million from this product line for the three months and year ended april  second  hardware sales for the three months and year ended april  were approximately  and  lower than the comparable amounts for the three months and year ended april  these decreases were primary due to a change in the company s strategic direction during the last five years 
the company historically sold more hardware as a value added reseller for large computer manufacturers  but is now focused on providing innovative software and services 
while the company still offers hardware to those clients seeking a total solution from one provider  hardware sales should continue to decrease as customers view it as a commodity item  with low gross margins 
third  software license fees and related service revenues for the year ended april  decreased to million from million for the year ended april  this decrease was primarily due to the slower than anticipated execution of the backlog in florida during the company s first three quarters of fiscal in addition  fiscal included a significant amount of license fees and professional services revenue from cuyahoga county cleveland  ohio related to its tax implementation that went live in december of the company expected to build off of this momentum during fiscal  however  sales in ohio  as well as other regions throughout the country were softer than anticipated 
hamilton county cincinnati  ohio did go live on the company s new tax and appraisal system in december of  which resulted in positive momentum for ohio 
for example  five additional counties signed contracts between september and april  for this software  which totaled approximately million  and several other counties were in the sales pipeline 
the company recognized approximately million of revenues during the second half of fiscal related to its new grm contract with gwinnett county  georgia  which offset a portion of the decrease noted above 
lengthy sales cycles in local government caused in part by increased competition and budget constraints felt nationwide resulted in a lower volume of new contract signings than anticipated during fiscal this negatively impacted the company s revenues 
in addition  national election years have historically been soft  as far as sales are concerned  since many governmental officials are preoccupied with the election process and delay spending until the results are known 
prior to fiscal  the majority of the company s investments had primarily been focused on new product development 
during fiscal  the company began to aggressively invest in sales and marketing efforts to build off of its successful implementations and extend its software and services into new markets 
marty ulanski was hired as the company s executive vice president of sales and business development in july this was a new position for the company and his role was to build a sales team to drive significant revenue 
in addition  early stephens  the company s chief technology officer was appointed chief marketing officer in support of this effort 
this also was a new position for the company 
while building a more effective sales and marketing team is a long term effort  these investments began to pay off 
for example  the company announced on november  the award of an additional million of new tax and appraisal business to three existing and two new clients 
in addition  total sales or signed contracts for fiscal were million versus million for fiscal  which was a improvement 
included in these amounts was a million increase or improvement in sales of software and related services 
this increase was offset by a million decrease in appraisal services contracts and a  decrease in hardware sales 
the million in new contracts resulted in an increase in the company s backlog to million at april  the backlog at april  was million 
these backlog amounts are exclusive of the company s recurring revenues which were approximately million annually 
while recurring revenue had declined in absolute terms year over year due to the sale of the company s financial product line  excluding the impact of this sale  recurring revenue actually increased by approximately million for fiscal compared to fiscal the improvements in recurring revenue were due to price increases and the addition of new clients 
of the million of total sales for fiscal noted above  were to new clients 
new recurring support revenues are billed once the related implementations are complete 
these new clients also resulted in an increase in market share for the company 
the final factor affecting revenues was appraisal service revenues  which decreased to million for the three months ended april  versus million for the three months ended april  and increased to million for the year ended april  compared to million for the year ended april  appraisal service revenues for the year ended april  included  of revenue associated with the settlement of the allegheny lawsuit noted below 
the remaining increase in appraisal service revenues was due to the execution of additional appraisal business  which was primarily due to the cyclicality of this business in ohio 
on january   the company settled its lawsuit with allegheny county for approximately  in cash and a mutual release of all claims related to this project 
the company had not recognized the uncollected retainage revenue related to the allegheny county project  which was  in addition  the company had fully reserved within its allowance for uncollectible accounts the remaining amounts that were owed by allegheny county 
accordingly  this settlement resulted in the recognition of  of revenue and a reduction of operating expenses of  during the company s third quarter of fiscal cost of revenues decreased by to million for the quarter ended april  versus million for the quarter ended april  for the year ended april  cost of revenues decreased by to million from million for fiscal both of these decreases were primarily related to a shift in the company s revenue mix 
gross margins increased by from to for the fourth quarter of fiscal and by from to for the year ended april  versus the three months and year ended april  the significant improvement in the fourth quarter was driven by the recognition of more application license fees associated primarily with the company s florida tax product 
in addition  the continued execution on some of the company s larger projects  such as baltimore  maryland  jefferson county  alabama and gwinnett county  georgia contributed to this increase 
the company recognized million i n application license fees for the quarter ended april  compared to million for the quarter ended april  application license fees were million for the year ended april  compared to million for fiscal since there is nominal variable cost associated with the company s application license fees  changes in this revenue stream have a significant impact on the company s gross margins 
total cost of revenues for fiscal also included the impact of the allegheny lawsuit noted previously  which resulted in  of revenue with no related cost during the company s third quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately to million for the three months ended april  versus million for the three months ended april  however  these expenses decreased by to million for the year ended april  compared to million for the year ended april  the increase in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by three factors 
first  the company expensed approximately  associated with severance agreements 
second  sales commission expense for the fourth quarter of fiscal was approximately  higher than the comparable prior year quarter due to an increase in contract signings 
finally  non project related travel increased by approximately  primarily due to new sales opportunities and development activities 
as a result of the factors noted above  operating income for the three months ended april  increased by  to million from  for the three months ended april  operating income for fiscal increased by  to million versus million for fiscal as more fully described in note of notes to the financial statements  the company recorded a gain of million on the sale of its financial product line during the quarter ended july  an additional gain of  was recognized during the quarter ended january  due to the collection of the final holdback on this transaction in december net other income for the year ended april  increased to  from  for the year ended april  this increase was primarily due to additional interest income earned on the company s cash balances 
in addition  beginning in december of  the company began leasing a portion of the building it acquired in portage  michigan  adjacent to its corporate headquarters 
the company s provision for income taxes generally fluctuates with the level of pretax income 
the effective tax rate was for the quarter ended april  compared to for the quarter ended april  this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of state tax expense for the quarter within the income tax provision 
the effective tax rate for the year ended april  was compared to for the year ended april  while the effective rates appear comparable year over year  the fiscal rate did increase as a result of the inclusion of state taxes  but was offset by a decrease in tax reserves and recognition of deferred tax assets 
net income increased by to  or per diluted share for the quarter ended april  versus net income of  or per diluted share for the quarter ended april  for the year ended april   net income was million or per diluted share  compared to million or per diluted share for the year ended april  approximately million using an effective tax rate of or per diluted share of this increase related to the gain on the sale of the financial product line described in note of the notes to the financial statements 
in addition  fiscal included  of operating income related to the settlement of allegheny county noted previously 
this non recurring settlement positively impacted net income for fiscal by  using an effective tax rate of or per diluted share 
diluted weighted average outstanding common shares increased from million shares to million shares for the year ended april  and from million shares to million shares for the quarter ended april  versus the respective amounts for the three months and year ended april  these increases were due primarily to two factors 
first  the company s average stock price increased to for fiscal from for fiscal this caused substantially all of the company s outstanding options to be included in the diluted eps base 
second  the company issued  shares of stock associated with the proval acquisition during the first quarter of fiscal this was the final payment under the contingent stock post merger agreement 
quarterly results the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly financial data for the last eight quarters fiscal for the quarter ended april  january  october  july  net revenues gross profit income from operations net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share at quarter end cash and short term investments total assets shareholders equity book value per share fiscal for the quarter ended april  january  october  july  net revenues gross profit income from operations net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share at quarter end cash and short term investments total assets shareholders equity book value per share book value per share was calculated by dividing total shareholders equity by the sum of total shares outstanding and total shares pending issuance at the end of the respective periods 
financial condition and liquidity working capital of million at april  increased by compared to the million that was reported at april  these levels reflect current ratios of and  respectively 
the improvement in both working capital and the current ratio is primarily due to the proceeds resulting from the sale of the judicial product line as well as the continued execution of many of the company s more significant projects 
shareholders equity at april  increased by million to million from the balance reported at april  this was due to million of net income   of employee stock purchases  including the associated tax benefit from option exercises  and  of deferred compensation expense 
these increases were offset by  of company stock that was repurchased from certain executives to cover the tax consequences of restricted stock vesting and the repurchase of  of the company s stock on the market
