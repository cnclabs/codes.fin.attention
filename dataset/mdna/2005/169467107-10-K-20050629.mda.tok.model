item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview chindex international  inc is a delaware corporation with headquarters located in the washington  dc metropolitan area 
we were founded in and currently are an american provider of healthcare products and services to china  including hong kong 
we operate in three business segments medical capital equipment division 
this division markets  sells and facilitates the export of select capital healthcare equipment and instrumentation to china on the basis of both exclusive and non exclusive agreements with the manufacturers of these products 
we believe  based on our knowledge and experience in the chinese healthcare system  that we are the largest independent us distributor of healthcare equipment in china 
for the fiscal year ended march   the medical capital equipment division accounted for of our revenue 
healthcare products distribution division 
this division  through a network of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in china  imports and distributes off the shelf healthcare instrumentation and health related consumable products developed by third parties 
for the fiscal year ended march   the healthcare products distribution division accounted for of our revenue 
healthcare services division 
this division operates our private hospitals and clinics 
beijing united family hospital and clinics bju opened in and shanghai united family hospital and clinics shu opened at the end of we have opened satellite clinics associated with our hospitals in both beijing and shanghai 
for the fiscal year ended march   the healthcare services division accounted for of our revenue 
substantially all of our assets are located in china and substantially all our revenues are derived from our operations in china 
accordingly  our business  financial condition and results of operations are subject  to a significant degree  to economic  political and legal developments in china 
the economic system in china differs from the economics of most developed countries in many respects  including government investment  level of development  control of capital investment  control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources 
our medical capital equipment division and healthcare products distribution division are subject to challenges and risks as a result of our dependence on our relations with suppliers of equipment and products 
in addition  the timing of our revenue from the sale of medical capital equipment is affected by the availability of funds to customers in the budgeting processes of those customers  the availability of credit from the chinese banking system and otherwise 
the timing of sales of such equipment may depend on the timing of our customers ability to arrange for credit sources 
further  because we recognize revenue and expenses relating to certain contracts as such products are shipped  the timing of shipments  among other things  affects our operating results for a particular period 
consequently  our operating results have varied and are expected to continue to vary from period to period 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include revenue recognition  receivable collectibility and income tax recognition of deferred tax items 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition sales of equipment and healthcare products are recognized upon product shipment 
we provide installation  warranty  and training services for certain of our capital equipment sales 
these services are viewed as perfunctory to the overall arrangement and are not accounted for separately from the equipment sale 
costs associated with installation  after sale servicing and warranty are not significant and are recognized in cost of sales as they are incurred 
the estimated cost for training services is accrued upon shipment 
revenue related to services provided in our healthcare services segment is recognized in the period services are provided 
revenue includes an estimate of services at the end of the period for patients who have not completed service 
costs associated with such services are recognized in the period incurred 
receivable collectibility we grant credit to some customers in the ordinary course of business 
we evaluate collectibility of accounts receivable periodically and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly 
bad debts are experienced predominately in the healthcare services business and to a lesser extent in the medical capital equipment business 
we have experienced few losses in the healthcare products distribution business 
we incurred bad debt expense in healthcare services of   and  in the years ended march  and  and three months ended march   respectively and  in the remaining two divisions only for the year ended march  in addition  we increased the reserve for doubtful accounts from  at march  to  at march  as the result of a detailed review of accounts receivable 
valuation allowance of deferred tax assets our operations are taxed in various jurisdictions including the united states and china 
in certain jurisdictions individual subsidiaries are taxed separately 
we have identified deferred tax assets resulting from cumulative temporary differences at each balance sheet date 
a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which we are unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized 
we have provided substantial deferred tax valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets related to various subsidiaries in china in the year ended march  because we are not able to conclude that it is more likely than not that those assets will be realized 
we released deferred tax valuation allowances totaling  in the year ended december  based on assessments in those years that it was more likely than not that we would be able to use our us federal net operating loss carryforwards 
certain of these benefits were realized in tax filings for the period ended march these us net operating loss carryforwards do not expire before fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  general our revenue for was  up from revenue of  we experienced continued revenue growth in the medical capital equipment and healthcare services segments  with revenue growth of in the medical capital equipment segment and in the healthcare services segment  as compared to the prior year 
we experienced a decrease in revenue over the prior year in our healthcare products distribution segment  the reasons for which are discussed below 
costs and expenses were  for fiscal as compared with costs and expenses of  for fiscal the increased costs in particular segments are discussed below 
in general  however  greater than anticipated increased costs were experienced principally in the healthcare services segment in connection with the expansion of hospital services in beijing and the commencement of services in shanghai and to a lesser extent in the other two segments 
we recorded a net loss of  for fiscal  as compared to a net loss of  for fiscal there were a number of increased costs at the parent level of the company  including significant increases related to local entity excise taxes and increased corporate governance  including in general sarbanes oxley compliance and in particular preparation for compliance with section thereof and an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the largest parent level increases  which have been allocated among the segments as described below  include increased payroll of  and increased professional fees of  both substantially related to compliance and corporate reporting  increased excise taxes of  and increased rent of  our business operations in fiscal will focus on cost reduction programs at the corporate level and cost containment programs at the operating division level 
we expect continued growth generally in line with levels achieved in in the medical capital equipment and healthcare services segments 
we have reorganized certain hospital product offerings in the healthcare products distribution division and have initiated a search for a strategic partner in the retail pharmacy business unit of that segment 
medical capital equipment segment the medical capital equipment segment exports high quality western medical capital equipment to the china market 
in fiscal  this segment had revenue of  a increase over revenue of  in fiscal the revenue increase reflects the continued development of and revenue from new sales channels for our capital medical equipment  involving greater use of local chinese sub distributors  as well as the fact that sars was a significant negative factor in the prior year 
finally  the addition of a new range of medium priced ultrasound products from siemens enabled us to penetrate new market segments  thus helping to increase sales 
gross profit for the medical equipment segment in fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal  and as a percentage of revenue was in the recent year as compared to in the prior year 
the reduction in gross profit margin is a function of the increased use of channel sales  ie sales through chinese subdistributors where the available commission to the company is slightly less than in a direct sale 
sales under government backed financing arrangements also are made at lower gross profit margins and the gross profit margin may trend downward in those periods where we have significant loan and channel sales 
expenses for the medical capital equipment segment in fiscal increased to  from  in the twelve months ended march  and  as a percentage of revenue over the periods  decreased to from 
salaries for the segment in fiscal increased by  over fiscal  and as a percentage of revenue was compared to for the twelve months ended march  other costs increased  over the periods  primarily due to the segment s allocated portion of additional parent level administrative expenses and bad debt expenses 
the segment had a loss from operation of  in the recent period  compared with a loss from operations of  in the prior period 
in fiscal the medical capital equipment segment will focus on cost containment and expansion of market penetration primarily through continuing growth in the use of local subdistributor networks 
we will also intend to continue to add new products and technologies to our offerings 
healthcare products distribution segment the healthcare products distribution segment distributes medical consumables and healthcare products from inventories maintained locally in china to a network of sub dealers and pharmacies on a local currency basis 
in fiscal  this segment had a decrease in revenue of to  as compared to revenue of  in fiscal the decrease in revenue during the recent period was attributable to faster than expected phase out of third party logistics services  the readjustment of distribution territories by a large supplier and delays in the program for the rollout of additional branded products in the retail pharmacy business 
gross profit in fiscal decreased to  from  in the twelve months ended march  as a percentage of revenue  gross profit from the healthcare products distribution segment for the current year was  approximately the same percentage as in the prior year 
we encountered increased pricing pressures from our current suppliers and thus did not realize the expected increase in gross profit margin 
in addition  with respect to our retail product sales through chinese pharmacies  as part of the annual distributor agreement review process  effective january  our territory for one large supplier was significantly reduced 
although  as noted above  this reduction led to decreased revenues in the current period  going forward we intend to offset this decrease to a significant extent with an increase in the number of pharmacy outlets covered in the retained provinces based on our supplier s announced intention to expand market penetration 
expenses for the healthcare products distribution segment in fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal  and increased to as a percentage of revenue as compared to for prior period 
salaries for the segment increased  primarily due to the timing of payment of bonuses to employees 
in addition  other expenses increased  primarily due to the segment s allocated portion of additional parent level administrative costs  increased promotion expenses of  and bad debt expense 
the segment had a loss from operations of  in the recent period  compared with a loss from operations of  in the prior period 
in fiscal the healthcare products distribution segment will focus on cost containment and strategic positioning of the retail pharmacy business unit 
we have begun exploring opportunities to diversify our supplier base through strategic relationships with other potential business partners 
healthcare services segment during fiscal  the healthcare services segment consisted of an international standard private healthcare facility  beijing united family hospital and clinics bju  an affiliated satellite clinic in beijing  our new hospital in shanghai  shanghai united family hospital and clinics shu  and a clinic affiliated with shu 
for the first nine months of fiscal  shu was in development 
shu received its operating license from the chinese government on october  and held its opening ceremony on october  shu was considered fully operational as of january  when inpatient services began 
development costs related to shu were  for the nine month period  an increase from  in fiscal for fiscal  the revenue from the segment was  an increase of over fiscal revenue of  the increased revenues were primarily attributable to growth in patient volumes partially due to increased services in the beijing market and to a lesser degree the opening of the new facility in shanghai 
during the prior year the hospital was significantly impacted by the sars crisis in beijing  which was principally responsible for the loss in that year 
healthcare services operating costs increased for fiscal to  a increase over fiscal costs of  salaries increased by  salaries were and of revenue for fiscal years and  respectively 
these increases were due primarily to the costs associated with increased services offered  the period of preparation for jci accreditation at the bju facility and three months opening of the shanghai facilities 
other costs increased  primarily due to increases in direct patient care expenses  other professional fees  excise taxes and depreciation 
the healthcare services segment had a loss from operations of  including  of development expenses in fiscal  compared with a loss from operations of  including  of development expenses in the prior year 
in fiscal the healthcare services segment will focus on cost containment and continued growth in both the beijing and shanghai markets 
subject to the availability of capital  we will continue to ramp up operations in shanghai  expand services at all facilities and open a new affiliated satellite clinic in beijing 
we also expect to receive jci accreditation for our main facility in beijing during the year 
other income and expenses interest expense incurred on short term capitalized leases of  short term debt of  long term capitalized leases of  and long term debt of  amounted to  whereas we had  in the prior period 
interest expense of  for the current period is net of  of capitalized interest 
the long term debt is for the development of shu see liquidity and capital resources 
there was no capitalized interest in the prior year because no substantial borrowings had occurred 
taxes we recorded a  benefit from taxes in fiscal as compared to a provision for taxes of  for fiscal our deferred tax asset increased by  we also recorded an additional valuation allowance of  that relates primarily to the china operations 
the valuation allowance was recorded due to the conclusion that the realization of the tax benefit is currently unknown for the china operations 
the remaining tax benefit of  was recorded for the us operations 
this tax computation is in accordance with current accounting standards but assumes a certain level of future profitability 
we believe the recognition of the  in deferred tax assets properly recognizes the benefits we have achieved as a result of our tax restructuring and expect to utilize a substantial portion of the loss carry forward benefit in fiscal years and we have provided a valuation allowance on deferred tax benefits related to losses incurred at shanghai united  since it has no operating history to support a conclusion that realization of the tax benefit is more likely than not 
fiscal compared to twelve months ended december  general our revenue for fiscal was  up from the twelve months ended december  revenue of  we experienced continued revenue growth in each of the three segments of the business  with revenue growth of in the medical capital equipment segment  in the healthcare products distribution segment  and in the healthcare services segment  compared to the twelve months ended december  the growth in revenue in the medical capital equipment and healthcare products distribution segments was primarily a result of increased marketing and sales efforts and expense 
the growth in revenue in the healthcare services segment was primarily a result of expanded services offered at beijing united  including the addition of staff to support those services 
costs and expenses were  for fiscal as compared with costs and expenses of  for the twelve months ended december  we recorded a net loss of  for fiscal  as compared to net income of  for the twelve months ended december  each of our three segments experienced an operating loss in fiscal we believe that there are three principal reasons for the loss from operations for the fiscal year 
first  the fiscal year was marked by the extraordinary experience of dealing with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars  which had a significant negative impact in a variety of ways on our business 
normal beijing business activity came to a near standstill resulting in the delay of contract negotiations for the sale of medical capital equipment and hospital visits were far below our expectations as foreign residents in beijing left the capital 
second  the lack of government sponsored loan programs in the period also adversely impacted the volume of our sales 
third  we continued to incur operational expenses in connection with shu  while the opening of that hospital was delayed due to a number of factors 
cost increases for the segments are discussed below 
there were a number of increased costs at our parent level  including for an upgrade of our data systems in china and new offices in beijing 
the largest parent level increases  which have been allocated among the segments as described below  include increased payroll of  increased professional fees of  increased accounting and legal fees of  and increased rent of  medical capital equipment segment the medical capital equipment segment exports high quality western medical capital equipment to the china market 
in fiscal  this segment had revenue of  an increase over revenue of  in the twelve months ended december  loss from operations was  in fiscal compared with income from operations of  in the twelve months ended december  gross profit in fiscal increased to  from  in the twelve months ended december  gross profit margin for the medical capital equipment segment for the recent fiscal year was as compared to in the prior period 
expenses for the medical capital equipment segment in fiscal increased to  from  in the twelve months ended december  and  as a percentage of revenue over the periods  increased to from 
payroll for the segment in fiscal increased by  over payroll in the twelve months ended december   and as a percentage of revenue was compared to for the twelve months ended december  the payroll increase was primarily due to increased sales personnel in connection with expanding the marketing of the segment s products 
in addition  travel and entertainment expenses for the segment increased  other costs increased  over the periods  primarily due to the segment s allocated portion of additional parent level administrative expenses and higher costs for new customs fees related to parts purchases  promotion  meeting expenses and telephones 
healthcare products distribution segment the healthcare products distribution segment  consisting of medical consumables and personal healthcare products  had revenue growth of to  fiscal  as compared to revenue of  in the twelve months ended december  the segment had a loss from operations of  in the recent fiscal year  compared with a loss from operations of  in the twelve months ended december  we anticipate that revenue growth in this segment will be slower as several customers contemplate and effectuate direct sales and new products are subjected to an increasingly formalized chinese regulatory process 
for example  one significant client  becton dickenson  had recently established a subsidiary in china that performs the logistical services previously performed by our healthcare products distribution division 
another client  guidant  established a similar subsidiary in china 
this transition away from lower margin logistical services is consistent with the division s strategy of prioritizing higher margin business 
with respect to delays in the chinese regulatory process  the launch of new products required longer lead times  due to the fact that china s regulatory environment is becoming more professional  bureaucratic and transparent  resulting in longer regulatory cycle time 
during the regulatory approval process  some products that the division planned to launch encountered delays 
the division s local currency sales of medical consumables and personal healthcare products are made from inventories maintained locally in china see foreign currency exchange and impact of inflation to a network of sub dealers and pharmacies 
gross profit in fiscal rose to  from  in the twelve months ended december  gross profit margin from the healthcare products distribution segment decreased to for the fiscal year from for the twelve months ended december  expenses for the healthcare products distribution segment in fiscal increased to  from  in the twelve months ended december   but decreased to as a percentage of revenue as compared to for the twelve months ended december  payroll for the segment increased  primarily due to increased staff compensation 
in addition  travel and entertainment expense for the segment was relatively unchanged while other costs increased  due primarily to the segment s allocated portion of additional parent level administrative costs  increased other professional fees of  and  in promotion 
healthcare services segment the healthcare services segment consists of two western style primary care hospitals  beijing united family hospital and clinics bju and shanghai united family hospital and clinics shu  which continued to be under construction  as well as an affiliated satellite clinic in beijing 
for fiscal  the revenue from this segment was  an increase of over the twelve months ended december  revenue of  the segment had a loss from operations of  in the recent fiscal year  compared with income from operations of  for the twelve months ended december  during the recent fiscal year  the hospital was significantly negatively impacted by the sars crisis in beijing 
many of bju s expatriate patients left the country and many others deferred visits during the april to august period 
healthcare services costs increased for fiscal to  a increase over the twelve months ended december  costs of  this increase was due primarily to the costs associated with adding to bju dermatology services and an intensive care unit plus  of operating expenses of the not yet open shu facility 
payroll increased by  payroll was of revenue for fiscal and for the twelve months ended december   with all other costs increasing a total of  including increases of  in bad debt accounts   in other professional fees and  in depreciation 
during fiscal  in the process of the ongoing roll out of our new clinical and financial reporting systems throughout this segment  we completed a review of all accounts receivable reflected on our predecessor systems 
the increase in our bad debt accounts over periods is primarily based on our determinations in that review that certain patients and or responsible parties had departed china or otherwise practically became unreachable 
the rollout of our new systems also impacted our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition to our normal reviews  the review of all accounts in connection with the roll out resulted in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts from  at december  to  at march  our new systems are designed to better monitor our accounts receivable aging 
the opening of shu  which was originally scheduled for the fall of  did not occur until the fall of the delay in opening the new hospital was due to a number of factors 
during the sars epidemic  travel between beijing and shanghai was very difficult and proved a major disruption in the schedule 
after the sars experience ended  we decided to reevaluate the shu design in light of lessons learned during the epidemic 
as a result of this reevaluation  a number of specific design changes were made  such as adding a fever clinic  changing the air conditioning system and increasing the number of rooms where negative pressure could be utilized 
loss on equity investment we recorded an additional equity investment loss of  in fiscal year  which represents our pro rata share of additional capital for natural formula asia nfal  a joint venture in which we have a interest 
the joint venture purchases various cosmetics made by nesh  an israeli cosmetics manufacturer  and sells such products into china through pharmacy channels developed by us 
our investment is in the form of a loan to the joint venture 
the loan  which was accrued but not yet executed as of march   bears interest at the rate of commencing may   has no stated maturity date and may be prepaid 
we reported a loss of  for this venture in the year ended december  other income and expenses interest expense on short term capitalized leases of  short term debt of  and long term capitalized leases of  amounted to  whereas we had  the prior period 
over  of short term debt is for the development of shu that is currently under construction see liquidity and capital resources 
taxes we recorded a  provision for taxes in fiscal as compared to a benefit from taxes of  for the twelve months ended december  our deferred tax asset increased by  this tax computation is in accordance with current accounting standards but assumes a certain level of future profitability 
we believe this properly recognizes the benefits we have achieved as a result of our tax restructuring and expect to utilize a substantial portion of the loss carry forward benefit in fiscal years and we have provided a valuation allowance on deferred tax benefits related to development expenses incurred at shanghai united  since it has no operating history to support a conclusion that realization of the tax benefit is more likely than not 
three months ended march  compared to three months ended march  transition our revenue for the three months ended march  was  up from the three months ended march  revenue of  we experienced continued growth in each of the three segments of the business  with revenue growth of in the medical capital equipment segment  in the healthcare products distribution segment  and in the healthcare service segment  compared to the same period last year 
we recorded net income of  for the three months ended march   as compared to a net loss of  for the three months ended march  medical capital equipment segment in the three months ended march   the medical capital equipment segment had revenue of  a increase over revenue of  in the three months ended march  income from operations was  in the recent period compared with a loss from operations of  in the prior period 
gross profit in the three months ended march  increased to  from  in the three months ended march  gross profit margin for this segment for the recent period was as compared to in the prior period 
the increase in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to two factors 
first  we had made this a priority for our sales staff and instituted additional reporting and reviewed margin issues on a contract by contract basis 
accordingly  where a salesperson might previously have been inclined to accept an offer from a customer to purchase our equipment at a less than optimum margin  the salesperson knew that the contract would be reviewed critically once it was brought back to our senior review staff 
this created an additional incentive for the salesperson to seek better pricing from the customer 
second  in the recent period there were no loan program sales  which typically are at a lower gross margin because we are not required to provide warranty service 
thus  in periods where there are loan program sales  such as the three months ended march   the average gross profit margin is often lower because of the inclusion of these lower margin loan sales in the mix 
further  to the extent  as we intend  that in future periods a larger portion of sales are made through sub dealers  which are local chinese distributors  then our gross profit margin may be proportionately lower 
sub dealers represent an additional layer in the distribution process and their compensation reduces our profit 
they purchase our products and resell them to customer hospitals 
we cannot yet quantify the impact such increase might have or the extent thereof and the related cost cannot as yet be determined 
expenses for the medical capital equipment segment in the three months ended march  increased to  from  in the three months ended march  and as a percentage of revenue over the periods increased to from 
salaries for the segment in the three months ended march  increased by  from the three months ended march   and as a percentage of revenue over the periods increased to from 
the salary increase was primarily due to increased payroll benefits mandated by the chinese government and increased commissions 
in addition  travel and entertainment expenses for the segment decreased  other costs increased  over the periods  primarily due to additional administrative expenses offset by lower costs for exhibitions 
healthcare products distribution segment the healthcare products distribution segment had revenue growth of to  in the three months ended march   as compared to revenue of  in the three months ended march  the segment had a loss from operations of  in the recent period  compared with a loss from operations of  in the prior period 
the large revenue growth over the periods is attributed to a temporary arrangement with an existing client to handle part of their product line that we had not previously handled and that we will not handle in the future 
the remaining increase in revenue was caused by growth across multiple product lines resulting from strong demand for healthcare and consumer products by our chinese customers as well as our strong competitive position and management 
gross profit in the three months ended march  rose to  from  in the three months ended march  gross profit margin from the healthcare products segment for the recent period was as compared to in the prior period 
the decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to the low margin non recurring sale mentioned above 
expenses for the healthcare products distribution segment in the three months ended march  increased to  from  in the three months ended march   but decreased as a percentage of revenue over the periods to from 
payroll for the segment increased  primarily due to increased staff compensation 
in addition  travel and entertainment expense for the segment increased  but was flat at of revenue for both periods and other costs increased  due primarily to increased promotion expense and costs relating to facilities 
healthcare services segment for the three months ended march   the revenue from this segment was  an increase of over the three months ended march  revenue of  the segment had a loss from operations of  in the recent period  compared with income from operations of  in the prior period 
during the recent period  the hospital completed the million expansion of its beijing facility  which contributed to increased patient visits as well as increased inpatient stays over the periods 
total inpatient days in the hospital increased to in the three months ended march  from in the three months ended march   an increase of 
for outpatient clinic visits  total clinic visits increased to  in the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   an increase of 
healthcare services costs increased over the periods from  to  this increase was due primarily to the costs associated with expanded services offered 
payroll increased by  payroll was and of revenue for the three months ended march  and  respectively  with all other costs increasing  including increases of  in development expenses related to shu   in doubtful accounts reserve   in professional fees and  in rent expense 
other income and expenses interest expense on short term debt of  and long term debt of  amounted to  whereas we had little expense in the prior period 
the long term debt relates to the development of shu that is currently under construction see liquidity and capital resources 
taxes we recorded an  provision for taxes for the three months ended march  as compared to a benefit from taxes of  for the three months ended march  liquidity and capital resources as of march   our cash and cash equivalents  net accounts receivable and net inventories were   and  respectively  as compared to   and  respectively  as of march  as of march   our short term loan payable was comprised entirely of bank loans of  bju has a short term financing arrangement in china with the hong kong and shanghai banking corporation hsbc for  in revolving loans bearing interest at over the three month singapore interbank money market offer rate sibor 
also  a line of credit is included in the arrangement with hsbc for up to  bearing interest at over sibor and having a term of up to three years 
as of march   the balances on these credit lines were  and  respectively 
the remaining  of short term loan payable is the current portion of a million loan facility for shu with hsbc 
we opened our hospital facility in shanghai in october  the cost of which was financed through i vendor financing ii local bank borrowings and iii proceeds of the sale of million shares of common stock and warrants 
the local bank borrowing for shu consists of the million loan facility with hsbc referenced above  which was fully utilized during calendar of this loan  in addition to the  that is classified as short term   is classified as long term 
the long term facility has a five year term and an interest rate of over the six month sibor 
we have guaranteed the full amount of the hsbc facilities 
as of march   letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately  were outstanding and we had no borrowings outstanding under our  credit facility with m t bank  which remains available 
the borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at over the three month london interbank offered rate libor 
in fiscal  we also received a portion of the net proceeds of a sale of million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares at an exercise price of per share  which proceeds were received on march  april and may  the private placement 
although the total net proceeds from the private placement were approximately million  the amount received in fiscal was approximately million 
such net proceeds were used to repay a portion of our vendor financing  for capital expenditures  and for working capital purposes 
at the end of fiscal  we consummated a second sale of shares of common stock and warrants the private placement 
in connection therewith  on march   the company received approximately million of net proceeds for the sale of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares at an exercise price of per share 
the net proceeds were used for working capital purposes 
over the next twelve months we anticipate capital expenditures of million  however  substantially all of these expenditures are expected to be elective and subject to the availability of capital 
we intend to finance these expenditures as well as our other cash requirements principally through availability under a vendor financing arrangement available through august  which provides for up to million in credit facilities at an interest rate of per annum 
each grant of credit under the facility expires after months to be replaced by subsequent purchases and payables 
in addition we intend to finance expenditures through additional bank loans  to the extent available  as well as through current cash and cash flow from operations 
with respect to bank financing  we have been engaged in discussions in china with several local and international banks after an increase in our existing credit facility from hsbc was not forthcoming 
we continue to consider various other financing alternatives to satisfy our future expansion  capital improvements and equipment requirements 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing we may have to curtail or terminate certain operations 
we continue to consider various other financing alternatives to satisfy our future expansion  capital improvements and equipment requirements 
the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of march  thousands total thereafter line of credit bank loan vendor financing capital leases operating leases total contractual obligations for information about these contractual obligations  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
timing of revenue the timing of our revenue is affected by several factors 
the sales of certain products sold by our medical capital equipment division often require protracted sales efforts  long lead times and other time consuming steps 
for example  many end users are required to purchase capital equipment through a formal tendering process which often entails an extended period of time before the sale can be completed 
further  in light of the dependence by purchasers of capital equipment on the availability of credit  the timing of sales may depend upon the timing of our or our purchasers abilities to arrange for credit sources  including loans from local chinese banks or financing from international loan programs such as those offered by export import bank 
as a result  our operating results have varied and are expected to continue to vary from period to period and year to year 
in addition  a relatively limited number of orders and shipments may constitute a meaningful percentage of our revenue in any one period 
as a result  a relatively small reduction in the number of orders can have a material impact on our revenue in any year 
further  because we recognize revenue and expense as products are shipped  the timing of shipments could affect our operating results for a particular period 
at the same time  a significant percentage of our revenue is attributable to hospital services and local currency sales through the hpd  both of which have more even revenue streams 
foreign currency exchange and impact of inflation our results of operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuation 
since we receive over of our revenue in local chinese currency  we have some foreign currency risk 
changes in the valuation of the chinese renminbi or hong kong dollar may have an impact on our results of operations in the future 
our subsidiaries  chindex tianjin  chindex shanghai  beijing united  and shanghai united  sell products and services in renminbi 
for over years the chinese and hong kong dollars have been pegged to the us dollar 
while discussions about the possible removal of this pegged rate have been in the news we do not believe at this time any change is imminent 
also  chinese currency is not freely tradable and we do not hedge our transactions 
we monitor the situation globally and continue to keep up with the discussion 
while there can be no assurances that a change will not occur  we do not believe any such change will have a material adverse effect 
we also have purchased and will continue to purchase some products in freely transferable western currencies other than us dollars and have sold and will continue to sell such products in china for us dollars 
to the extent that the value of the us dollar declines against such a currency  we could experience a negative impact on profitability 
we anticipate hedging transactions wherever possible to minimize such negative impacts 
currently there are no such hedges 
as part of our risk management program  we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue  operating results  cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates 
our sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of the rmb to the us dollar at march   indicated that if the us dollar uniformly increased in value by percent relative to the rmb  then we would have experienced a smaller loss 
conversely  a percent increase in the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar at march  would have resulted in a additional loss 
if the chinese government decides to adjust the value of the rmb so that it increases in value as against the us dollar  we may respond with adjustments to our operating processes so as to improve the benefit to the company of such a change 
for example  we could increase the proportion of capital equipment that we sell in rmb instead of in us dollars 
moreover  our us sourced products would be cheaper for our customers  thus improving our competitive position vis vis products from some other countries 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below  together with all of the other information included in this annual report on form k 
the following risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face 
however  these are the risks our management believes are material 
if any of the following risks actually materialize  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
this report contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties such as those listed below and elsewhere in this report  which  among others  should be considered in evaluating our future performance 
risks related to our business and financial condition our business is capital intensive and we may not be able to access the capital markets when we would like to raise capital 
we may not be able to raise adequate capital to complete some or all of our business strategies or to react rapidly to changes in technology  products  services or the competitive landscape 
healthcare product and services providers in china often face high capital requirements in order to take advantage of new market opportunities  respond to rigorous competitive pressures and react quickly to changes in technology 
many of our competitors are committing substantial capital and  in many instances  are forming alliances to acquire or maintain market leadership 
our business is capital intensive and there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our capital requirements in the future 
in particular  our strategy in the business of providing healthcare services includes the establishment and maintenance of healthcare facilities  which require significant capital 
in addition  we plan to develop our own brand of baby care products and to expand our distribution capabilities 
in the absence of available capital  we would be unable to establish or maintain healthcare facilities as planned  and would be unable to expand our business as planned 
we do not presently have sufficient capital resources to implement most of our expansion plans in the absence of improved financial performance  as to which there can be no assurance 
we may not generate sufficient cash flow to fund our capital expenditures  ongoing operations and indebtedness obligations 
our ability to service our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash flow 
our ability to generate cash flow is dependent on many factors  including our future operating performance  the demand for our products and services  general economic conditions and conditions affecting suppliers  customers and patients  competition and our ability to stabilize customer losses  and legal and regulatory factors affecting us and our business 
some of these factors are beyond our control 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow  we may not be able to repay indebtedness  operate our business  respond to competition  pursue our growth strategy  which is capital intensive  or otherwise meet cash requirements 
we experienced a net loss in each of fiscal and fiscal and may continue to experience net losses 
consequently  we may not have the ability to finance future operations 
we experienced a net loss in each of fiscal and fiscal these net losses are principally attributable to increased costs  including at our parent level  primarily as a result of corporate governance compliance and local taxes  in our medical capital equipment division  primarily as a result of increased salaries and bad debt allowances  in our healthcare products distribution division  primarily as a result of pricing and other pressures from suppliers and limitations on the availability of financing to our customers  and  in our healthcare services division  primarily as a result of start up and service expansion expenses relating to hospital operations in shanghai  including increases in staff  insurance costs  supplies and other expenses 
we expect that  while many of these expenses will diminish now that the operations in shanghai have been commenced  expenses in connection with maintenance and operation  as well as expansion  if any  of our healthcare services division will remain significant 
in addition  we recently experienced a reduction in territories covered for a large supplier in the healthcare products distribution division  which we intend to offset in part by increased sales  as to which there can be no assurances  in the retained territories 
continued losses would reduce our cash available from operations to service our indebtedness  as well as limit our ability to finance our operations 
if we fail to manage our growth or maintain adequate internal accounting  disclosure and other controls  we would lose the ability to manage our business effectively and or experience errors or information lapses affecting public reporting 
we have expanded our operations rapidly in recent years and continue to explore ways to extend our product and service offerings 
our growth may place a strain on our management systems  information systems  resources and internal controls 
our ability to successfully distribute products and offer services requires adequate information systems and resources and oversight from senior management 
we will need to modify and improve our financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures and other internal control and compliance procedures as we continue to grow and expand our business 
if we are unable to manage our growth and improve our controls  systems and procedures  they may be ineffective  we may be unable to operate efficiently and we may lose the ability to manage many other aspects of our business effectively and or experience errors or information lapses affecting public reporting 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met  and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected 
if we are not successful in discovering and eliminating weaknesses in internal controls  then we will lose the ability to manage our business effectively 
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of could have a material adverse effect on our ability to ensure timely and reliable financial reporting 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires our management to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  our internal control over financial reporting 
we are actively continuing our ongoing process of documenting  testing and evaluating the effectiveness of  and remediating any issues identified related to  our internal control over financial reporting 
the process of documenting  testing and evaluating our internal control over financial reporting is complex and time consuming 
due to this complexity and the time consuming nature of the process and because currently unforeseen events or circumstances beyond our control could arise  we cannot assure you that we ultimately will be able to comply fully with section in our annual report on form k for the year ending march  or that we will be able to conclude our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of the date 
we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section  which could adversely affect public confidence in our ability to record  process  summarize and report financial data to ensure timely and reliable external financial reporting 
if we lost the services of our key personnel  then our leadership  expertise  experience  business relationships  strategic and operating planning and other important business attributes would be diminished 
our success to a large extent depends upon the continued services of certain executive officers  particularly roberta lipson  the chief executive officer and president and elyse beth silverberg  our executive vice president and secretary 
we have entered into an employment agreement with ms 
lipson that contains non competition  non solicitation and confidentiality provisions  and we maintain key person life insurance coverage in the amount of  on the life of ms 
lipson 
ms 
silverberg is subject to an employment agreement that contains non competition  non solicitation and provisions  but we do not maintain an insurance policy on her life 
the loss of service of any of our key employees could diminish our leadership  expertise  experience  business relationships  strategic and operating planning and other important business attributes  thus materially harming our business 
our business could be adversely affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuation 
since we receive more than of our revenues in local chinese currency with the remainder in us dollars  we have foreign currency risk 
contracts denominated in us dollars  where the goods are purchased in us dollars  would not be subject to foreign currency risk 
in the event of a decline in the value of the us dollar  however  goods that are purchased by us in us dollars and resold in chinese renminbi would become more competitive in the chinese market  which would allow us to either reduce prices and increase quantities or maintain prices at a higher gross profit margin 
similarly  changes in the valuation of the chinese renminbi or hong kong dollar may have an impact on our results of operations in the future 
our subsidiaries  chindex tianjin  chindex shanghai  beijing united  and shanghai united  sell products and services in renminbi 
we have also purchased and will continue to purchase some products in western currencies other than us dollars and have sold and will continue to sell such products in china for us dollars 
to the extent that the value of the us dollar declines against such western currencies  we could experience a negative impact on profitability 
we anticipate hedging transactions wherever possible to minimize the impact from exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
we have limited hedging experience and there can be no assurance that such strategies will be successful in eliminating or reducing our risk 
currently there are no such hedges 
as part of our risk management program  we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue  operating results  cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates 
our sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of the rmb to the us dollar at march   indicated that if the us dollar uniformly increased in value by relative to the rmb  then we would experience a smaller loss 
conversely  a increase in the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar at march  would have resulted in a additional loss 
risks relating to our medical capital equipment and healthcare products distribution divisions we depend on our relations with suppliers and would be adversely affected by the termination of arrangements with  or shortage or loss of any significant product line from  them 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers that account for a significant portion of our revenues 
during the fiscal year ended march   siemens  guidant and l oreal represented  and of our product revenue and were the only suppliers where such percentage was at least 
during the fiscal year ended march   siemens  guidant  l oreal and becton dickenson represented   and of our revenue and were the only suppliers where such percentage was at least 
during the twelve months ended december   siemens  becton dickenson and l oreal represented  and of our revenue and were the only suppliers where such percentage was at least 
although a substantial number of our relationships with our capital equipment suppliers are pursuant to exclusive contracts  including siemens but not the other suppliers named above  with which we have a year contract terminable for failure to meet sale objectives  the relationships are based substantially on mutual satisfaction in addition to the terms of the contractual arrangements 
our agreement with siemens expires on september  our agreement with guidant expires on december  an agreement with l oreal  which was recently renewed and revised  expires on december  and represents a reduction in territories from those serviced under the predecessor agreement  and automatically renews for successive one year periods unless notice is given by either party of intent to allow the agreement to expire 
our agreement with tyco renews annually effective july unless either party provides notice of intent to let it expire 
our agreement with becton dickenson  which we no longer represent  expired by its terms on december  none of these agreements contains short term cancellation provisions  except typical provisions allowing cancellation for breach of contract  bankruptcy  change of ownership  etc 
certain of our contracts with our other suppliers contain short term cancellation provisions permitting the contracts to be terminated on short notice from days to six months  minimum sales quantity requirements or targets and provisions triggering termination upon the occurrence of certain events 
from time to time  we and or our suppliers terminate or revise their respective distribution arrangements 
we are currently in negotiations with one of our large suppliers 
there can be no assurance that cancellations of or other material adverse effects on our contracts will not occur 
as an example of the foregoing risk  as previously disclosed  one significant client  becton dickenson  of our healthcare products distribution business recently established a subsidiary in china that perform certain services previously performed by that division 
in that example  we did not have a binding contractual arrangement limiting becton dickenson s decision to internalize rather than outsource to us those services 
there can be no assurance that our suppliers will not elect to change their method of distribution into the chinese marketplace to a form that does not use our services 
timing of revenues and fluctuations in financial performance vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are not necessarily indicative of our performance over longer periods 
the timing of our revenues is affected by several significant factors 
many end users of the capital equipment that we sell depend to a certain extent upon the availability of funds in the budgeting processes of the chinese government and the availability of credit from the chinese banking system and otherwise 
these processes and the availability of credit fluctuate in amounts and timing because they are based on policy determinations by the chinese government and the discretion of financial institutions 
further  in light of the dependence by purchasers on the availability of credit  the timing of sales may depend upon the timing of our or our purchasers abilities to arrange for credit sources 
a relatively limited number of orders and shipments of capital equipment may constitute a meaningful percentage of our revenues in any one period 
correspondingly  a relatively small reduction in the number of orders can have a material impact on our revenues in any one quarter or year 
in addition  because we recognize revenues and expenses relating to certain contracts as products are shipped  the timing of shipments affects our operating results for a particular period 
as a result  our operating results have varied and are expected to continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and our results of operations for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any subsequent quarter or related fiscal year 
we have not been able to obtain in every year financings  from third party banks or governments  for our customers and future periodic financings obtained for our customers cannot be assured  their impact on a fiscal period may be more concentrated than the related procurement period  the absence of these financings results in lower sales 
although none were obtained during fiscal or fiscal  periodic financings obtained for customers have had a positive impact on our results of operations during the periods in which they are consummated  including the twelve months ended december  and  and may not be indicative of future results 
as an example of these financings  pursuant to three separate export import bank financing arrangements  we recognized approximately million  million and million  respectively  in sales as a result of the shipments of capital equipment sold to end users from to during the fiscal years ended december     and  sales pursuant to these arrangements constituted approximately    and  respectively  of our total sales 
arrangements for the first of these financings began in mid and revenues from that first financing were recognized in  arrangements for the second of these financings began in early and million of revenues from that second financing were recognized in and the balance was recognized in  and arrangements for the third of these financings began in late and million of revenues from that third financing were recognized in and the balance was recognized in these sales and financings had been arranged over a long period of time  prior to our recognition of the revenue for them 
as a result of the financings  we recognized relatively substantial sales during relatively short periods 
accordingly  our results of operations for the respective fiscal quarters during which the sales were reflected were significantly and positively impacted by the timing of the payments from the financing and were not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for any other quarter or fiscal year 
the can be no assurance that any export import bank financing commitments will be obtained by us for our customers in the future 
the absence of these financings would continue to have an adverse impact on our sales volume 
the relevant agencies of the chinese and us governments had negotiated for several years with the export import bank on a new framework for government supported loan programs  during which period all such loan programs were postponed or unavailable 
on january   however  the bank and the chinese ministry of finance signed the new framework agreement setting forth the terms under which government supported financings will be provided from the us and implemented in china 
consequently  potential hospital customers interested in using this type of financing to purchase us sourced equipment from us had to await such approval 
although the new framework agreement will now permit financing arrangements with the bank to resume  and we have announced our intention to obtain such financing  there can be no assurances that any such arrangements will be reached or consummated 
we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls  and in the future we may not be able to obtain insurance against these claims at a reasonable cost or at all 
the nature of our business exposes us to potential product liability risks  which are inherent in the distribution of medical equipment and healthcare products 
we may not be able to avoid product liability exposure  since third parties develop and manufacture our equipment and products 
if a product liability claim is successfully brought against us or any of these third party manufacturers  or if a significant product recall occurs  then we would experience adverse consequences to our reputation  we might be required to pay damages  our insurance  legal and other expenses would increase  we might lose customers and or suppliers and there may be other adverse results 
we do not maintain product liability insurance  but we do request that we be named as an additional insured on policies held by our manufacturers 
there can be no assurance that one or more liability claims will not exceed the coverage limits of any of such policies 
we currently represent approximately manufacturers and currently are named as an additional insured on of of those manufacturers that we have approached in this regard 
since most products handled by us do not involve invasive measures  they do not represent a significant risk from product liability 
guidant  however  is one of the manufacturers with respect to which we have been added as an additional insured  since the stents manufactured by it and sold by us are inserted in the body 
if we or our manufacturers fail to comply with regulatory laws and regulations  we or such manufacturers may be subject to enforcement actions  which could affect their ability to develop  market and sell products successfully 
this could harm our reputation and lead to less acceptance of such products by the market 
these enforcement actions may include product seizures  voluntary or mandatory recalls  voluntary or mandatory patient or physician notification  and restrictions on or prohibitions against marketing the products 
we face competition that may adversely impact us  which impact may be increased as a result of china s inclusion in the world trade organization 
we compete with other independent distributors of capital equipment in china 
given the rapid pace of technological advancement  particularly in the medical products field  other independent distributors may introduce products into our markets that compete directly with our sales 
in addition to other independent distributors  we face significant competition from direct distributors of established manufacturers 
in the medical products field  for example  we compete with certain major manufacturers that maintain their own direct sales forces in china 
in addition  to the extent that certain manufacturers market under one brand name a wide variety of products in china to different market sectors including non medical  those manufacturers may be better able than we are to establish brand name recognition across industry lines 
as a result of china becoming a member of the world trade organization  or wto  import restrictions on medical equipment are expected to be gradually reduced 
the wto also requires china to lower its import tariffs as a condition for membership 
reduced import restrictions and or lower tariffs may lead to increased imports of foreign medical equipment and therefore lead to increased competition in the domestic medical equipment markets 
similarly  reduced import restrictions and or lower tariffs on medical equipment may affect the competition in the end use markets of our customers and indirectly affect our sales to such customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with such manufacturers and distributors 
if we are not able to hire and retain qualified sales representatives and service specialists  then our marketing competitiveness  selling capabilities and related growth efforts will be impaired 
we believe that to be successful we must continue to hire  train and retain highly qualified sales representatives and service specialists 
our sales growth has depended on hiring and developing new sales representatives 
due to the relationships developed between our sales representatives and our customers  upon the departure of a sales representative we face the risk of losing the representative s customers  especially if the representative were to act as a representative of our competitors 
in addition  the imaging equipment market and other high technology medical equipment markets rely on the hiring and retention of skilled service specialists to maintain such equipment 
there may be a shortage of these skilled specialists  which may result in intense competition and increasing salaries 
any inability on our part to hire or retain such skilled specialists could limit our ability to expand into markets and then our marketing competitiveness  selling capabilities and related growth efforts will be impaired 
we must maintain a significant investment in inventory  which is costly and  if not properly managed  would result in an inability to provide timely marketing and delivery and could result in financial or operating imbalances and problems with liquidity and capital resources 
in order to provide prompt and complete service to our customers  we maintain a significant investment in healthcare product inventory 
although we closely monitor our inventory exposure through a variety of inventory control procedures and policies  there can be no assurance that such procedures and policies will continue to be effective or that unforeseen product development or price changes will not result in an inability to provide timely marketing and delivery and could result in financial or operating imbalances and problems with liquidity and capital resources 
if we do not maintain good relations with foreign trade corporations  our ability to import products may be adversely affected 
in the sale of our medical capital equipment into china  we must make most of our sales through foreign trade corporations  or ftcs 
although purchasing decisions are made by the end users  which may be individuals or groups having the required approvals from their administrative organizations and which are obligated to pay the applicable purchase prices  we enter into a formal purchase contract with only the ftcs 
the ftcs make purchases on behalf of the end users and are legally authorized by the chinese government to conduct import business 
these organizations are chartered and regulated by the government and are formed to facilitate foreign trade 
we market our products directly to end users  but in consummating sales we also must interact with the particular ftcs representing the end users 
by virtue of our direct contractual relationship with the ftc  rather than the end user  we are to some extent dependent upon the continuing existence of and contractual compliance by the ftcs until the particular transaction has been completed 
our dependence on sub distributors and dealers could be detrimental to our financial condition if those sub distributors or dealers do not sell our products 
in the sale of our medical capital equipment  medical consumables and low priced instrumentation  we plan to increase sales to independent sub distributors and dealers  who in turn sell to end users 
if the efforts of such sub distributors and dealers prove unsuccessful  if such sub distributors and dealers abandon or limit their sales of our products  or if such sub distributors and dealers encounter serious financial difficulties  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
sub distributors and dealers generally purchase from us to fill specific orders from their customers 
as a result  there can be no assurance that sub distributors and dealers will continue to purchase our products 
further  such sub distributors and dealers generally are not exclusive to us and are free to sell  and do sell  competing products 
risks relating to the healthcare services division our shanghai united family hospital only commenced operations in october and there can be no assurances that it will achieve profitability 
our shanghai united family hospital had its opening ceremony on october  after significant delays 
the facility did not immediately offer full services and phased in services since then  including initiating in patient services in january there can be no assurances that the facility will achieve or sustain profitability or that additional capital will be available to finance additional facilities  such as satellite clinics  which comprises our current healthcare services growth strategy 
if we do not attract and retain qualified physicians or other hospital personnel  our hospital operations would be adversely affected 
our success in operating our hospitals and clinics will be  in part  dependent upon the number and quality of physicians on the medical staffs of these hospitals and our ability to maintain good relations with our physicians 
as we offer international standard medicine at our hospitals and clinics  we are further dependent on attracting a limited number of qualified western medical professionals  not all of whom have long term relationships with china 
physicians may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time 
if we are unable to successfully maintain good relationships with physicians  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  the failure to recruit and retain qualified management  nurses and other medical support personnel  or to control labor costs  could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our business is heavily regulated and failure to comply with those regulations could result in penalties  loss of licensure  additional compliance costs or other adverse consequences 
healthcare providers in china  as in most other populous countries  are required to comply with many laws and regulations at the national and local government levels 
these laws and regulations relate to licensing  the conduct of operations  the relationships among hospitals and their affiliated providers  the ownership of facilities  the addition of facilities and services  confidentiality  maintenance and security issues associated with medical records  billing for services  and prices for services 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we could suffer penalties  including the loss of our licenses to operate 
in addition  further healthcare legislative reform is likely  and could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in the event we do not comply or if the cost of compliance is expensive 
the above list of certain regulated areas is not exhaustive and it is not possible to anticipate the exact nature of future healthcare legislative reform in china 
depending on the priorities determined by the chinese ministry of health  the political climate at any given time  the continued development of the chinese healthcare system and many other factors  future legislative reforms may be highly diverse  including stringent infection control policies  improved rural healthcare facilities  increased regulation of the distribution of pharmaceuticals and numerous other policy matters 
consequently  the implications of these future reforms could result in penalties  loss of licensure  additional compliance costs or other adverse consequences 
our operations could be adversely affected by the high cost of malpractice insurance 
in recent years  physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers in the us have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging malpractice or related legal theories 
many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs 
while similar lawsuits are not common in china  to protect us from the cost of any such claims  we generally maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe to be appropriate for our operations 
however  our insurance coverage may not cover all claims against us or continue to be available at a reasonable cost for us to maintain adequate levels of insurance 
we depend on information systems  which if not implemented and maintained could adversely affect our operations 
our healthcare services business is dependent on effective information systems that assist us in  among other things  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  supporting our healthcare management techniques  processing billing and providing data to regulators 
if we experience a reduction in the performance  reliability or availability of our information systems  our operations and ability to produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely impacted 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet operational needs 
moreover  the proposed expansion of facilities and similar activities require transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information systems 
we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities and currently are in the process of rolling out  for expected completion in the first quarter of fiscal  new clinical and financial reporting systems throughout our healthcare services operations  which rollout and other proposed system wide improvements in information systems are expected to require additional capital expenditures 
if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly implement  finance  maintain or expand our systems  we could suffer  among other things  from operational disruptions  which could adversely affect our prospects or results of operations 
our operations face competition that could adversely affect our results of operations 
our beijing and shanghai healthcare facilities compete with a large number and variety of health care facilities in their respective markets 
there are numerous chinese hospitals available to the general populace  as well as international clinics serving the expatriate business and diplomatic community 
although we believe that existing international clinics do not currently provide competitive  specialized international standard services in beijing  there can be no assurance that these or other clinics  hospitals or other facilities will not commence or expand such operations  which would increase their competitive edge 
further  there can be no assurance that a qualified western or other health care organization  having greater resources in the provision or management of health care services  will not decide to engage in operations similar to those to be conducted by us in beijing or shanghai 
risks relating to doing business in china substantially all of our assets are located in china  and substantially all of our revenue is derived from our operations in china 
accordingly  our business  financial condition and results of operations are subject  to a significant degree  to economic  political and legal developments in china 
the economic system of china differs from the economics of most developed countries in many respects  including government investment  the level of development  control of capital investment  control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources 
the economic policies of the chinese government and economic growth of china could adversely affect us 
since the late s  the chinese government has been reforming the chinese economic system from a planned economy to a market oriented economy 
in recent years  the chinese government has implemented economic reform measures emphasizing decentralization  utilization of market forces in the development of the chinese economy and a higher level of management autonomy 
these reforms have resulted in significant economic growth and social progress  but the growth has been uneven both geographically and among various sectors of the economy 
economic growth has also been accompanied by periods of high inflation 
the chinese government has implemented various policies from time to time to restrain the rate of such economic growth  control inflation and otherwise regulate economic expansion 
in addition  the chinese government has attempted to control inflation by controlling the prices of basic commodities 
although we believe that the economic reforms and macroeconomic policies and measures adopted by the chinese government will continue to have a positive effect on economic development in china  these policies and measures may  from time to time  be modified or reversed 
adverse changes in economic and social conditions in china  in the policies of the chinese government or in the laws and regulations in china  could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of china and on infrastructure investment in china 
these developments could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and business  by  for example  reducing the demand for our products and or services 
the chinese legal system is relatively new and may not provide protections to us or our investors 
the chinese legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes 
unlike common law systems  it is a system in which decided legal cases have little precedential value 
in  the chinese government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general  including corporate organization and governance  foreign investments  commerce  taxation and trade 
legislation over the past years has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investment in china 
however  these laws  regulations and legal requirements are relatively recent  and their interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties  which may limit the legal protections available to foreign investors 
the chinese government recently underwent substantial reforms after the meeting of the national people s congress in march the chinese government has reiterated its policy of furthering reforms in the socialist market economy 
no assurance can be given that these changes will not have an adverse effect on business conditions in china generally or on our business in particular 
the conversion of renminbi into foreign currency is regulated  which regulations could adversely affect us 
a significant portion of our revenues and operating expenses are denominated in renminbi 
our revenues in renminbi typically are converted into us dollars and transferred to the united states for payment of invoices and as subsidiary dividends 
the transmission of foreign currency out of china is subject to regulation by china s state administration for foreign exchange  or safe 
it is possible that safe could impose new or increase existing restrictions on such currency uses or otherwise impose exchange controls that adversely affect our practices 
adverse actions by safe also could affect our ability to obtain foreign currency through debt or equity financing  including by means of loans or capital contributions 
the sars outbreak or similar outbreak could further adversely affect our operations 
in march  several countries  including china  experienced an outbreak of a new and highly contagious form of atypical pneumonia now commonly known as severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars 
the severity of the outbreak in certain municipalities  such as beijing  and provinces  such as guangdong province  materially affected general commercial activity 
according to the world health organization  over  cases of sars and more than deaths had been reported in over countries as of june since the sars epidemic in china had conflicting impacts on our healthcare businesses  the extent of the adverse impact that any future sars outbreak could have on the chinese economy and on us cannot be predicted at this time 
any further sars outbreak could significantly disrupt our ability to adequately staff our facilities and may generally disrupt operations 
in particular  a large percentage of the expatriate community that uses our healthcare services left china during the height of the sars epidemic and could be expected to do so again under similar circumstances 
although no one is able to predict the future impact of sars  the chinese government and the chinese healthcare industry have taken measures to prepare in the event of another sars outbreak 
the chinese government has indicated that any future outbreak would be contained and not present the same magnitude of social and economic disruption as experienced in the first outbreak 
although cases of sars in china recently have been reported  no significant adverse impact has resulted from those cases 
nonetheless  any further outbreak could severely restrict the level of economic activity in affected areas  which could have a material adverse effect on us as previously experienced 
in addition  in the past decade the greater china region has experienced limited cases of avian influenza commonly known as bird flu in the human population 
while the risk of sustained human to human transmission is low  the possibility of new virus outbreaks and related adverse impact on our ability to conduct normal business operations cannot be discounted 
the chinese government could change its policies toward  or even nationalize  private enterprise  which could harm our operations 
over the past several years  the chinese government has pursued economic reform policies  including the encouragement of private economic activities and decentralization of economic regulation 
the chinese government may not continue to pursue these policies or may significantly alter them to our detriment from time to time without notice 
changes in policies by the chinese government resulting in changes in laws  regulations  their interpretation  or the imposition of confiscatory taxation  restrictions on currency conversion or imports and sources of supply could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises by the chinese government could result in the total loss of our investment in china 
although several tax reforms that may be favorable to us have materialized in  the chinese tax system is subject to substantial uncertainties in both interpretation and enforcement of the laws 
in the past  following the chinese government s program of privatizing many state owned enterprises  the chinese government attempted to augment its revenues through heightened tax collection efforts 
continued efforts by the chinese government to increase tax revenues could result in other decisions or interpretations of the tax laws by the taxing authorities that increase our future tax liabilities or deny us expected refunds 
risks related to our corporate structure control by insiders and their ownership of shares having disproportionate voting rights could have a depressive effect on the price of common stock  impede a change in control and impede management replacement 
certain of our present management stockholders own  shares of our class b common stock  which vote as a single class with the common stock on all matters except as otherwise required by law 
the class b common stock and the common stock are identical on a share for share basis  except that the holders of class b common stock have six votes per share on each matter considered by our stockholders 
as of march   the three management holders of our outstanding class b common stock represented approximately of our outstanding capital stock and were deemed to beneficially own capital stock representing approximately of total voting power and may be able to cause the election of all of our directors 
these management stockholders have sufficient voting power to determine  in general  the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval  including mergers  consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
the disproportionate vote afforded the class b common stock could serve to impede or prevent a change of control 
as a result  potential acquirers will be discouraged from seeking to acquire control through the purchase of common stock  which could have a depressive effect on the price of our securities 
in addition  the effective control by these management stockholders could have the effect of preventing or frustrating attempts to influence  replace or remove management 
our unissued preferred stock could be issued to impede a change in control 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of blank check preferred stock with such designations  rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors 
accordingly  the board of directors is empowered  without stockholder approval but subject to applicable government regulatory restrictions  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
in the event of issuance  the preferred stock could be utilized  under certain circumstances  as a method of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control 
although we have no present intention to issue any shares of our preferred stock  there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future
