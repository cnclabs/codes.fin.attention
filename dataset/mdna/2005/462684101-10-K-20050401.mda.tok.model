item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview iridex corporation is a leading worldwide provider of semiconductor based laser systems used to treat eye diseases in ophthalmology and skin conditions in dermatology aesthetics 
our products are sold in the united states predominantly through a direct sales force and internationally through independent distributors into countries 
total sales in   and were million  million  and million respectively 
our revenues arise primarily from the sale of our iris medical oculight systems  iq  varilite  diolite and apex systems  delivery devices  disposables and  to a lesser extent  revenues from service and support activities 
our current family of oculight systems includes the iris medical oculight symphony  oculight sl  oculight slx  oculight gl and oculight glx laser photocoagulation systems 
we also produce the millennium endolase module which is sold exclusively to bausch lomb and incorporated into their millennium microsurgical system 
we believe that future growth in laser unit sales will be derived from growth in sales of peripheral delivery devices  disposable endoprobes and service revenue  our new product introductions  replacement of old laser instruments and technology and from the adoption of new less invasive procedures mip  such as transpupillary thermotherapy 
sales to international distributors are made on open credit terms or letters of credit 
sales of our products internationally currently are denominated in united states dollars and  accordingly  are subject to risks associated with international monetary conditions and currency fluctuations 
in general  strengthening of the us dollar relative to a foreign currency increases the cost of our product to our customers 
other risks that international sales are subject to include shipping delays  generally longer receivable collection periods  changes in applicable regulatory policies  domestic and foreign tax policies  trade restrictions  duties and tariffs and economic and political instability 
future currency fluctuations or other factors discussed above may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
see factors that may affect future results we depend on international sales for a significant portion of our operating results 
cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of purchasing components and sub systems  assembling  packaging  shipping and testing components at our facility  and the direct labor and associated overhead 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  materials and research support provided to clinicians at medical institutions developing new applications which utilize our products 
research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs of personnel  sales commissions  travel expenses  advertising and promotional expenses  facilities  legal and accounting  insurance and other expenses which are not allocated to other departments

international dermatology sales remained constant at million for and gross profit 
gross profit was million in  million in and million in gross profit represented of sales in and of sales in and respectively 
the total increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue in was due primarily to a decrease in overhead spending and a increase related to product mix offset by a decrease of related to an inventory reserve for saleable  but aging and potentially excess inventory partially associated with the company s recent introduction of new products and a decrease of associated with average selling prices

gross profit was million in  million in and million in gross profit represented of sales in and and in in  a slight increase of in direct inventory costs was offset by the same level of decrease in overhead spending 
we intend to continue our efforts to reduce the cost of components and thereby mitigate the impact of price reductions on our gross profit 
we believe gross profit in dollars will increase as volumes increase and unit production costs will decrease as costs are engineered out of new products 
in addition  as we evaluate gross margins on each of our product lines  we may choose to place greater focus on product lines with better margins 
overall  however  gross margins as a percentage of sales will continue to fluctuate due to changes in the relative proportions of domestic and international sales  the product mix of sales  costs associated with future product introductions and a variety of other factors 
see factors that may affect future results our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million or in to million from million in the increase in  in absolute dollars  consisted of a million increase in project spending related mainly to spending on two products released in  the iq and varilite 
research and development expenses decreased by in to million from million in the decrease in  in absolute dollars  consisted of million in reduced personnel spending related to the reduction in force in june  million in decreased clinical spending and million in reduced occupancy spending associated with renegotiation of a lease  offset by million in increased project spending 
these expenses were of sales in  of sales in and of sales in the increase  as a percentage of net sales  from to was attributable to the increase in research and development expense relative to the increase in the level of sales 
the decrease in research and development expenses in  as a percentage of sales  was due to the decline in expenses in absolute dollars and an increase in the level of sales 
for fiscal  we expect research and development expense to increase slightly as a result of development spending for new products and product improvement initiatives 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expense increased by in to million from million in sales  general and administrative expense increased by in to million from million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was driven primarily by a one time million charge to establish a reserve for unpaid sales taxes and interest  million in associated sales tax consulting fees and a million increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the reserve for sales tax resulted from the completion of a comprehensive review of our sales tax practices 
historically we had been collecting and remitting sales tax in only those states where we believed we had nexus 
based on the independent review  we are now collecting and remitting sales tax from customers in additional states and are in the process on entering into voluntary settlement agreements with certain states 
the company chose not to retroactively collect this sales tax from our customers 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in was driven primarily by million in increased non commission related selling activities and million in 
table of contents administrative spending associated primarily with increased consulting and insurance costs 
these expenses were of sales in  of sales in and of sales in the increase  as a percentage of net sales  from to  was attributable to the increase in sales  general and administrative expense relative to the increase in the level of sales 
for we expect sales  general and administrative expense  in absolute dollars  to decrease 
although spending in connection with sarbanes oxley compliance initiatives will increase  overall spending for will decrease as it will not include the one time charge of million for sales tax 
interest income  other income expense  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest income 
interest income was   and  in  and  respectively 
this income was primarily from interest earned on available for sale securities 
interest income increased in over mainly as a result of higher average cash balances during income taxes 
in  our effective rate was a benefit of 
in and  our effective rate was a benefit of and  respectively 
the tax rate for was higher than the federal and state combined statutory rate of because of certain tax benefits associated with tax exempt interest on tax preferred securities and with tax credits for research and development activities 
the tax rates for and resulted primarily due to pretax income approaching breakeven and the level of tax credits for research and development activities relative to the loss for and liquidity and capital resources at january   our primary sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million and available for sale securities of million  for a total of million 
in addition  we have available million under our unsecured line of credit which bears interest at the bank s prime rate and expires in october as of january   no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility 
we expect to renew the line of credit in october assuming that terms continue to be acceptable 
we believe that  based on current estimates  our current cash  available for sale securities and the credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through the next twelve months 
net cash generated by operations in totaled million as compared with million generated by operations in and million by operations in in  sources of cash included an increase in net accrued expenses and accounts payable of million  depreciation of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million and a decrease in prepaid expense of million 
uses of cash in included a net increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in the deferred tax asset of million  a net loss of million and an increase in net inventory of million 
the increase in net accrued expenses related mainly to a reserve and associated consulting fees for sales tax totalling million  increased payroll accruals of million due to the timing of payroll and other increases in accrued royalties and accrued warranty which individually were less significant 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to mainly to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter of inventory increased in primarily because of inventory purchases associated with new product introductions

uses of cash in included decreases in accounts payable of million  increases in net accounts receivable of million and an increase in the deferred tax asset of million 
the decrease in inventory and accounts payable was due mainly to implementation of an inventory reduction program 
the increase in accrued expenses consisted mainly of million for income tax payable  million for an increase in accrued warranty and million for an accrued liability 
the decrease in prepaid expenses consisted primarily of million for tax receivable 
in  we used million in cash for investing activities 
we used million in cash for investing activities in in  we generated million of cash from investing activities 
net cash provided by or used in investing activities was primarily due to the purchase and proceeds of available for sale securities and the acquisition of fixed assets 
net cash provided by financing activities during  and was million  million and million  respectively  which consisted primarily of issuance of stock in connection with our employee stock programs 
in december  we instituted a stock repurchase program whereby up to  shares of our common stock may be repurchased in the open market 
we plan to utilize all of the reacquired shares for reissuance in connection with employee stock programs 
no shares of our common stock from the open market were purchased during  and as of january   we have repurchased  shares of common stock under this program 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  net sales and expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience  our knowledge of economic and market factors and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized upon receipt of a purchase order and product shipment provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured 
shipments are generally made with free on board fob shipping point terms  whereby title passes upon shipment from our dock 
any shipments with fob receiving point terms are recorded as revenue when the shipment arrives at the receiving point 
deferred revenue relating to warranty contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable warranty contract 
cost is recognized as incurred 
up front fees received in connection with product sales are deferred and recognized over the associated product shipments 

table of contents warranty the company accrues for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of products in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued 
the company s warranty policy is effective for shipped products which are considered defective or fail to meet the product specifications 
we analyze failure rates  replacement cost  design changes when evaluating the adequacy of our warranty reserve 
warranty costs are reflected in the income statement as a cost of revenues 
although we believe we have the ability to reasonably estimate warranty expenses  unforeseen changes in factors affecting the estimate for warranty could occur and such changes could cause a material change in our warranty accrual estimate 
such a change would be recorded in the period in which the change was identified 
sales returns allowance and allowance for doubtful accounts in the process of preparing financial statements we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  we must estimate future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
the provision for sales returns amounted to million in similarly our management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of january  inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include on hand inventory  sales demo inventory and service loaner inventory as well as associated inventory reserves 
cost of inventory is determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out fifo method 
adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value  if required  are made for estimated excess  obsolescence or impaired inventory and are charged to cost of goods sold 
factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  physical deterioration and quality issues 
revisions to these adjustments would be required if these factors differ from our estimates 
income taxes deferred assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
changes in estimate of future levels of taxable income or tax planning strategies could result in the need to provide or increase the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets which could materially impact earnings in the period of change

table of contents factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information contained in this form k  we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
we rely on continued market acceptance of our existing products and any decline in sales of our existing products would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we currently market visible and infrared light semiconductor based photocoagulator medical laser systems to the ophthalmic market 
we also market visible and infrared light semiconductor based photocoagulator medical laser systems to the dermatology market 
we believe that continued and increased sales  if any  of these medical laser systems is dependent upon a number of factors including the following product performance  features  ease of use  scalability and durability  recommendations and opinions by ophthalmologists  dermatologists  other clinicians  plastic surgeons and their associated opinion leaders  including study outcomes  price of our products and prices of competing products and technologies  availability of competing products  technologies and alternative treatments  willingness of ophthalmologists and dermatologists to convert to semiconductor based or infrared laser systems from alternative technologies  and level of reimbursement for treatments administered with our products 
in addition  we derive a meaningful portion of our revenues from the sale of delivery devices 
our ability to increase revenues from the sale of delivery devices will depend primarily upon the features  ease of use and prices of our products  including the relationship to prices of competing delivery devices 
the level of service revenues will depend on our quality of care  responsiveness and the willingness of our customers to request our services rather than purchase competing products or services 
any significant decline in market acceptance of our products or our revenues derived from the sales of laser consoles  delivery devices or services would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face strong competition in our markets and expect the level of competition to grow in the foreseeable future 
competition in the market for devices used for ophthalmic and dermatology treatment procedures is intense and is expected to increase 
our competitive position depends on a number of factors including product performance  characteristics and functionality  ease of use  scalability  durability and cost 
our principal laser competitors in ophthalmology are lumenis ltd  carl zeiss  inc  alcon  quantel  laserex and nidek  inc all of these companies currently offer a competitive semiconductor based laser system in ophthalmology 
also within ophthalmology pharmaceutical alternative treatments for amd such as visudyne novartis and macugen eyetech compete rigorously with traditional laser procedures 
our principal competitors in dermatology are palomar technologies  laserscope  candela corporation  lumenis ltd 
and cutera  inc some competitors have substantially greater financial  engineering  product development  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do 
some companies also have greater name recognition than we do and long standing customer relationships 
in addition to other companies that manufacture photocoagulators  we compete with pharmaceuticals  other technologies and other surgical techniques 
some medical companies  academic and research institutions  or others  may develop new technologies or therapies that are more effective in treating conditions targeted by us or are less expensive than our current or future products 
any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and new applications 
our future success is dependent upon  among other factors  our ability to develop  obtain regulatory approval or clearance of  manufacture and market new products 
in september and october we introduced two new laser products  the iq in ophthalmology and the varilite in dermatology 
in may  we introduced a new type of illuminating endoprobe 
in june we began shipment of two new products  a micron slit lamp adaptor and a gauge single use endoprobe 
in october  we announced the introduction of a number of new products  specifically the oculight symphony multi wavelength laser delivery system  an expanded endoprobe product line and a mm large spot slit lamp adapter 
we also announced the millennium endolase module in  which we manufacture to be included in bausch lomb s millennium microsurgical system 
successful commercialization of these and other new products and new applications will require that we effectively transfer production processes from research and development to manufacturing and effectively coordinate with our suppliers 
in addition  we must successfully sell and achieve market acceptance of new products and applications and enhanced versions of existing products 
the extent of  and rate at which  market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables  which include  among other things  price  safety  efficacy  reliability  marketing and sales efforts  the development of new applications for these products  the availability of third party reimbursement of procedures using our new products  the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns 
our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation  including approval or clearance by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  and foreign government agencies 
any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products or enhanced versions of existing products and achieve market acceptance of new products and new applications could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and would cause our net revenues to decline 
if we cannot increase our sales volumes  reduce our costs or introduce higher margin products to offset anticipated reductions in the average unit price of our products  our operating results may suffer 
we have experienced declines in the average unit price of our products and expect to continue to suffer from declines in the future 
the average unit price of our products may decrease in the future in response to changes in product mix  competitive pricing pressures  new product introductions by our competitors or other factors 
if we are unable to offset the anticipated decrease in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes or through new product introductions  our net revenues will decline 
in addition  to maintain our gross margins  we must continue to reduce the manufacturing cost of our products 
if we cannot maintain our gross margins  our business could be seriously harmed  particularly if the average selling price of our products decreases significantly without a corresponding increase in sales 
we depend on sales of our ophthalmology products for a significant portion of our operating results 
we derive  and expect to continue to derive  a large portion of our revenue and profits from sales of our ophthalmology products 
in  and sales of our ophthalmology products were million  million and million or  and  respectively  of total sales 
we anticipate that sales of our ophthalmology products will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future as we continue to introduce new ophthalmology products  such as the iq laser system 

table of contents we depend on international sales for a significant portion of our operating results 
we derive  and expect to continue to derive  a large portion of our revenue from international sales 
in  and  our international sales were million  million and million  or  and  respectively  of total sales 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future 
none of our international revenues and costs has been denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies makes our products more expensive and thus less competitive in foreign markets 
the factors stated above could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our international operations and sales are subject to a number of other risks including changes in government legislation or regulation or in private third party payers policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing our products may prohibit adequate reimbursement 
there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system  reduce the costs of healthcare and change medical reimbursement policies 
doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users of our products may decline to purchase our products to the extent there is uncertainty regarding reimbursement of medical procedures using our products and any healthcare reform measures 
further proposed legislation  regulation and policy changes affecting third party reimbursement are likely 
we are unable to predict what legislation or regulation  if any  relating to the health care industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future  or what effect such legislation or regulation may have on us 
however  denial of coverage and reimbursement of our products would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on our direct sales force and network of international distributors to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force and distributor relationships could harm our business 
our ability to sell our products and generate revenue depends upon our direct sales force within the united states and relationships with independent distributors outside the united states 
as of january  our direct sales force consisted of employees with additional open positions and we maintained relationships with independent distributors internationally selling our products into countries 
we generally grant our distributors exclusive territories for the sale of our products in specified countries 
the amount and timing of resources dedicated by our distributors to the sales of our products is not within our control 
our international sales are entirely dependent on the efforts of these third parties 
if any distributor breaches or fails to generate sales of our products  we may be forced to replace the distributor and our ability to sell our products into that exclusive sales territory would be adversely affected 
we do not have any long term employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force 
we may be unable to replace our direct sales force personnel with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications  which may limit our revenues and our ability to maintain market share 
the loss of the services of these key personnel would harm our business 
similarly  our distributorship agreements are generally terminable at will by either party and distributors may terminate their relationships with us  which would affect our international sales and results of operations 

table of contents we are dependent on the successful outcome of clinical trials of our products and new applications using our products 
our success will depend in part on the successful outcome of clinical trials of our products and new applications using our products 
clinical trials are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
we have supported several clinical trials  including  for example  the tttcnv clinical trial 
the tttcnv clinical trial is a physician initiated multi center  prospective  double masked  placebo controlled  randomized trial conducted at centers in the united states 
this is a clinical trial performed within the fda cleared indications of the oculight slx and is being conducted to determine whether ttt laser treatment using our oculight slx infrared laser system and large spot slit lamp adapter can reduce the risk of vision loss for patients with wet amd compared to a randomized control  which should reflect the natural history of the disease 
in june  we announced the publication of two additional clinical studies  which also support the effectiveness of ttt for the treatment of wet age related macular degeneration 
both studies were prospective  non randomized  non masked case series that were performed using our oculight slx laser and large spot size slit lamp adapter 
in october  we announced that the preliminary visual outcome data in the intent to treat evaluation showed that ttt  as applied in the tttcnv trial  did not result in a significant beneficial effect relative to sham and that further subgroup analysis would be conducted 
since that time  interim results of subgroup analysis have demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in a subgroup of patients with baseline visual acuity of or worse  of treated eyes improved vision by one or more lines compared with none of the eyes in the untreated control group 
furthermore  at months  there was a line benefit in preserving vision in this subgroup when compared to sham treated eyes 
any impact on laser sales related to these trial results may take a number of years 
if the future results of any clinical trial regarding our products fails to demonstrate improved outcomes of treatments using our products  our ability to generate revenues from new products or new applications using our products would be adversely affected 
we face manufacturing risks 
the manufacture of our infrared and visible light photocoagulators and the related delivery devices is a highly complex and precise process 
we assemble critical subassemblies and all of our final products at our facility in mountain view  california 
we may experience manufacturing difficulties  quality control issues or assembly constraints  particularly with regard to new products that we may introduce 
we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products  which may require that we qualify other manufacturers for our products 
furthermore  we may experience delays  disruptions  capacity constraints or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations and  as a result  product shipments to our customers could be delayed  which would negatively impact our net revenues 
if we fail to accurately forecast demand for our product and component requirements for the manufacture of our product  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays and may experience lost sales or significant inventory carrying costs 
we use quarterly and annual forecasts based primarily on our anticipated product orders to plan our manufacturing efforts and determine our requirements for components and materials 
it is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our product and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials 
lead times for components vary significantly and depend on numerous factors  including the specific supplier  the size of the order  contract terms and current market demand for such components 
if we overestimate the demand for our product  we may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
over the past several quarters  we have placed a high priority on our asset management efforts to  among other things  reduce overall inventory levels and increase our cash position 
if we underestimate demand for our product and  consequently  our component and materials requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing  delay delivery of our product to our customers and result in the loss of customer sales 
any of these occurrences would negatively impact our business and operating results 

table of contents we depend on sole source or limited source suppliers 
we rely on third parties to manufacture substantially all of the components used in our products  including optics  laser diodes and crystals 
we have some long term or volume purchase agreements with our suppliers and currently purchase components on a purchase order basis 
some of our suppliers and manufacturers are sole or limited sources 
in addition  some of these suppliers are relatively small private companies that may discontinue their operations at any time 
there are risks associated with the use of independent manufacturers  including the following shortages or limitations on the ability to obtain supplies of components in the quantities that we require  delays in delivery or failure of suppliers to deliver critical components on the dates we require  failure of suppliers to manufacture components to our specifications  and potentially reduced quality  and inability to obtain components at acceptable prices 
our business and operating results may suffer from the lack of alternative sources of supply for critical sole and limited source components 
the process of qualifying suppliers is complex  requires extensive testing with our products  and may be lengthy  particularly as new products are introduced 
new suppliers would have to be educated in our production processes 
in addition  the use of alternate components may require design alterations to our products and additional product testing under fda and relevant foreign regulatory agency guidelines  which may delay sales and increase product costs 
any failures by our vendors to adequately supply limited and sole source components may impair our ability to offer our existing products  delay the submission of new products for regulatory approval and market introduction  materially harm our business and financial condition and cause our stock price to decline 
establishing our own capabilities to manufacture these components would be expensive and could significantly decrease our profit margins 
we do not currently intend to manufacture any of these components 
our business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to obtain components in the quantity and quality desired and at the prices we have budgeted 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year 
our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors contributing to these fluctuations include the following general economic uncertainties and political concerns  the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products  product enhancements and new applications  changes in demand for our existing line of dermatology and ophthalmic products  the cost and availability of components and subassemblies  including the ability of our sole or limited source suppliers to deliver components at the times and prices that we have planned  our ability to maintain sales volumes at a level sufficient to cover fixed manufacturing and operating costs  fluctuations in our product mix between dermatology and ophthalmic products and foreign and domestic sales  the effect of regulatory approvals and changes in domestic and foreign regulatory requirements  introduction of new products  product enhancements and new applications by our competitors  entry of new competitors into our markets  pricing pressures and other competitive factors  our long and highly variable sales cycle  changes in the prices at which we can sell our products  changes in customers or potential customers budgets as a result of  among other things  reimbursement policies of government programs and private insurers for treatments that use our products  and increased product development costs 
in addition to these factors  our quarterly results have been  and are expected to continue to be  affected by seasonal factors 

table of contents our expense levels are based  in part  on expected future sales 
if sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  we may be unable to adjust operating expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall of sales  and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  we have historically made a significant portion of each quarter s product shipments near the end of the quarter 
if that pattern continues  any delays in shipment of products could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for such quarter 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons of our past operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any quarter or year as an indication of our future performance 
our operating results in future quarters and years may be below expectations  which would likely cause the price of our common stock to fall 
we depend on collaborative relationships to develop  introduce and market new products  product enhancements and new applications 
we depend on both clinical and commercial collaborative relationships 
we have entered into collaborative relationships with academic medical centers and physicians in connection with the research and development and clinical testing of our products 
commercially  we currently collaborate with bausch lomb to design and manufacture a solid state green wavelength nm laser photocoagulator module  called the millennium endolase module 
the millennium endolase module is designed to be a component of bausch lomb s ophthalmic surgical suite product offering and is not expected to be sold as a stand alone product 
sales of the millennium endolase module are dependent upon the actual order rate from and shipment rate to bausch lomb  which depends on the efforts of our partner and is beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our relationship with bausch lomb will result in further sales of our millennium endolase module 
we also collaborated with miravant medical technologies  a maker of photodynamic drugs  on a device that emits a laser beam to activate a photodynamic drug developed by miravant for the treatment of wet amd 
in january  miravant announced that the top line results of their phase iii clinical trial indicated that photrex the photodynamic drug developed  did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint in the study population 
as we could not be assured that photrex would be timely or successfully pursued through clinical trials by miravant  we charged to expense in the fourth quarter of  million of inventory related to the oculight  the laser used by miravant in the phase iii clinical trials 
miravant has since received an approvable letter from the fda for photrex with conditions for final marketing approval which includes a request for an additional confirmatory clinical trial 
we are the exclusive provider of the oculight activation laser used in this application 
successful commercialization of this product will depend  among other things  on the results of the confirmatory clinical trial  acceptance of this product and miravant s ability to successfully market and sell this therapy 
the failure of any current or future clinical or commercial collaboration relationships could have a material adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products or applications and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face risks associated with our collaborative relationships 
our collaborators may not pursue further development and commercialization of products resulting from collaborations with us or may not devote sufficient resources to the marketing and sale of such products 
our reliance on others for clinical development  manufacturing and distribution of our products may result in unforeseen problems 
further  our collaborative partners may develop or pursue alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others 
if a collaborator elects to terminate its agreement with us  our ability to develop  introduce  market and sell the product may be significantly impaired and we may be forced to discontinue altogether the product resulting from the collaboration 
we may not be able to negotiate alternative collaboration agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
the failure of any current or future collaboration efforts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products or applications and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we are subject to government regulation which may cause us to delay or withdraw the introduction of new products or new applications for our products 
the medical devices that we market and manufacture are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and by foreign and state governments 
under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the related regulations  the fda regulates the design  development  clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  sale  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
before a new device can be introduced into the market  the product must undergo rigorous testing and an extensive regulatory review process implemented by the fda under federal law 
unless otherwise exempt  a device manufacturer must obtain market clearance through either the k premarket notification process or the lengthier premarket approval application pma process 
depending upon the type  complexity and novelty of the device and the nature of the disease or disorder to be treated  the fda process can take several years  require extensive clinical testing and result in significant expenditures 
even if regulatory approval is obtained  later discovery of previously unknown safety issues may result in restrictions on the product  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
other countries also have extensive regulations regarding clinical trials and testing prior to new product introductions 
our failure to obtain government approvals or any delays in receipt of such approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the fda imposes additional regulations on manufacturers of approved medical devices 
we are required to comply with the applicable quality system regulations qsrs and our manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing periodic inspections by the fda and corresponding state agencies  including unannounced inspections  and must be licensed as part of the product approval process before being utilized for commercial manufacturing 
noncompliance with the applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  withdrawal of marketing approvals  and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device we manufacture or distribute 
any of these actions by the fda would materially and adversely affect our ability to continue operating our business and the results of our operations 
in addition  we are also subject to varying product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
as a result of our sales in europe  we are required to have all products ce marked  an international symbol affixed to all products demonstrating compliance with the european medical device directive and all applicable standards 
while currently all of our released products are ce marked  continued certification is based on the successful review of our quality system by our european registrar during their annual audit 
any loss of certification would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our products could be subject to recalls even after receiving fda approval or clearance 
a recall would harm our reputation and adversely affect our operating results 
the fda and similar governmental authorities in other countries in which we market and sell our products have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture 
a government mandated recall  or a voluntary recall by us  could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors or design defects  including defects in labeling 
a recall could divert management s attention  cause us to incur significant expenses  harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our future sales 
if we modify one of our fda approved or cleared devices  we may need to seek new approvals or clearances which  if not granted  would prevent us from selling our modified products 

table of contents any modifications to an fda approved or cleared device that would significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new k clearance or possibly a pma approval 
we may not be able to obtain additional k clearances or pma approvals for new products or for modifications to  or additional intended uses or indications for  our existing products in a timely fashion  or at all 
delays in obtaining future clearances would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner  which in turn would harm our revenue and future profitability 
we have made modifications to our devices and the labeling of our devices in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals 
if the fda disagrees and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications  we may be required to recall and stop marketing the modified devices  which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign or relabel our products 
we rely on patents and proprietary rights to protect our intellectual property and business 
our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary information 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
we file patent applications to protect technology  inventions and improvements that are significant to the development of our business 
we have been issued fifteen united states patents and five foreign patents on the technologies related to our products and processes 
we have approximately four pending patent applications in the united states and five foreign pending patent applications that have been filed 
our patent applications may not be approved 
any patents granted now or in the future may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and development by our competitors of competing products 
moreover  our competitors  many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use or sell our products either in the united states or in international markets 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how which we seek to protect  in part  through proprietary information agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
our proprietary information agreements with our employees and consultants contain industry standard provisions requiring such individuals to assign to us without additional consideration any inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by us  subject to customary exceptions 
proprietary information agreements with employees  consultants and others may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
also  our trade secrets may become known to or independently developed by competitors 
the laser and medical device industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
companies in the medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
numerous patents are held by others  including academic institutions and our competitors 
until recently patent applications were maintained in secrecy in the united states until the patents issued 
patent applications filed in the united states after november generally will be published eighteen months after the filing date 
however  since patent applications continue to be maintained in secrecy for at least some period of time  both within the united states and with regards to international patent applications  we cannot assure you that our technology does not infringe any patents or patent applications held by third parties 
we have  from time to time  been notified of  or have otherwise been made aware of  claims that we may be infringing upon patents or other proprietary intellectual property owned by others 
if it appears necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under such patents or proprietary intellectual property 
although patent holders commonly offer such licenses  licenses under such patents or intellectual property may not be offered or the terms of any offered licenses may not be reasonable 

table of contents any claims  with or without merit  and regardless of whether we are successful on the merits  would be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel  cause shipment delays or require us to develop noninfringing technology or to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding and failure to obtain necessary licenses or develop alternate technologies could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our operating results may be adversely affected by changes in third party coverage and reimbursement policies and any uncertainty regarding healthcare reform measures 
our ophthalmology products are typically purchased by doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users  which bill various third party payers  such as governmental programs and private insurance plans  for the health care services provided to their patients 
third party payers are increasingly scrutinizing and challenging the coverage of new products and the level of reimbursement for covered products 
doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users of our products may not obtain adequate reimbursement for use of our products from third party payers 
while we believe that the laser procedures using our products have generally been reimbursed  payers may deny coverage and reimbursement for our products if they determine that the device was not reasonable and necessary for the purpose used  was investigational or was not cost effective 
in addition  third party payers may not initiate coverage of new procedures using our products for a significant period 
in september  the center for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  advised that claims for reimbursement for certain age related macular degeneration  or amd  procedures which use our oculight slx laser system  could be submitted for reimbursement  with coverage and payment to be determined by the local medical carriers at their discretion 
to date five carriers representing states have written reimbursement coverage policies on transpupillary thermotherapy  or ttt 
the states reimbursing for ttt are alaska  arizona  california  colorado  hawaii  iowa  idaho  mississippi  north carolina  north dakota  nevada  oregon  pennsylvania  south dakota  tennessee  washington and wyoming 
domestic sales of the infrared laser systems may continue to be limited until more local medical carriers reimburse for performing such amd procedures or until cms advises that claims for these procedures may be submitted directly to cms at the national level 
changes in government legislation or regulation or in private third party payers policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing our products may prohibit adequate reimbursement 
there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system  reduce the costs of healthcare and change medical reimbursement policies 
doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users of our products may decline to purchase our products to the extent there is uncertainty regarding reimbursement of medical procedures using our products and any healthcare reform measures 
further proposed legislation  regulation and policy changes affecting third party reimbursement are likely 
we are unable to predict what legislation or regulation  if any  relating to the health care industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future  or what effect such legislation or regulation may have on us 
however  denial of coverage and reimbursement of our products would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if product liability claims are successfully asserted against us  we may incur substantial liabilities that may adversely affect our business or results of operations 
we may be subject to product liability claims from time to time 
our products are highly complex and some are used to treat extremely delicate eye tissue and skin conditions on and near a patient s face 
although we maintain product liability insurance with coverage limits of million per occurrence and an annual aggregate maximum of million  our coverage from our insurance policies may not be adequate 
product liability insurance is expensive 
we might not be able to obtain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to protect us  if at all 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents if we fail to manage growth effectively  our business could be disrupted which could harm our operating results 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience growth in our business 
we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments to enable our future growth through  among other things  new product development and clinical trials for new applications and products 
we must also be prepared to expand our work force and to train  motivate and manage additional employees as the need for additional personnel arises 
our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
any failure to effectively manage future growth could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our facilities were to experience catastrophic loss  our operations would be seriously harmed 
our facilities could be subject to catastrophic loss such as fire  flood or earthquake 
all of our research and development activities  manufacturing  our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in mountain view  california 
any such loss at any of our facilities could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue and result in large expense to repair and replace our facilities 
we may need additional capital  which may not be available  and our ability to grow may be limited as a result 
we believe that our existing cash balances  available for sale securities  credit facilities and cash flow expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements at least through the next months 
however  we may be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
the development and marketing of new products and associated support personnel requires a significant commitment of resources 
if cash from available sources is insufficient  we may need additional capital  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  fund potential acquisitions or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
any inability to raise additional capital when we require it would seriously harm our business 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including quarterly variations in our operating results  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or of significant clinical achievements  changes in market valuations of other similar companies in our industry and general market conditions 
we receive only limited attention by securities analysts and may experience an imbalance between supply and demand for our common stock resulting from low trading volumes 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme volatility in the last few years that has often been unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations could have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock regardless of our performance 
changes in accounting rules 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the securities and exchange commission  or the sec  and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 

table of contents changes in accounting rules for stock based compensation may adversely affect our operating results  our stock price and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace 
we have a history of using employee stock options and other stock based compensation to hire  motivate and retain our workforce 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  which will require us  starting in the second half of  to measure compensation costs for all stock based compensation including stock options and our employee stock purchase plan at fair value and to recognize these costs as expenses in our statements of operations 
the recognition of these expenses in our statements of operations will result in lower earnings per share  which could negatively impact our future stock price 
in addition  if we reduced or alter our use of stock based compensation to minimize the recognition of these expenses  our ability to recruit  motivate and retain employees may be impaired  which could put us at a competitive disadvantage in the employee marketplace 
compliance with internal controls evaluations and attestation requirements 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we will be required  beginning in fiscal  to perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and have our auditor publicly attest to such evaluation 
we have prepared an internal plan of action for compliance  which includes a timeline and scheduled activities  although as of the date of this filing we have not yet prepared the evaluation 
compliance with these requirements is expected to be expensive and time consuming 
if we fail to timely complete this evaluation  or if our registered independent public accounting firm cannot timely attest to our evaluation  we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls 
in addition  any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures we are exposed to market risks inherent in our operations  primarily related to interest rate risk and currency risk 
these risks arise from transactions and operations entered into in the normal course of business 
we do not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of our marketable securities or our debt instruments 
we have no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to interest rate risks on cash and cash equivalents  available for sale marketable securities and any future financing requirements 
interest rate risks related to marketable securities are managed by managing maturities in our marketable securities portfolio 
we have no long term debt as of january  the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the marketable securities maturities or interest reset dates do not extend beyond fiscal year and the interest rates are primarily fixed 
qualitative disclosures interest rate risk 
our primary interest rate risk exposures relate to the available for sale securities will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future operations 

table of contents we have the ability to hold at least a portion of the fixed income investments until maturity and therefore would not expect the operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our short and long term marketable securities portfolio 
management evaluates its financial position on an ongoing basis 
currency rate risk 
we do not hedge any balance sheet exposures against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
the exposure related to currency rate movements would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows
