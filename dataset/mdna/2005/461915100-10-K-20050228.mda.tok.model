item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
see certain factors that may affect future results herein 
overview we provide asset administration services for the financial services industry through our wholly owned subsidiary  investors bank trust company 
we provide core services and value added services to a variety of financial asset managers  including mutual fund complexes  investment advisors  family offices  banks and insurance companies 
core services include middle office outsourcing  global custody  multicurrency accounting and fund administration 
value added services include securities lending  foreign exchange  cash management  performance measurement  institutional transfer agency  investment advisory services  lines of credit and brokerage and transition management services 
we have offices located in the united states  ireland  canada  and the cayman islands with a vast global subcustodian network established to accommodate the international needs of our clients 
at december   we provided services for approximately trillion in net assets  including approximately billion in foreign net assets 
we grow our business by selling our services to new clients and by further penetrating our existing clients 
we believe that we service less than of the assets managed by our existing clients  and we have traditionally achieved significant success in growing client relationships 
our ability to service new clients and expand our relationships with existing clients depends on our provision of superior client service 
our growth is also affected by overall market conditions  the regulatory environment for us and our clients and the success of our clients in marketing their products 
we derive our asset servicing revenue from providing these core and value added services 
we derive our net interest income by investing the cash balances our clients leave on deposit with us 
since we price our service offerings on a bundled basis  our share of earnings from these investments is viewed as part of the total compensation that our clients pay us for servicing their assets 
in establishing a fee structure for a specific client  we analyze all expected revenue and expenses 
we believe net operating revenue net interest income plus noninterest income and net income are the most meaningful measures of our financial results 
as an asset administration services company  the amount of net operating revenue that we generate is impacted by overall market conditions  client activity and the prevailing interest rate environment 
over the course of the past two years  we have benefited from the appreciation of the market values of the assets we service for our clients 
a significant portion of our core services revenue is based upon the amount of assets under administration 
as market values of underlying assets fluctuate  so will our revenue 
we have managed this volatility by offering a tiered pricing structure for our asset based fees 
as asset values increase  the basis point fee is reduced for the incremental assets 
many of our value added services are transactional based  and we receive a fee for each transaction processed 
we have continued to experience net interest margin compression during due to lower spreads  primarily resulting from lower yielding investment securities  as a result of increased purchases of variable rate securities during in addition  we experienced prepayments of higher yielding fixed rate securities during we primarily reinvested the cash flows from the securities that prepaid in lower yielding variable rate securities 
our net interest margin compression was also due to prepayment penalties  related to the prepayment of high rate borrowings  and higher interest rates during the second half of  which caused an increase in average rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities in as compared to in  we settled a tax assessment with the commonwealth of massachusetts 
in march  a retroactive change in the commonwealth of massachusetts tax law disallowed a dividends received deduction taken by the bank on dividends it had received since from a wholly owned real estate investment trust 
during the second quarter of  we settled this disputed tax assessment with the massachusetts department of revenue  agreeing to pay approximately of the liability 
as a result of this change in tax law  we recorded an additional state tax expense of approximately million  net of federal income tax benefit  in we remain focused on our sales efforts  prudent expense management and increasing our operating efficiency 
these goals are complicated by the need to build infrastructure to support our rapid growth  by the need to maintain state of the art systems and by the need to retain and motivate our workforce 
in our and earnings releases  we reported non gaap operating income and non gaap operating earnings per share information that exclude the effect of the state tax assessment settlement discussed above 
we believe that non gaap operating earnings provide a more meaningful presentation of our results of operations because they do not include the one time tax charge which was unrelated to our core operations 
the following table presents a reconciliation between net income and earnings per share presented on the face of our statements of income and the non gaap measure of net operating income referenced in our earnings releases dollars in thousands  except per share data gaap earnings for the year ended december  income before taxes    provision for income taxes    net income    earnings per share basic diluted non gaap operating earnings for the year ended december  income before taxes    provision for income taxes    net income    earnings per share basic diluted provision for income taxes for the year ended december  excludes a million charge  net of federal income tax benefit  that resulted from a retroactive change in the commonwealth of massachusetts tax law enacted in the first quarter of and the company s subsequent settlement of the resulting tax assessment with the massachusetts department of revenue 
the effect of the exclusions is an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we have identified the following accounting policies that  as a result of the complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved  could result in significant changes to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions 
senior management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
derivative financial instruments hedge accounting requires that we measure the changes in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges as compared to changes in expected cash flows of the underlying hedged transactions for each reporting period 
this process involves the estimation of the expected future cash flows of hedged transactions 
interest rate swaps are valued using a nationally recognized swap valuation model 
the libor london interbank offered rate curve in this model serves as the basis for computing the market value of the swap portfolio 
if interest rates increase  the swaps would gain in value 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  there would be a corresponding decline in the market value of the swap portfolio 
the measurement of fair value is based upon market values  however  in the absence of quoted market values  measurement involves the use of valuation models 
the use of alternative valuation methodologies could have a significant effect on estimated fair value 
defined benefit pension assumptions each fiscal year  we must assess and select the discount rate  compensation increase percentage and average return on plan assets assumptions in order to project our benefit obligations under our defined benefit plans 
the discount rate is based on the weighted average yield on high quality fixed income investments that are expected to match the plan s projected cash flows 
the compensation increase percentage is based upon management s current and expected salary increases 
the average return on plan assets is based on the expected return on the plan s current investment portfolio  which can reflect the historical returns of the various asset classes 
for the fiscal year ended december   the discount rate  compensation increase and average return on plan assets were  and  respectively 
the discount rate was lower by compared to december  due to a decline in interest rates 
the compensation increase assumption at december  was slightly higher by than at december  and the rate of return on plan assets of has remained consistent with the prior year 
net periodic pension expense for was million and is expected to be approximately million in fiscal year at december   the discount rate assumption for our nonqualified  unfunded  supplemental retirement plan  which covers certain employees  was 
the compensation increase percentage assumption ranged from to at december   compared to at december  the net periodic expense for for the supplemental retirement plan was million and is expected to be approximately million in fiscal year the increase in the expected pension cost in is due to a lower discount rate  combined with changes in the participant mortality rates and an increase in the compensation increase percentage assumption 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas r requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements  with measurement based upon the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
the statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim reporting period that begins after june   and replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we currently use the intrinsic value method to measure compensation cost related to our share based transactions 
we will adopt sfas r in the third quarter of and are in the process of determining the methodology we will use and the impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we do not anticipate any material impact to our financial condition or results of operations as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
as originally issued  eitf issue no 
was to be effective for all annual or interim financial statements for periods beginning after june   however  a partial deferral was issued in september eitf issue no 
addresses the identification of other than temporarily impaired investments  and requires that an impairment charge be recognized for other than temporarily impaired investments for which there is neither the ability nor intent to hold either until maturity or until the market value of the investment recovers 
we continue to monitor the fasb s discussions regarding eitf issue no 
 and to assess the impact of its application on our financial condition and results of operations 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by us  statements made by our employees  or information included in our filings with the securities and exchange commission including this form k may contain statements which are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements  which are made under section e of the securities exchange act of and which involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and are identified by words such as may  will  could  should  expect  plan  intend  seek  anticipate  believe  estimate  potential  or continue or other comparable terms or the negative of those terms 
forward looking statements in this form k include certain statements regarding liquidity  annual dividend payments  interest rate conditions  interest rate sensitivity  loss exposure on lines of credit  the timing and effect on earnings of derivative gains and losses  securities lending revenue  net interest income  operating expenses  compensation expense  pension plan and supplemental pension expense  depreciation expense  effective tax rate  the effect on earnings of changes in equity values and the effect of certain legal claims against us 
our actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
each of these factors  and others  are discussed from time to time in our filings with the sec 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates and the securities markets 
a significant portion of our fees is based on the market value of the assets we process 
accordingly  our operating results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates and securities markets as these fluctuations affect the market value of assets processed 
current market conditions  including the recent volatility in the equity markets  can have a material effect on our asset based fees 
while reductions in asset servicing fees may be offset by increases in other sources of revenue  a sustained downward movement of the broad equity markets will likely have an adverse impact on our earnings 
fluctuations in interest rates or the securities markets can also lead to investors seeking alternatives to the investment offerings of our clients  which could result in a lesser amount of assets processed and correspondingly lower fees 
also  our net interest income is earned by investing depositors funds in our investment portfolio and  in small part  by making loans 
changes in interest rates and or the relationship between short term and long term interest rates could adversely affect the market value of  or the earnings produced by  our investment and loan portfolios  and thus could adversely affect our operating results 
a material portion of our revenue is derived from our relationship with barclays global investors  na bgi and related entities 
as a result of our selection to service assets for barclays global investors canada  ltd  our assumption of the operations of the us asset administration unit of bgi in and our ongoing relationship with bgi s ishares and master investment portfolios  bgi accounted for approximately of our net operating revenue during the year ended december  we expect that bgi will continue to account for a significant portion of our net operating revenue 
while we provide services to bgi under long term contracts  those contracts may be terminated for certain regulatory and fiduciary reasons 
the loss of bgi s business would cause our net operating revenue to decline significantly and may have an adverse effect on our quarterly and annual results 
we may incur losses due to operational errors 
the services that we provide require complex processes and interaction with numerous third parties 
while we maintain sophisticated computer systems and a comprehensive system of internal controls  and our operational history has been excellent  from time to time we may make operational errors for which we are responsible to our clients 
in addition  even though we maintain appropriate errors and omissions and other insurance policies  an operational error could result in a significant liability to us and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we face significant competition from other financial services companies  which could negatively affect our operating results 
we are part of an extremely competitive asset servicing industry 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
these greater resources could  for example  allow our competitors to develop technology superior to our own 
in addition  we face the risk that large mutual fund complexes may build in house asset servicing capabilities and no longer outsource these services to us 
as a result  we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors  which could result in a loss of existing clients or difficulty in gaining new clients 
we may incur significant costs defending legal claims 
we have been named in a lawsuit in massachusetts state court alleging  among other things  violations of a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in a contract 
while we believe this claim is without merit  we cannot be sure that we will prevail in the defense of this claim 
we are also party to other litigation and we may become subject to other legal claims in the future 
litigation is costly and could divert the attention of management 
our future results depend  in part  on successful integration of pending and possible future acquisitions and outsourcing transactions 
integration of acquisitions and outsourcing transactions is complicated and frequently presents unforeseen difficulties and expenses which can affect whether and when a particular acquisition or outsourcing transaction will be accretive to our earnings per share 
any future acquisitions or outsourcing transactions will present similar challenges 
these acquisitions or outsourcing transactions can also consume a significant amount of management s time 
the failure to properly manage our growth could adversely affect the quality of our services and result in the loss of clients 
we have been experiencing a period of rapid growth that has required the dedication of significant management and other resources 
continued rapid growth could place a strain on our management and other resources 
to manage future growth effectively  we must continue to invest in our operational  financial and other internal systems  and our human resources 
we must hire and retain skilled personnel in order to succeed 
qualified personnel  in particular managers and other senior personnel  are in great demand throughout the financial services industry  especially if the recent economic recovery proves sustainable 
we could find it increasingly difficult to continue to attract and retain sufficient numbers of these highly skilled employees  which could affect our ability to attract and retain clients 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary technology 
our proprietary technology is important to our business 
we rely on trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary technology  all of which offer only limited protection 
these intellectual property rights may be invalidated or our competitors may develop similar technology independently 
legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights may be unsuccessful  and could also be expensive and divert management s attention 
our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate 
our quarterly and annual operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and annually for several reasons  including the timing of commencement or termination of client engagements  the rate of net inflows and outflows of investor funds in the investment vehicles offered by our clients  and changes in interest rates and equity values 
most of our expenses  such as employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed 
as a result  any shortfall in revenue relative to our expectations could significantly affect our operating results 
we are subject to extensive federal and state regulations that impose complex restraints on our business 
federal and state laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions and their parent companies apply to us 
our primary regulators are the federal reserve board frb  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  the massachusetts commissioner of banks and the national association of securities dealers  inc nasd 
virtually all aspects of our operations are subject to specific requirements or restrictions and general regulatory oversight including the following the frb and the fdic maintain capital requirements that we must meet 
failure to meet those requirements could lead to severe regulatory action or even receivership 
we are currently considered to be well capitalized  under massachusetts law  the bank may be restricted in its ability to pay dividends to investors financial  which may in turn restrict our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders  the frb and the fdic are empowered to assess monetary penalties against  and to order termination of activities by  companies or individuals who violate the law  and the nasd maintains certain regulatory requirements that our securities broker affiliate  investors securities services  inc  must meet 
failure to meet those requirements could lead to severe regulatory action 
banking law restricts our ability to own the stock of certain companies and also makes it more difficult for us to be acquired 
statements of income comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and net income for the year ended december  was million  up from million for the same period in the principal factors contributing to our net income growth were growth in asset servicing fees of in addition to a increase in net interest income 
net income growth was partially offset by a increase in operating expenses  largely due to new business  additional headcount and technology requirements 
our income statement for the year ended december  reflects the net effect of the first quarter tax accrual and its later partial reversal resulting from our settlement with the massachusetts department of revenue 
absent the effects of this tax matter  net income for the year ended december  increased from net operating income for the same period in fees and other revenue the components of fees and other revenue are as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change total asset servicing fees   other operating income   gain on sale of investment total fees and other revenue   the largest components of asset servicing fees are custody  accounting and administration  which increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in custody  accounting and administration fees are based in part on the value of assets processed 
assets processed is the total dollar value of financial assets on the reported date for which we provide one or more of the following services middle office outsourcing  global custody  multicurrency accounting  fund administration  securities lending  foreign exchange  cash management  performance measurement  institutional transfer agency  investment advisory services  lines of credit and brokerage and transition management services 
the change in net assets processed includes the following components dollars in billions for the year ended december  net assets processed  beginning of period  change in net assets processed sales to new clients further penetration of existing clients lost clients fund flows and market gain total change in net assets processed net assets processed  end of period  the majority of the increase in assets processed was due to sales to new and existing clients  the ability of our clients to develop and sell product  which generates fund flows that have a direct  positive impact on our business  and higher asset values compared to a year ago 
as indicated in the overview section  our core services fees are generated by charging a fee based upon the value of assets processed 
as market values or clients asset levels fluctuate  so will our revenue 
our tiered pricing structure  coupled with minimum and flat fees  allow us to manage this volatility to a certain extent 
as asset values increase  the basis point fee typically lowers 
when asset values decrease  revenue is only impacted by the asset decline at the then marginal rate 
if the value of equity assets held by our clients were to increase or decrease by  we estimate currently that this  by itself  would cause a corresponding change of approximately in our earnings per share 
if the value of fixed income assets held by our clients were to increase or decrease by  we estimate currently that this  by itself  would cause a corresponding change of approximately in our earnings per share 
in practice  earnings per share do not track precisely to the value of the equity and fixed income markets because conditions present in a market increase or decrease may generate offsetting increases or decreases in other revenue items 
for example  market volatility often results in increased transaction fee revenue 
also  market declines may result in increased interest income and sweep fee income as clients move larger amounts of assets into the cash management vehicles that we offer 
however  there can be no assurance that these offsetting revenue increases will occur during any future downturn in the equity or fixed income markets 
transaction driven income includes our ancillary services  such as foreign exchange  cash management and securities lending 
foreign exchange fees were million for the year ended december   up from the same period in the increase in foreign exchange fees is attributable to new clients  increased activity in international markets and volatility in currency markets 
future foreign exchange income is dependent on the level of client activity and the overall volatility in the currencies traded 
cash management fees  which consist of sweep fees  were million for the year ended december   up from the same period in the increase is the result of higher domestic and foreign cash balances held by our clients 
cash management revenue will continue to depend on the level of client balances maintained in our cash management products 
investment advisory fees were million for the year ended december   up from the same period in the increase in investment advisory fees is attributable to increased average asset values of the merrimac master portfolio  an investment company for which we act as advisor  and where a portion of excess client cash balances are invested 
future investment advisory fees are dependent upon the asset levels within the merrimac master portfolio  which are driven by overall market conditions  client activity and transaction volumes 
securities lending fees were million for the year ended december   up from the same period in  primarily due to improved spreads and volumes 
securities lending transaction volume is positively affected by the market value of the securities on loan  merger and acquisition activity  increased ipo activity and a steeper short end of the yield curve 
if the capital markets continue to experience the aforementioned activity  it is likely that our securities lending revenue will continue to be positively impacted 
if we experience a reduction in our securities lending portfolio  lower market values or compression of the spreads earned on our securities lending activity  our securities lending revenue will likely be negatively impacted 
net interest income the following table presents the components of net interest income dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change interest income   interest expense   total net interest income   net interest income is affected by the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  and the movement and level of interest rates 
the improvement in our net interest income was primarily due to balance sheet growth  driven by healthy client funding  partially offset by lower investment spreads 
during we continued to employ a strategy of prepaying high rate borrowings and replacing them with lower cost term funding in order to maintain our net interest margin 
prepayment fees were incurred during the first half of and were million  compared to million during this strategy combined with a rising interest rate environment during the second half of resulted in a basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the majority of our funding sources are priced based on the federal funds rate 
the table below presents the changes in net interest income resulting from changes in the volume of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities and changes in interest rates for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  changes attributed to both volume and rate have been allocated based on the proportion of change in each category dollars in thousands for the year ended december  vs 
december  change due to volume change due to rate net interest earning assets fed funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements investment securities    loans   total interest earning assets    interest bearing liabilities deposits    borrowings    total interest bearing liabilities    change in net interest income    in addition to investing in both variable and fixed rate securities  we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risks 
see the market risk section for more detailed information 
operating expenses total operating expenses were million in  up from the growth in our cost structure was largely driven by the new business that we won during  which required us to invest in headcount and technology 
it is expected that only incremental expense associated with new business will be added during the components of operating expenses were as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change compensation and benefits   technology and telecommunications   transaction processing services   depreciation and amortization   occupancy   professional fees   travel and sales promotion   insurance   other operating expenses   total operating expenses   compensation and benefits increased million  or  from salaries increased due to higher headcount and annual merit raises by approximately million and million  respectively  from to in addition  incentive payments that are directly tied to our earnings per share outperformance increased approximately million from to these increases were partially offset by employee costs that shifted to technology and telecommunications expense as part of our outsourcing arrangement with ibm that was entered into in the summer of further increases in compensation expense in will be primarily driven by new business wins  annual merit increases and stock option expenses 
technology and telecommunications expense increased million  or  from as a result of increased infrastructure investments in as mentioned in the item i 
business section  we entered into an agreement with ibm in the summer of to outsource certain technical infrastructure services 
service expense under this agreement was million during  which included initial start up costs 
the costs of these services are offset by decreases in other technology and telecommunications expenses  as the services were previously performed internally or by other service providers 
future technology and telecommunications expense will be dependent upon the amount of new business we win  client integrations and ongoing improvement to our infrastructure 
generally  we expect technology investment to equal approximately of net operating revenue 
transaction processing services expense increased from as a result of higher global asset values and transactions with our subcustodians 
future transaction processing servicing expense will be dependent on asset levels and the volume of client transaction activity 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from this increase resulted from the completion of capitalized software projects in late and early and their placement into service 
this increase was partially offset by fully depreciated equipment from our assumption of bgi s north american asset administration unit 
we will continue to invest in  and place into service  technology projects in professional fees expense increased from  primarily due to increased fees associated with the merrimac master portfolio 
the merrimac fees are asset based and have grown along with the assets of the portfolios 
also in  we incurred additional technical consulting fees as we hired external consultants to work on certain technology initiatives 
future professional fees are dependent upon changes in the value of the merrimac portfolios and upon other business needs for outside professional services 
travel and sales promotion expense increased from travel and sales promotion expense consists of expenses incurred by the sales force  client management staff and other employees in connection with sales calls with potential clients and traveling to existing client sites  our offices in new york and california and our foreign subsidiaries 
all of these activities may increase in  dependent upon new business leads and other client and business needs 
insurance expense was up from in may  our five year fixed rate insurance policy expired  resulting in increased premiums 
our insurance policies are renewed annually and we expect insurance expense in to continue at approximately the same level as in other operating expense increased from the primary contributors to the increase include higher regulatory assessments due to higher deposit liabilities  higher recruiting expense due to increased staffing needs  increased advertising expense and increased miscellaneous office expense due to the overall growth of our business 
we expect other operating expense to increase in due to new business wins 
income taxes income taxes were million for the year ended december   up from the same period in this is attributable to a increase in pretax earnings for the year ended december  from the same period in in  we expect that our effective tax rate will approximate to of pretax income 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and net income for the year ended december  was million  up from million for the same period in this increase was the result of growth in net interest income caused by a decline in our cost of funds due to lower interest rates 
the increase was also due to growth in fees and other revenue caused by increased net assets processed related to sales to new and existing clients  fund flows  market appreciation during  and increased client transaction activity 
net income growth was partially offset by a increase in operating expenses and by the additional tax expense incurred as a result of our settlement of a tax assessment by the commonwealth of massachusetts 
fees and other revenue the components of fees and other revenue are as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change total asset servicing fees   other operating income   total fees and other revenue   the largest components of asset servicing fees are custody  accounting and administration  which increased to million 
these fees are based in part on the total dollar value of financial assets on the reported date for which we provide one or more of the following services middle office outsourcing  global custody  multicurrency accounting  fund administration  securities lending  foreign exchange  cash management  performance measurement  institutional transfer agency  investment advisory services  lines of credit and brokerage and transition management services

transaction driven income includes our ancillary services  such as foreign exchange  cash management and securities lending 
the increase in foreign exchange fees from is attributable to further penetration of existing clients  the addition of new clients  higher transaction volumes and volatility within the currencies traded by our clients 
the increase in cash management fees from is primarily due to increased client balances 
securities lending fees were down from primarily due to narrower spreads 
net interest income the following table presents the components of net interest income dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change interest income   interest expense   total net interest income   the improvement in our net interest income was primarily driven by declining rates on our liabilities 
although the average funding balance increased billion in  the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities declined more rapidly than the volume increase 
also during  we experienced higher volumes of prepayments from our investment portfolio 
the cash flows from these prepayments were reinvested in lower yielding interest earning assets 
the table below presents the changes in net interest income resulting from changes in the volume of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities and changes in interest rates for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  changes attributed to both volume and rate have been allocated based on the proportion of change in each category dollars in thousands for the year ended december  vs

compensation and benefits expense decreased from due to a reduction in our average number of employees during as a result of efficiencies gained through technology enhancements 
technology and telecommunications expense decreased from significant technology and telecommunications expense was incurred in related to the integration of the bgi us asset administration unit into our technology infrastructure which was completed in january transaction processing services expense decreased from during  we were in the process of converting the assets of the assumed bgi us asset administration unit to our subcustodian network which resulted in significant transaction processing expenses during the conversion period 
this conversion was completed during absent the expenses associated with the conversion  transaction processing fees increased on an overall basis due to increased volumes of client activity 
occupancy expense increased from this increase was primarily due to increased space in our boston and dublin offices to accommodate growth resulting from new client business 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from as a result of the completion of capitalized software projects in late and and their placement into service along with additional leasehold improvements as a result of the new space we occupied in boston and dublin 
income taxes income taxes were million for the year ended december   up from the same period in the factors that contributed to the significant increase in included a settlement of our tax assessment with the commonwealth of massachusetts department of revenue and increased pretax earnings

the following table summarizes our investment portfolio as of the dates indicated dollars in thousands december  securities held to maturity mortgage backed securities    federal agency securities    state and political subdivisions    total securities held to maturity    securities available for sale mortgage backed securities    state and political subdivisions    corporate debt    us treasury securities   federal agency securities   foreign government securities   total securities available for sale   the overall increases in our held to maturity and available for sale portfolios are attributable to investing client deposits and borrowed funds to effectively utilize the bank s capital and accommodate client fund flows 
the billion  or  increase in our held to maturity portfolio from to is due to investment security purchases that we expect  as we continue to grow our balance sheet  will protect our net interest margin  while maintaining an acceptable risk profile 
the investment security purchases primarily included floating rate mortgage backed and small business administration sba securities  which offer an attractive yield and reprice as interest rates increase 
our held to maturity portfolio securities are purchased with an intent and ability to hold to maturity 
the held to maturity investment portfolio is not viewed as our primary source of funds to satisfy liquidity needs 
the billion  or  increase in our available for sale portfolio from to is due to purchases of mortgage backed securities  which allow us to diversify our portfolio with assets that reprice more frequently 
in addition  we believe that we are able to take advantage of attractive yield and limited extension risk which aligns with our asset and liability strategy 
refer to the gap analysis under the market risk section for additional details regarding the matching of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the average balance of our combined investment portfolios for the year ended december  was billion  with an average yield of  compared to an average balance of billion with an average yield of during the decline in yield is primarily due to an increase in the level of variable rate securities in our investment portfolio during and prepayments of higher yielding fixed rate securities 
during the second half of interest rates began to increase  resulting in lower prepayments 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized net amortization of million and million  respectively 
if interest rates rise during  we would expect slower prepayments and our overall yield to increase as our variable rate securities reprice 
conversely  if interest rates were to decline in  we would expect that prepayments would accelerate  with the cash flows from these prepayments being reinvested in lower yielding assets of equal quality and risk 
we invest in mortgage backed securities and federal agency securities to increase the total return of the investment portfolio 
mortgage backed securities generally have a higher yield than us treasury securities due to credit and prepayment risk 
credit risk results from the possibility that a loss may occur if a counterparty is unable to meet the terms of the contract 
prepayment risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates may cause mortgage backed securities to be paid off prior to their maturity dates 
federal agency bonds generally have a higher yield than us treasury securities due to credit and prepayment risk 
credit risk results from the possibility that the federal agency issuing the securities may be unable to meet the terms of the security 
credit risk related to mortgage backed securities and federal agency bonds is substantially reduced by payment guarantees and credit enhancements 
we invest in municipal securities to generate stable  tax advantaged income 
municipal securities generally have lower stated yields than federal agency and us treasury securities  but their after tax yields are comparable 
municipal securities are subject to call risk 
however  all municipal securities that we invest in are insured and aaa rated 
call risk is similar to prepayment risk and results from the possibility that fluctuating interest rates and other factors may result in the exercise of the call option by the issuing municipality prior to the maturity date of the bond 
the carrying value  weighted average yield  and contractual maturity of our securities held to maturity at december  are reflected in the following table dollars in thousands years under to to over amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield mortgage backed securities   federal agency securities   state and political subdivisions   total securities held to maturity   the carrying value  weighted average yield  and contractual maturity of our securities available for sale at december  are reflected in the following table dollars in thousands years under to to over amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield mortgage backed securities  state and political subdivisions   corporate debt  us treasury securities   foreign government  total securities available for sale   actual maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties 
loan portfolio our loan portfolio decreased million  or  from to primarily due to a decline in client overdrafts and line of credit advances 
the following table summarizes our loan portfolio for the dates indicated dollars in thousands december  loans to mutual funds     loans to individuals      loans to others      less allowance for loan losses net loans      floating rate      fixed rate we make loans to individually managed account customers and to mutual funds and other pooled product clients 
we offer overdraft protection and lines of credit to our clients for the purpose of funding redemptions  covering overnight cash shortfalls  leveraging portfolios and meeting other client borrowing needs 
virtually all loans to individually managed account customers are written on a demand basis  bear variable interest rates tied to the prime rate or the federal funds rate and are fully secured by liquid collateral  primarily freely tradable securities held in custody by us for the borrower 
we monitor the value of collateral daily to ensure the amount of collateral held by us exceeds the loan balance by a certain threshold 
loans to mutual funds and other pooled product clients include unsecured lines of credit that may  in the event of default  be collateralized at our option by securities held in custody by us for those clients 
loans to individually managed account customers  mutual funds and other pooled product clients also include advances that we make to certain clients pursuant to the terms of our custody agreements with those clients to facilitate securities transactions and redemptions 
at december   our only lending concentrations that exceeded of total loan balances were the lines of credit to mutual fund clients discussed above 
these loans were made in the ordinary course of business on the same terms and conditions prevailing at the time for comparable transactions 
our credit loss experience has been excellent 
there have been no loan charge offs in the last five years  or in the history of our company 
it is our policy to place a loan on nonaccrual status when either principal or interest becomes days past due and the loan s collateral is not sufficient to cover both principal and accrued interest 
as of december   there were no loans on nonaccrual status  no loans greater than days past due  and no troubled debt restructurings 
although virtually all of our loans are fully collateralized with freely tradable securities  management recognizes some credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio  and has an allowance for loan losses of million at december   a level which has remained consistent for the past five years 
this amount is not allocated to any particular loan  but is intended to absorb any risk of loss inherent in the loan portfolio 
management actively monitors the loan portfolio and the underlying collateral and regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
deposits total deposits were billion at december   up from december  the increase in our deposit balances is a direct result of the growth in assets processed from our custody business 
we effectively utilized these cash balances to fund a significant portion of our asset growth 
the following table represents the average balance and weighted average yield paid on deposits dollars in thousands december  december  average balance weighted average yield average balance weighted average yield interest bearing savings   time deposits   noninterest bearing demand deposits   savings   time deposits   repurchase agreements and short term and other borrowings asset growth was funded in part by increased securities sold under repurchase agreements 
repurchase agreements increased billion  or  from to the majority of our repurchase agreements are with clients who prefer a more collateralized form of deposit 
repurchase agreements provide for the sale of securities for cash coupled with the obligation to repurchase those securities on a set date or on demand 
we use repurchase agreements  including client repurchase agreements  because they provide a lower cost source of funding than other short term borrowings and allow our clients the extra benefit of collateralization of their deposits 
the average balance of securities sold under repurchase agreements for the year ended december  was billion with an average cost of approximately  compared to an average balance of billion and an average cost of approximately for the same period last year 
the rate increase is due to a higher interest rate environment during the last half of and to a prepayment fee of million incurred in there were no prepayment fees for the year ended december  short term and other borrowings decreased billion  or  from to we use short term and other borrowings to offset variability of deposit flow 
the average balance of short term and other borrowings for the year ended december  was billion with an average cost of approximately  compared to an average balance of billion and an average cost of approximately for the same period last year 
the average cost of borrowing for the years ended december  and included prepayment fees of million and million  respectively 
these fees were incurred to employ an asset and liability strategy in which we replaced high cost borrowings with new borrowings at lower rates 
market risk our clients  in the course of their financial asset management  maintain cash balances  which they can deposit with us on a short term basis in interest bearing accounts or client repurchase agreements 
we either directly invest these cash balances to earn interest income  or place these deposits in third party vehicles and remit a portion of the earnings on these investments to our clients after deducting a fee as our compensation for investing clients funds in these investment vehicles 
in the conduct of these activities  we are subject to market risk 
market risk is the risk of an adverse financial impact from changes in market prices and interest rates 
the level of risk we assume is a function of our overall strategic objectives and liquidity needs  client requirements and market volatility 
the active management of market risk is integral to our operations 
the objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to provide sustainable net interest income under various economic conditions 
our board of directors has set asset and liability management policies that define the overall framework for managing interest rate sensitivity  including accountabilities and controls over investment activities 
these policies delineate investment limits and strategies that are appropriate  given our liquidity and regulatory requirements 
for example  we have established a policy limit stating that projected net interest income over the next twelve months will not change by more than given a change in interest rates of up to basis points or over twelve months 
each quarter  our board of directors reviews our asset and liability positions  including simulations of the effect of various interest rate scenarios on our capital 
the day to day responsibility for oversight of the asset and liability management function has been delegated by our board of directors to our asset and liability committee alco 
alco is a senior management committee consisting of the chief executive officer  the president  the chief financial officer  the chief risk officer and members of the treasury function 
alco meets twice monthly 
our primary tool in managing interest rate sensitivity is an income simulation model 
key assumptions in the simulation model include the timing of cash flows  maturities and repricing of financial instruments  changes in market conditions  capital planning and deposit sensitivity 
the model assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period will change periodically over the period being measured 
the model also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and as a result  the model cannot precisely predict the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income 
actual results may differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the results of the income simulation model as of december  and indicated that an upward shift of interest rates by basis points over a twelve month period would result in a reduction in projected net interest income of and  respectively  which is within our policy limit 
we also simulate a basis point rate reduction over a twelve month period  however  in the simulation we do not reduce rates below because of the low likelihood that rates will decrease to below 
this modified simulation would also result in a reduction in projected net interest income of and at december  and  respectively 
in  the company s board of directors approved a temporary exception to the limit for decreases in interest rates  as a basis point reduction would have moved interest rates into a negative position 
we also use gap analysis as a secondary tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity 
gap analysis involves measurement of the difference in asset and liability repricing on a cumulative basis within a specified time frame 
a positive gap indicates that more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities mature in a time frame  and a negative gap indicates the opposite 
by seeking to minimize the net amount of assets and liabilities that could reprice in the same time frame  we attempt to reduce the risk of significant adverse effects on net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
as shown in the cumulative gap position in the table presented below  at december   interest bearing liabilities repriced faster than interest earning assets in the short term  as has been typical for us 
generally speaking  during a period of falling interest rates  net interest income would be higher than it would have been until interest rates stabilize 
during a period of rising interest rates  net interest income would be lower than it would have been until interest rates stabilize 
other important determinants of net interest income are general rate levels  balance sheet growth and mix  and interest rate spreads 
we continue to run a closely matched balance sheet by investing the majority of our assets in short duration  variable rate securities and adding interest rate swaps against client liabilities  including client repurchase agreements 
we manage the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by adjusting their mix  yield  maturity and or repricing characteristics based on market conditions 
client deposits and repurchase agreements  which are predominantly short term  are our primary sources of funds 
we also use term borrowings and interest rate swap agreements to augment our management of interest rate exposure 
the effect of the swap agreements is to lengthen short term variable rate liabilities into longer term fixed rate liabilities 
the weighted average fixed payment rates were and at december  and  respectively 
variable interest payments received are currently indexed to the overnight federal funds rate 
at december  and  the weighted average rate of variable market indexed interest payment obligations to the company were and  respectively 
the original terms range from to months 
these contracts had net fair values of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively

fixed rate loans are included in the period in which they are scheduled to be repaid 
mortgage backed securities are included in the pricing category that corresponds with the earlier of their first repricing date or principal paydown schedule generated from industry sourced prepayment projections 
excludes million of unsettled securities purchases and million of net unrealized gains as of december  liquidity liquidity represents the ability of an institution to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
for a financial institution such as ours  these obligations arise from the withdrawals of deposits and the payment of operating expenses 
our primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  federal reserve discount window  new deposits  short term borrowings  interest and principal payments on securities held to maturity and available for sale  and fees collected from asset administration clients 
as a result of our management of liquid assets and our ability to generate liquidity through liability funds  management believes that we maintain overall liquidity sufficient to meet our depositors needs  to satisfy our operating requirements and to fund the payment of an anticipated annual cash dividend of per share for approximately million based upon  shares outstanding as of december  
our ability to pay dividends on common stock may depend on the receipt of dividends from the bank 
any dividend payments by the bank are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the massachusetts commissioner of banks 
during all periods presented in this report  the company did not require dividends from the bank in order to fund the company s own dividends 
in addition  we may not pay dividends on our common stock if we are in default under certain agreements entered into in connection with the sale of our capital securities 
the capital securities were issued by investors capital trust i  icti  a delaware statutory business trust sponsored by us  and qualify as tier capital under the capital guidelines of the federal reserve 
we have informal borrowing arrangements with various counterparties 
each counterparty has agreed to make funds available to us at the federal funds overnight rate 
the aggregate amount of these borrowing arrangements as of december  was billion 
each bank may terminate its arrangement at any time and is under no contractual obligation to provide us with requested funding 
our borrowings under these arrangements are typically on an overnight basis 
we cannot be certain  however  that such funding will be available 
lack of availability of liquid funds could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
we also have master repurchase agreements in place with various counterparties 
each counterparty has agreed to make funds available to us at various rates in exchange for collateral consisting of marketable securities 
the aggregate amount of these borrowing arrangements at december  was billion 
on april   the federal home loan bank of boston fhlbb implemented a new capital structure mandated for all federal home loan banks by the gramm leach bliley act of and regulations that were subsequently promulgated in by the fhlbb s regulator  the federal housing finance board 
the bank s capital stock investment in the fhlbb totaled million as of december  the million capital stock investment includes both a million membership component and a million activity based component 
the bank s million capital stock investment in the fhlbb provides a borrowing capacity of approximately million 
under the new capital plan  fhlbb capital stock investments require a five year advance notice of withdrawal 
the amount outstanding under this arrangement at december  was million 
additional borrowing is available to the bank based on prescribed collateral levels and increased investment in fhlbb capital stock 
the bank currently has no plans to increase its investment in fhlbb capital stock

certain of these services were previously provided by eds 
the commitment to pay for these services is based upon transaction volumes and includes inflationary price clauses 
capital resources historically  we have financed our operations principally through internally generated cash flows 
we incur capital expenditures for furniture  fixtures  capitalized software and miscellaneous equipment needs 
we lease computing equipment through operating leases 
capital expenditures have been incurred and leases entered into on an as required basis  primarily to meet our growing operating needs 
as a result  our capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   capital expenditures were comprised of approximately million in capitalized software and projects in process  million in fixed assets  and million in leasehold improvements 
for the year ended december   capital expenditures were comprised of approximately million in capitalized software and projects in process  million in fixed assets  and million in leasehold improvements 
leasehold improvement expenditures for the year ended december  were primarily related to increased space in our dublin office  which was needed to support new business 
stockholders equity at december  was million  up from  primarily due to net income growth in and the issuance of common stock related to option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases 
the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets remained constant at approximately for december  and the frb has adopted capital adequacy guidelines applicable to united states banking organizations 
the frb s capital adequacy guidelines generally require bhcs to maintain total capital equal to of total risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items the total risk based capital ratio  with at least of that amount consisting of tier or core capital and the remaining amount consisting of tier or supplementary capital 
tier capital for bhcs generally consists of the sum of common stockholders equity and perpetual preferred stock subject to certain limitations  less goodwill and other nonqualifying intangible assets 
tier capital generally consists of hybrid capital instruments  perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt securities  perpetual preferred stock  not included as tier capital  term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock  and  subject to limitations  general allowances for loan and lease losses 
assets are adjusted under the risk based guidelines to take into account different risk characteristics 
in addition to the risk based capital requirements  the frb requires bhcs to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of tier capital to its average total consolidated assets the leverage ratio of 
total average consolidated assets for this purpose does not include goodwill and any other intangible assets and investments that the frb determines should be deducted from tier capital 
the frb has announced that the leverage ratio requirement is the minimum for the top rated bhcs 
all other bhcs are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 
bhcs with supervisory  financial  operational or managerial weaknesses  as well as bhcs that are anticipating or experiencing significant growth  are expected to maintain capital ratios well above the minimum levels 
because we anticipate significant future growth  we will be required to maintain a leverage ratio of or higher 
we are currently in compliance with both the total risk based capital ratio and the leverage ratio requirements  and management expects these ratios to remain in compliance with the frb s capital adequacy guidelines 
at december   our total risk based capital ratio and leverage ratio were and  respectively
