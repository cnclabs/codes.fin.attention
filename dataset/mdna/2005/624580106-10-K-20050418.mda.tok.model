item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general wholesale sales 
the primary factors that influence annual sales are general economic conditions in the company s domestic and international markets  new product introductions  the level and effectiveness of advertising and marketing expenditures and product pricing decisions 
approximately of the company s total sales are from international markets and therefore reported sales made in those markets are affected by foreign exchange rates 
significant portions of the company s international sales are billed in swiss francs and translated to us dollars at average exchange rates for financial reporting purposes 
with the acquisition of ebel in march of and the introduction of hugo boss watches  the company expects that a slightly higher percentage of its total sales will be derived from international markets in the future 
the company s business is seasonal 
there are two major selling seasons in the company s markets the spring season  which includes school graduations and several holidays and  most importantly  the christmas and holiday season 
major selling seasons in certain international markets center on significant local holidays that occur in late winter or early spring 
the company s net sales historically have been higher during the second half of the fiscal year 
the second half of the fiscal year accounted for approximately 
retail sales 
the company s retail operations consist of movado boutiques and outlet stores located throughout the united states 
the company does not have any retail operations outside of the united states 
the significant factors that influence annual sales volumes in the company s retail operations are similar to those that influence domestic wholesale sales 
in addition  many of the company s outlet stores are located near vacation destinations and  therefore  the seasonality of these stores is driven by the peak tourist seasons associated with these locations 
gross margins 
the company s overall gross margins are primarily affected by four major factors brand and product sales mix  product pricing strategy  manufacturing costs and the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate 
gross margins for the company may not be comparable to those of other entities  since some entities include all the costs related to its distribution network in cost of sales whereas the company does not include the costs associated with the us warehousing and distribution facility nor the occupancy costs for the retail segment in the cost of sales line item 
gross margins vary among the brands included in the company s portfolio and also among watch models within each brand 
watches in the luxury and premium price point categories generally earn lower gross margin percentages than moderate price models 
gross margins in the company s outlet business are lower than those of the wholesale business since the outlets primarily sell seconds and discontinued models that generally command lower selling prices 
gross margins from the sale of watches in the movado boutiques exceed those of the wholesale business since the company earns margins from manufacture to point of sale to the consumer 
all of the company s brands compete with a number of other brands on the basis of not only styling but also wholesale and retail price 
the company s ability to improve margins through price increases is therefore  to some extent  constrained by competitors actions 
costs of sales of the company s products consist primarily of component costs  internal assembly costs and unit overhead costs associated with the company s supply chain operations in switzerland and asia 
the company s supply chain operations consist of logistics management of assembly operations and product sourcing in switzerland and asia and assembly in switzerland 
through productivity improvement efforts  the company has controlled the level of overhead costs and maintained flexibility in its cost structure by outsourcing a significant portion of its component and assembly requirements and expects to extend this strategy over the near term 
since a substantial amount of the company s product costs are incurred in swiss francs  fluctuations in the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate can impact the company s production costs and  therefore  its gross margins 
the company hedges its swiss franc purchases using a combination of forward contracts  purchased currency options and spot purchases 
the company s hedging program had the effect of minimizing the exchange rate impact on product costs and gross margins 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
the company s sg a expenses consist primarily of advertising  selling  distribution and general and administrative expenses 
annual advertising expenditures are based principally on overall strategic considerations relative to maintaining or increasing market share in markets that management considers to be crucial to the company s continued success as well as on general economic conditions in the various markets around the world in which the company sells its products 
selling expenses consist primarily of salaries  sales commissions  sales force travel and related expenses  expenses associated with the basel watch and jewelry fair and other industry trade shows and operating costs incurred in connection with the company s retail business 
sales commissions vary with overall sales levels 
retail selling expenses consist primarily of salaries and store rents 
distribution expenses consist primarily of salaries of distribution staff  rental and other occupancy costs  security  depreciation and amortization of furniture and leasehold improvements and shipping supplies 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other employee compensation  employee benefit plan costs  office rent  management information systems costs  bad debts  patent and trademark expenses and various other general corporate expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and those significant policies are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements and the application of certain critical accounting policies require management to make judgments based on estimates and assumptions that affect the information reported 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to sales discounts and markdowns  product returns  bad debt  inventories  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources on historical experience  contractual commitments and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following are the critical accounting policies requiring significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in the wholesale segment  the company recognizes its revenues upon transfer of title and risk of loss in accordance with its fob shipping point terms of sale and after the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in the retail segment  transfer of title and risk of loss occurs at the time of register receipt 
the company records estimates for sales returns  volume based programs and sales and cash discount allowances as a reduction of revenue in the same period that the sales are recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical analysis  customer agreements and or currently known factors that arise in the normal course of business 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may be uncollectible in the future 
estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on the company s on going credit evaluations of the customers and customer payment history and account aging 
while the actual bad debt losses have historically been within the company s expectations and the allowances established  there can be no guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same bad debt loss rates 
as of january   the company knew of no situations with any of the company s major customers which would indicate the customer s inability to make their required payments 
inventories the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
the cost of finished goods and component inventories  held by overseas subsidiaries  are determined using average cost 
the company s management regularly reviews its sales to customers and customers sell through at retail to evaluate the adequacy of inventory reserves 
inventory with less than acceptable turn rates is classified as discontinued and  together with the related component parts which can be assembled into saleable finished goods  is sold through the company s outlet stores 
when management determines that finished product and components are unsaleable in the company s outlet stores  a reserve is established for the cost of those products and components 
these estimates could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements depending on future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions which may differ from the company s expectations 
long lived assets the company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of its depreciable assets based on factors including historical experience  the expected beneficial service period of the asset  the quality and durability of the asset and the company s maintenance policy including periodic upgrades 
changes in useful lives are made on a prospective basis unless factors indicate the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable and an impairment write down is necessary 
the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

when such a determination has been made  management compares the carrying value of the assets with their estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred  the loss is recognized during that period 
the impairment loss is calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the present value of estimated future cash flows or comparable market values  giving consideration to recent operating performance and pricing trends 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that the carrying value of its long lived assets in the movado boutique located in the soho section of new york city  might not be recoverable 
the impairment review was performed pursuant to sfas no 
because of an economic downturn affecting the soho boutique operations and revenue forecasts 
as a result  the company recorded a non cash pretax impairment charge of million consisting of property  plant and equipment of million and other assets of million 
the entire impairment charge is included in the selling  general and administrative expenses in the fiscal consolidated statements of income 
the company will continue to operate this boutique 
there were no impairment losses related to long lived assets in fiscal or warranty all watches sold by the company are covered by limited warranties against defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from two to three years from the date of purchase for movements and up to five years for the gold plating for movado watch cases and bracelets 
the company records an estimate for future warranty costs based on historical repair costs 
warranty costs have historically been within the company s expectations and the provisions established 
if such costs were to substantially exceed estimates  this could have an adverse affect on the company s operating results 
income taxes the company follows statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax laws and tax rates  in each jurisdiction the company operates  and applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in addition  the amounts of any future tax benefits are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent such benefits are not expected to be realized on a more likely than not basis 
the company calculates estimated income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for both book and tax purposes

 chapter sfas no 

the amendments made by sfas no 
will improve financial reporting by clarifying that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges by requiring the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   and is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure relates to foreign currency exchange risk see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the majority of the company s purchases are denominated in swiss francs 
the company reduces its exposure to the swiss franc exchange rate risk through a hedging program 
under the hedging program  the company manages most of its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis  which allows it to net certain exposures and take advantage of natural offsets 
the company uses various derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposures to currency fluctuations  predominantly forward and option contracts 
these derivatives either a are used to hedge the company s swiss franc liabilities and are recorded at fair value with the changes in fair value reflected in earnings or b are documented as sfas no 
cash flow hedges with the gains and losses on this latter hedging activity first reflected in other comprehensive income  and then later classified into earnings 
in both cases  the earnings impact is partially offset by the effects of currency movements on the underlying hedged transactions 
if the company did not engage in a hedging program  any change in the swiss franc to local currency would have an equal effect on the company s cost of sales 
in addition  the company hedges its swiss franc payable exposure with forward contracts 
as of january   the company s entire net forward contracts hedging portfolio consisted of million swiss francs equivalent for various expiry dates ranging through january  the company also has million swiss franc option contracts related to cash flow hedges for various expiry dates ranging through october  the company s board of directors authorized the hedging of the company s swiss franc denominated investment in its wholly owned swiss subsidiaries using purchase options under certain limitations 
these hedges are treated as net investment hedges under sfas no 
as of january   the company s purchased option hedge portfolio related to net investment hedging amounted to million swiss francs with various expiry dates ranging through september commodity risk additionally  the company has a hedging program related to gold used in the manufacturing of the company s watches 
under this hedging program  the company purchases various commodity derivative instruments  primarily future contracts 
these derivatives are documented as sfas no 
cash flow hedges  and gains and losses on these derivative instruments are first reflected in other comprehensive income  and later reclassified into earnings  partially offset by the effects of gold market price changes on the underlying actual gold purchases 
if the company did not engage in a gold hedging program  any changes in the gold price would have an equal effect on the company s cost of sales 
the company did not hold any futures contracts in its gold hedge portfolio related to cash flow hedges as of january  debt and interest rate risk in addition  the company has certain debt obligations with variable interest rates  which are based on libor plus a fixed additional interest rate 
the company does not hedge these interest rate risks 
the company also has certain debt obligations with fixed interest rates 
the differences between the market based interest rates at january   and the fixed rates were unfavorable 
the company believes that a change in interest rates would affect the company s net income by approximately million  which is not material
