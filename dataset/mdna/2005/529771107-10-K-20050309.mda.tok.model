item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto overview since its inception in  lexmark has become a leading developer  manufacturer and supplier of printing and imaging solutions for offices and homes 
lexmark s products include laser printers  inkjet printers  multifunction devices  associated supplies  services and solutions 
lexmark also sells dot matrix printers for printing single and multi part forms by business users and develops  manufactures and markets a broad line of other office imaging products 
the company is primarily managed along business and consumer market segments 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s reportable segments 
the total distributed office and home printing output opportunity has expanded as copiers and fax machines have been integrated into multifunction devices 
management believes that the integration of print copy fax capabilities favors companies like lexmark due to its experience in providing industry leading network printing solutions and multifunction printing products 
lexmark s management believes that its total revenue will continue to grow due to projected overall market growth for to in recent years  the company s growth rate in sales of printer units has generally exceeded the growth rate of its printer revenue due to sales price reductions and the introduction of new lower priced products in both the laser and inkjet printer markets 
in the laser printer market  this pricing pressure is partially offset by the tendency of customers to add higher profit margin optional features including network adapters  document management software  additional memory  paper handling and multifunction capabilities 
pricing pressure is also partially offset by the opportunity to provide business solutions and services to customers who are increasingly looking for assistance to better manage and leverage their document related costs and output infrastructure 
in the inkjet product market  advances in inkjet technology have resulted in products with higher resolution and improved performance while increased competition has led to lower prices 
additionally  the number of consumers seeking to print digitally captured images in their homes has driven significant growth in the photo printer and all in one products 
the greater affordability of inkjet printers  improvements in photo printing products  as well as the growth in the all in one category  have been important factors in the growth of this market 
as the installed base of lexmark laser printers  inkjet printers and multifunction devices continues to grow  management expects the market for supplies will grow as well  as such supplies are routinely required for use throughout the life of those products 
while profit margins on printers and multifunction products have been negatively affected by competitive pricing pressure  the supplies are a higher margin  recurring business  which the company expects to contribute to the stability of its earnings over time 
the company s dot matrix printers and other office imaging products include many mature products such as supplies for ibm branded printers  aftermarket supplies for certain competitors products and typewriter supplies that require little ongoing investment 
the company expects that the market for these products will continue to decline  and has implemented a strategy to continue to offer high quality products while managing cost to maximize cash flow and profit 
critical accounting policies and estimates lexmark s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  doubtful accounts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  copyright fees  product royalty obligations  restructurings  pension and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company records estimated reductions to revenue at the time of sale for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
estimated reductions in revenue are based upon historical trends and other known factors at the time of sale 
the company also provides price protection to substantially all of its reseller customers 
the company records reductions to revenue for the estimated impact of price protection when price reductions to resellers are anticipated 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time receivables are past due  the financial health of customers  unusual macroeconomic conditions and historical experience 
if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates or other circumstances occur that result in an impairment of customers ability to make payments  the company records additional allowances as needed 
warranty reserves the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the reserve for product warranties is based on the quantity of units sold under warranty  estimated product failure rates  and material usage and service delivery costs 
the estimates for product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs are periodically adjusted based on actual results 
to minimize warranty costs  the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
inventory reserves and adverse purchase commitments the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
the company estimates the difference between the cost of obsolete or unmarketable inventory and its market value based upon product demand requirements  product life cycle  product pricing and quality issues 
also  the company records an adverse purchase commitment liability when anticipated market sales prices are lower than committed costs 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs and adverse purchase commitment liabilities may be required 
long lived assets management considers the potential impairment of both tangible and intangible assets when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an asset impairment review estimates the fair value of an asset based upon the future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
such an impairment review incorporates estimates of forecasted revenue and costs that may be associated with an asset  expected periods that an asset may be utilized and appropriate discount rates 
pension and postretirement benefits the company s pension and non pension postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
examples of assumptions the company must make include selecting the following expected long term rate of return on plan assets  a discount rate that reflects the rate at which pension benefits could be settled and the anticipated rates of future compensation increases 
the company uses long term historical actual asset return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and future estimates of long term investment returns by reference to external sources to develop its expected return on plan assets 
this assumption is reviewed and set annually at the beginning of each year 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the calculation of net periodic cost benefit over five years 
the deferred amounts resulting from this averaging process are not expected to have a significant effect on the company s results of operations for the discount rate assumptions used for pension and non pension postretirement benefit plan accounting reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments at december each year 
the rate of future compensation increases is determined by the company based upon its long term plans for such increases 
actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future service period of the plan participants 
for  a basis point change in the assumptions for asset return  discount rate and compensation increases  would not have had a significant impact on the net periodic benefit cost 
changes in actual asset return experience and discount rate assumptions can impact the company s stockholders equity 
actual asset return experience results in an increase or decrease in the asset base and this effect  in conjunction with a decrease in the pension discount rate  may result in a plan s assets being less than a plan s accumulated benefit obligation abo 
the abo is the present value of benefits earned to date and is based upon past compensation levels 
the company is required to show in its consolidated statements of financial position a net liability that is at least equal to the abo less the market value of plan assets 
this liability is referred to as an additional minimum liability aml 
an aml  which is recorded and updated on december each year  is reflected as a long term pension liability with the offset in other comprehensive earnings loss in the equity section of the consolidated statements of financial position on a net of tax basis and or as an intangible asset to the degree the company has unrecognized prior service costs 
income taxes the company estimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes  as well as about the realization of deferred tax assets 
if the provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate  if the company is unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably  the company could potentially experience significant losses in excess of the reserves established 
likewise  if the provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  if the company is able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably  the company could potentially experience significant gains 
restructuring and other charges although the company had substantially completed all restructuring activities at december   and the employees had exited the business  approximately million of severance payments were made during refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s restructuring activities

the company acts to neutralize the effects of exchange rate fluctuations through the use of operational hedges  such as pricing actions and product sourcing decisions 
the company s exposure to exchange rate fluctuations generally cannot be minimized solely through the use of operational hedges 
therefore  the company utilizes financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on actual and anticipated cash flow exposures and certain assets and liabilities  which arise from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the company does not purchase currency related financial instruments for purposes other than exchange rate risk management

the company is not yet in a position to decide on whether  and to what extent  it might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the us based on the company s analysis to date  it is possible that the company could repatriate as much as million

factors that may affect future results and information concerning forward looking statements statements contained in this report which are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements are made based upon management s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects upon the company 
there can be no assurance that future developments affecting the company will be those anticipated by management  and there are a number of factors that could adversely affect the company s future operating results or cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the estimates or expectations reflected in such forward looking statements  including without limitation  the factors set forth below the company s future operating results may be adversely affected if it is unable to continue to develop  manufacture and market products that are reliable  competitive  and meet customers needs 
the markets for laser and inkjet products and associated supplies are aggressively competitive  especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new technologies and products offering improved features and functionality 
the impact of competitive activities on the sales volumes or revenue of the company  or the company s inability to effectively deal with these competitive issues  could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to maintain or grow retail shelf space or market share and on its financial results 
the company and its major competitors  many of which have significantly greater financial  marketing and or technological resources than the company  have regularly lowered prices on their products and are expected to continue to do so 
in particular  both the inkjet and laser printer markets have experienced and are expected to continue to experience significant price pressure 
price reductions on inkjet or laser products or the inability to reduce costs  including warranty costs  contain expenses or increase or maintain sales as currently expected  as well as price protection measures or a shift in the mix of products sold  could result in lower profitability and jeopardize the company s ability to grow or maintain its market share 
the introduction of products by the company or its competitors  or delays in customer purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product introductions by the company or its competitors and market acceptance of new products and pricing programs  any disruption in the supply of new or existing products due to quality issues  the reaction of competitors to any such new products or programs  the life cycles of the company s products  as well as delays in product development and manufacturing  and variations in the cost of component parts  may impact sales  may cause a buildup in the company s inventories  make the transition from current products to new products difficult and could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
the competitive pressure to develop technology and products and to increase marketing expenditures also could cause significant changes in the level of the company s operating expenses 
the company s performance depends in part upon its ability to successfully forecast the timing and extent of customer demand and manage worldwide distribution and inventory levels of the company and its resellers 
unexpected fluctuations in reseller inventory levels could disrupt ordering patterns and may adversely affect the company s financial results 
in addition  the financial failure or loss of a key customer or reseller could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the company must also be able to address production and supply constraints  including product disruptions caused by quality issues  and delays or disruptions in the supply of key components necessary for production  including without limitation component shortages due to increasing global demand in the company s industry and other industries 
such delays  disruptions or shortages may result in lost revenue or in the company incurring additional costs to meet customer demand 
the company s future operating results and its ability to effectively grow or maintain its market share may be adversely affected if it is unable to address these issues on a timely basis 
the company markets and sells its products through several sales channels 
the company has also advanced a strategy of forming alliances and oem arrangements with many companies 
the company s future operating results may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between or among its various sales channels  the loss of any alliance or oem arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space 
aggressive pricing on laser and inkjet products and or associated supplies from customers and resellers  including  without limitation  oem customers  could result in a material adverse impact on the company s strategy and financial results 
unfavorable global economic conditions may adversely impact the company s future operating results 
the company continues to experience some weak markets for its products  and although the company has seen some market improvement  continued softness in certain markets and uncertainty about global economic conditions could result in lower demand for the company s products 
weakness in demand has resulted in intense price competition and may result in excessive inventory for the company and or its reseller channel  which may adversely affect sales  pricing  risk of obsolescence and or other elements of the company s operating results 
revenue derived from international sales make up about half of the company s revenue 
accordingly  the company s future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade protection measures and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
in addition  changes in tax laws and the ability to repatriate cash accumulated outside the us in a tax efficient manner may adversely affect the company s financial results  investment flexibility and operations 
moreover  margins on international sales tend to be lower than those on domestic sales  and the company believes that international operations in new geographic markets will be less profitable than operations in the us and european markets  in part  because of the higher investment levels for marketing  selling and distribution required to enter these markets 
factors unrelated to the company s operating performance  including the financial failure or loss of significant customers  resellers  manufacturing partners or suppliers  the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental proceedings  and the ability to retain and attract key personnel  could also adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition  the company s stock price  like that of other technology companies  can be volatile 
trading activity in the company s common stock  particularly the trading of large blocks and intraday trading in the company s common stock  may affect the company s common stock price 
the company relies in large part on its international production facilities and international manufacturing partners  many of which are located in china  for the manufacture of its products and key components of its products 
future operating results may be adversely affected by several factors  including  without limitation  if the company s international operations or manufacturing partners are unable to perform or supply products reliably  if there are disruptions in international trade  disruptions at important geographic points of exit and entry  if there are difficulties in transitioning such manufacturing activities among the company  its international operations and or its manufacturing partners  or if there arise production and supply constraints which result in additional costs to the company 
the financial failure or loss of a key supplier could result in a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the company s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates 
in addition  the amount of income tax the company pays is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions 
a material assessment by a taxing authority or a decision to repatriate foreign cash could adversely affect the company s profitability 
although the company is currently the exclusive supplier of new cartridges for its laser and inkjet products  there can be no assurance that other companies will not develop new compatible cartridges for the company s products 
in addition  refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of the company s cartridges are available and compete with the company s supplies business 
the company expects competitive refill and remanufacturing activity to increase 
various legal challenges and governmental activities may intensify competition for the company s aftermarket supplies business 
the entrance of additional competitors that are focused on printing solutions could further intensify competition in the inkjet and laser printer markets and could have a material adverse impact on the company s strategy and financial results 
the company s inability to perform satisfactorily under service contracts for managed print services and other customer services may result in the loss of customers  loss of reputation and or financial consequences that may have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results and strategy 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents  copyrights and trademarks  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
current or future claims of intellectual property infringement could prevent the company from obtaining technology of others and could otherwise materially and adversely affect its operating results or business  as could expenses incurred by the company in obtaining intellectual property rights  enforcing its intellectual property rights against others or defending against claims that the company s products infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
certain countries primarily in europe and or collecting societies representing copyright owners interests have commenced proceedings to impose fees on devices such as scanners  printers and multifunction devices alleging the copyright owners are entitled to compensation because these devices enable reproducing copyrighted content 
other countries are also considering imposing fees on certain devices 
the amount of fees  if imposed  would depend on the number of products sold and the amounts of the fee on each product  which will vary by product and by country 
the financial impact on the company  which will depend in large part upon the outcome of local legislative processes  the company s and other industry participants outcome in contesting the fees and the company s ability to mitigate that impact by increasing prices  which ability will depend upon competitive market conditions  remains uncertain 
the outcome of the copyright fee issue could adversely affect the company s operating results and business 
the company depends on its information technology systems for the development  manufacture  distribution  marketing  sales and support of its products and services 
any failure in such systems  or the systems of a partner or supplier  may adversely affect the company s operating results 
furthermore  because vast quantities of the company s products flow through only a few distribution centers to provide product to various geographic regions  the failure of information technology systems or any other disruption affecting those product distribution centers could have a material adverse impact on the company s ability to deliver product and on the company s financial results 
terrorist attacks and the potential for future terrorist attacks have created many political and economic uncertainties  some of which may affect the company s future operating results 
future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to such attacks  and other acts of war or hostility may affect the company s facilities  employees  suppliers  customers  transportation networks and supply chains  or may affect the company in ways that are not capable of being predicted presently

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitivity the market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments and positions represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rates at december   the fair value of the company s senior notes was estimated at million using quoted market prices and yields obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of borrowing arrangements  taking into consideration the underlying terms of the debt 
the fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying value as recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position at december   by approximately million 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates and amounts to approximately million at december  the company has interest rate swaps that serve as a fair value hedge of the company s senior notes 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps at december   was a liability of million 
market risk for the interest rate swaps is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates and amounts to approximately million at december  foreign currency exchange rates the company employs a foreign currency hedging strategy to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements 
foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the company s functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which the company is exposed include the euro  the mexican peso  the canadian dollar  the british pound  the japanese yen  the australian dollar and other asian and south american currencies 
exposures are hedged with foreign currency forward contracts  put options  and call options with maturity dates of less than eighteen months 
the potential loss in fair value at december   for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately million 
this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures
