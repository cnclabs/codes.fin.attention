this program has been adopted by the texas state board of education 
advertising and marketing our advertising and marketing strategy is designed to establish leapfrog as the leading provider of engaging  effective and affordable learning solutions for the infant through high school audience and as a brand that parents and educators will seek to supplement a child s educational needs 
we use a variety of advertising and marketing tools to implement our strategy  including network and national cable television advertisements and national print advertisements that feature our leapfrog brand and our learn something new every day consumer campaign that highlights the educational nature and extended life of our products 
we are able to feature our products through cooperative print advertisements in local newspapers with key retail chains 
these advertisements  run by our retail partners such as toys r us  wal mart  kmart and target  highlight the availability of particular leapfrog products at these retail outlets 

table of contents in key retail stores  we feature our products via our learning center shelf displays  which are designed to highlight our leapfrog brand as the one stop solution for technology based educational products 
we have received additional brand exposure through television appearances by senior management and other television spots showcasing our products  often during the key holiday season 
our schoolhouse division utilizes a variety of advertising and marketing tools to build brand awareness in the education market  including placing advertisements in leading education publications targeting school administrators and teachers  and participating in key education trade shows and events 
sales and distribution a limited number of customers historically have accounted for a substantial portion of our net sales 
in  sales to wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales 
in  sales to wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales 
us consumer we market and sell our products primarily through national and regional mass market retail stores as well as specialty toy stores 
in  sales of our products to toys r us  wal mart including sam s club and target accounted for over of net sales in our us consumer segment and of our consolidated net sales 
our remaining us consumer retail sales came from sales of our products to specialty toy stores and  to a lesser extent  to book  electronics and office supply stores and other retailers 
our sales team works in conjunction with store buyers from our key retailers to forecast demand for our products  develop the store floor footprint  secure retail shelf space for our products and agree upon pricing components  including cooperative advertising allowances 
the large retail chains generally provide us with a preliminary forecast of their expected purchases of our products early in the year 
while these and subsequent forecasts are not contractually binding  they provide important feedback that we use in our planning process throughout the year 
we work closely with our key retailers during the year to establish and revise our expected demand forecasts and plan our production and delivery needs accordingly 
most retailers issue purchase orders to us  as they need product 
based on these purchase orders  we prepare shipments for delivery through various methods 
we sell to smaller retail stores through a combination of independent sales representatives and direct salespeople 
international consumer in  we established our uk office  located outside london  england  which sells our products directly to woolworth s  early learning centres  toys r us  argos and other leading uk retailers 
our emerging success in penetrating the uk consumer market is exemplified by the british association of toy retailers choosing our leappad platform as the top preschool toy for each of  and and naming leapfrog as company of the year in we coordinate distribution of our uk localized british english products into australia and new zealand from our office in emeryville  california 
in  we began selling directly to retailers in canada and in france and in we began selling directly to retailers in mexico 
prior to the establishment of overseas offices or subsidiaries  we utilize distribution arrangements to sell our products in other non english speaking countries  using separate distributors for the consumer and school markets as appropriate 
in markets where we do not establish direct sales  we plan on continuing to use these distribution arrangements 
paralleling our segmentation of the us market between consumer and school markets  we believe that overseas markets represent similar dual opportunities 
although we plan to develop most key consumer markets directly  we expect to seek a strategic education partner in key overseas markets given the costs and challenges associated with developing country by country curricula 

table of contents we currently have distribution arrangements with distributors in countries such as spain  korea  australia and new zealand 
in japan  benesse corporation is assisting us in developing the japanese supplemental educational materials market by distributing the cocopad system to its preschool through rd grade level subscribers

table of contents research and development hardware and software development to develop our products and content  we have assembled a team of technologists with backgrounds in a wide variety of fields including education  child development  hardware engineering  software development  video games and toys 
we have developed internally each of our current platforms and stand alone products  although we use licensed technology if it is advantageous to do so 
for example  we use a version of macromedia s flash player in our leapster platform  and we use optical scanning technology from anoto ab in our fly pentop computer platform  which is scheduled to be launched in fall we have successfully developed proprietary technologies that we use across a number of products in the markets we serve 
we have made innovations in the areas of touch detection technology  speech compression  music synthesis and content generation 
by combining technology developments in mixed signal application specific integrated circuits  or asics  we have been able to add features at comparatively low cost 
we have built internal expertise in hardware design  hardware synthesis  mixed signal custom asic design  real time embedded systems  software design  tools for packaging and compiling product content and mechanical engineering 
the research and development team participates in all phases of the product development process from concept through manufacturing launch 
content development our dedicated content production department has written scripts and designed a large majority of the art  audio and other content for our interactive books  activity cards and stand alone products  applying our own pedagogical approach that is based on established educational standards 
most of the members of our content production team have prior experience in the education  entertainment and educational software or video game industries 
we have developed a portion of our content using licensed characters such as disney princesses  thomas the tank engine  scooby doo and the characters from the movies finding nemo and the incredibles  and we plan to continue the use of licensed characters in our interactive books for our leappad family of platforms as well as content for our other platforms  such as dora the explorer  spider man and spongebob squarepants in interactive content for our leapster platform 
we launched our developer s studio in july  which consists of a team dedicated to creating software tools that help turn the content designed by our content developers into interactive content that works with our various platforms 
the tools developed by this team have shortened the time to market for our new interactive books 
in an effort to increase the amount and variety of content available for our platform products  we make these tools available to outside developers 
our developer s studio team trains and provides technical support to internal and external content development teams  and works with our production team to turn our internally developed content into interactive books 
finally  this team is responsible for managing the business relationships with our community of third party developers that are trained to create content for our platforms 
our research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in intellectual property we believe that the protection of our patents  trademarks  trade dress  copyrights and trade secrets is critical to our future success  and we aggressively protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual agreements 
as of december   we had over utility and design patents issued by the us patent and 
table of contents trademark office  as well as over issued internationally 
these include domestic and foreign patents related to our leappad platform technology  which do not expire before additionally  we have filed over patent applications pending in the united states and in other countries 
these pending applications include eight patent applications pending in the us and two in foreign countries related to our fly pentop computer  which we are planning to launch in fall we cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents  or that  if issued  any of these patents  or our patents that have already issued  will offer protection against competitors with similar technology 
as of december   we also had over us trademark registrations  including for marks incorporating leapfrog and the leappad and neartouch marks  as well as over foreign trademark registrations 
we also rely upon trade secrets  technical know how and continuing invention to develop and maintain our competitive position

for a discussion of how our intellectual property rights may not insulate us from claims of infringement by third parties  see and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors that may affect our results and stock price third parties have claimed  and may claim in the future  that we are infringing their intellectual property rights  which may cause us to incur significant litigation or licensing expenses or to stop selling some or all of our products or using some of our trademarks 
manufacturing  logistics and other operations our manufacturing and operations strategy is designed to maximize the use of outsourced services particularly with respect to the actual production and physical distribution of our products and to concentrate our internal resources on areas such as engineering  production planning and quality control 
we believe our outsourcing strategy also enhances the scalability of our manufacturing efforts 
in order to work closely with our manufacturing service providers  we have established offices in hong kong and macau 
we use several turnkey contract manufacturers to source components and build finished products to our specifications 
even though we outsource these services  we purchase and own the key raw materials and critical electronic components through the production cycle 
most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic and paper  and the majority of our products require electronic components 
we order our raw materials and electronic components on a purchase order basis 
the raw materials are readily available from a variety of sources  but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price 
some of our electronic components used to make our products  including our asics  currently come from a single supplier 
for information as to how this concentration of suppliers could affect our business  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors that may affect our results and stock price we do not have long term agreements with our major suppliers  and they may stop manufacturing our components at any time  and we depend on our suppliers for our components and raw materials  and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available 
we currently use contract manufacturers located in asia  primarily mainland china  to build our finished products 
these suppliers are selected based on their technical and production capabilities and are matched to particular products to achieve cost and quality efficiencies 
in addition  we have nine manufacturing suppliers in north america to address our specialized needs and fast turnaround requirements on a periodic basis for certain products 
we have our own quality assurance employees on site at the majority of our contract manufacturers 
during  and  jetta company limited  one of our manufacturers in china  supplied  and of our products  respectively  and our top three manufacturers combined supplied a total of  and of our products  respectively 
for information as to how this concentration of manufacturing could affect our business  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors that may affect our results and stock price we rely on a limited number of manufacturers  virtually all of which are located in china  to produce our finished products  and our reputation and operating results could be harmed if they fail to produce quality products in a timely manner and in sufficient 
table of contents quantities 
the majority of our us consumer products are shipped directly to our contract warehouse in fontana  california and are later shipped to meet the demands of our major us retailers and other smaller retailers and distributors throughout the united states 
the products for our international segment are either shipped directly to our international distributors or to local country contract warehouses from which the products are then shipped to meet the demands of our international distributors and customers 
the products for our education and training segment are shipped directly to our contract warehouse in chino  california and are later shipped to meet the demands of the educational institutions and educators who purchase our products 
information technology our information technology environment is built around an oracle system that supports our core order management  distribution  manufacturing and financial operations worldwide 
we are also in the process of implementing new applications that are intended to further improve our supply chain management capabilities 
these applications include supply chain planning software and warehouse management systems for our new distribution facility in fontana  california that began operating in july in addition  we also have software systems that we use for both sales analytics and financial planning 
for information as to how our information technology environment could affect our business  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors that may affect our results and stock price our rapid growth has presented significant challenges to our management systems and resources  particularly in our supply chain and information systems  and as a result we may experience difficulties managing our growth 
customer service we believe that our ability to establish and maintain long term relationships with consumers and retailers depends  in part  on the strength of our customer support and service operations 
we encourage and utilize frequent communication with and feedback from our customers and retailers to continually improve our products and service 
we have contracted with an outside customer service provider who operates hours a day  days a week during peak periods  specifically from november through january  and hours on weekdays  and hours on saturdays during off peak periods 
we offer toll free telephone support for consumers and retailers who prefer to talk directly with a customer service representative 
we also respond to email inquiries received through our website  and we have a team of in house customer service representatives who oversee and coordinate our customer service activities with our third party customer service provider 
in addition  on our website  we have a knowledge resource link that directs consumers to a frequently asked questions section  which we update as we receive consumer feedback 
we also have a dedicated retail sales service team 
this team works with our top retailers and provides point of sale related analysis for better forecasting and inventory plans 
our customer service and retail sales service teams are based in our emeryville  california facility 
competition we compete primarily in the infant and toddler category  preschool category and the electronic learning aids category of the us toy industry and  to some degree  in the overall us and international toy industries 
we believe the principal competitive factors impacting the market for our products in retail stores are brand  design  features  educational soundness  quality and price 
we believe that we compare favorably with many of our current competitors with respect to some or all of these factors 
our current principal competitors in the toy industry compete in the preschool category and include hasbro  inc  mattel  inc 
and vtech corporation 
in  mattel introduced a product under the name powertouch under its fisher price brand  and publications international  ltd 
introduced a product under the name activepad  each having functionality similar to that of some of the platforms in our leappad family of platforms 
in june  toshiba corporation began selling an interactive educational platform product in japan under the name ex pad 
we also compete with educational software publishers  such as knowledge adventure a studio of vivendi universal games  whose products have distribution at mass retailers and electronics and toy stores  and with producers of popular handheld game platforms  such as nintendo co  ltd 
and sony corporation  whose products may compete with our leapster 
table of contents platform 
further  in  vtech introduced a television based educational game system called v 
smile  and recently announced that it will be launching a portable version of that game system  each of which competes with our leapster and leapster l max systems 
we believe that producers of smart mobile devices  such as personal digital assistants  non mobile game platforms and computer based software may be able to compete effectively in our primary markets by developing engaging educational products that run on their platforms 
these companies have significantly larger installed bases than we do 
in addition  a number of major hardware and software makers have developed pen based portable computers like the tablet pc that could compete with some of our products  such as our leappad family of platforms and our new fly pentop computer 
consequently  competitors may include companies like acer inc  apple computer  inc  fujitsu limited  hewlett packard company  microsoft corporation  nec corporation  palmone  inc  palmsource  inc  sega corporation  and toshiba 
many of our direct  indirect and potential competitors have significantly longer operating histories  greater brand recognition and substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
our schoolhouse division competes in the us supplemental educational materials market 
we believe the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products in the school market are educational soundness  proven effectiveness  brand  features and price 
our schoolhouse division faces competition in the supplemental curriculum market from major textbook publishers such as harcourt a division of reed elsevier  houghton mifflin company  mcgraw hill  pearson plc and scholastic corporation  as well as electronic educational material and service providers such as knowledge adventure  plato learning  inc  renaissance learning and riverdeep group plc 
many of the companies with whom we compete have significantly more experience in the supplemental educational materials market and greater resources than we do 
in the future  large entertainment companies such as viacom international  inc and walt disney co 
may begin to target the school markets 
for a discussion of the possible effects that competition could have on our business  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors that may affect our results and stock price if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors  our sales and market share could decline 
seasonality our business is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 
the majority of our net sales and all of our net income generally are realized during the third and fourth calendar quarters 
in addition  our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past  and can be expected to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future  as a result of many factors  including seasonal influences on our sales  such as the holiday shopping season and back to school purchasing  unpredictable consumer preferences and spending trends  the need to increase inventories in advance of our primary selling season  and the timing of introductions of new products 
for more information  see seasonality and quarterly results of operations and risk factors that may affect our results and stock price our business is seasonal  and therefore our annual operating results depend  in large part  on sales relating to the brief holiday season in item of this form k

overview we design  develop and market technology based educational platforms  related interactive content and stand alone products for sale to retailers  distributors and schools 
we operate three business segments  which we refer to as us consumer  international  and education and training 
to date  we have sold our products predominantly through the toy sections of major retailers 
for further information regarding our three business segments  see note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
leapfrog s mission is to become the leading brand for quality  technology based educational products for home  school and work for all ages around the world 
we believe that leapfrog is in the early stage of accomplishing this mission 
to date  we have established our brand and products largely focused on infants  toddlers  and children in preschool through grade school and primarily in the us retail market 
we believe that leapfrog is  first and foremost  an educational products company  and we use the toy form and price points to make learning fun and cost effective 
as a result  our sales in our us consumer and international segments  our 
table of contents largest business segments  currently are generated in the toy aisles of retailers 
the market for toy retailers has seen  and continues to see consolidation 
in addition to the traditional channel of specialty toy retailers  of which toys r us has become the major player  the mass market retail channel has grown in importance 
for example  wal mart  target and a number of regional mass market retailers have seen growth in their market shares within the us toy retail market 
the mass market retailers have certain competitive advantages in the highly seasonal toy market because they have the ability to dedicate a significant amount of shelf space to toys during the fall holiday season  and then reduce the allocated shelf space for toys during the rest of the year 
we anticipate that the toy industry s dependence on mass market retailers will continue to grow 
in our us consumer segment  we market and sell our products directly to national and regional mass market and specialty retailers as well as to other retail stores through sales representatives 
our us consumer segment is our most developed business  and is subject to significant seasonal influences  with the substantial majority of our sales occurring in the third and fourth quarters 
in  this segment represented approximately of our total net sales 
although we are expanding our retail presence by selling our products to bookstores and electronics and office supply stores  the significant majority of our us consumer sales are to a few large retailers 
sales to wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target accounted for approximately of our us consumer segment sales in compared to in and in as a percentage of our consolidated net sales  sales to wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated net sales in  and  respectively 
net sales in our us consumer segment decreased by from to and operating income decreased from a profit of million to a loss of million 
consistent with industry practice  we rely on short term purchase orders for the sale of our products to us retailers 
although we believe net sales for this business segment will grow in the future  we anticipate that this segment s percentage of total company net sales will decrease  as we expect our other two segments to grow at a faster rate than our us consumer segment 
in our international segment  we sell our products outside the united states directly to overseas retailers and through various distribution and strategic arrangements 
we have four direct sales offices in the united kingdom  canada  france and mexico  and maintain various distribution and strategic arrangements in countries such as australia  japan and korea among others 
the international segment represented approximately of our total net sales in net sales in our international segment increased from to and operating income decreased from million in to million in despite the large increase in sales in our international segment in  we experienced a slowdown in leappad platform sales by our major customers in canada and the united kingdom during the fourth quarter of this trend indicates that leappad platform sales are maturing in these countries and that growth in our international segment in will be much lower than our education and training segment  which is represented almost entirely by our schoolhouse division  targets the school market in the united states  including sales directly to educational institutions  to teacher supply stores and through catalogs aimed at educators 
the education and training segment represented approximately of our total net sales in net sales in our education and training segment increased by from to  and the segment had operating income of million in compared to an operating loss of million in we expect growth in our education and training segment to continue in gross profit percentage in decreased by percentage points from in to in this decrease was primarily due to lower profit margins in our us consumer segment  partially offset by growth in our higher margin education and training and international segments 
the decrease in gross profit percentage in our us consumer segment was the result of lower margin leapster platform sales  as well as higher freight and warehousing expenses 
in addition  inventory reserves were increased by million due to obsolete and defective inventory of raw materials and discontinued finished goods 
the increase in reserves was due  at least in part  to significantly lower sales in the fourth quarter versus expectation for products to be discontinued in selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related employee benefits  legal  marketing expenses  systems costs  rent and office equipment and supplies 
our research and development 
table of contents expenses consist primarily of costs associated with content development  product development and product engineering 
our advertising expenses consist primarily of television advertising  cooperative advertising and in store displays 
depreciation and amortization expenses consist primarily of depreciation of fixed assets and capitalized website development and amortization of intangibles  however it excludes depreciation of manufacturing tools and capitalized content development  which are classified in cost of sales 
leapfrog realignment plan in the first quarter of  we announced a three pronged company wide realignment initiative designed to address the following objectives restore profitability  strengthen our infrastructure and business processes  and generate growth 
restore profitability 
a necessary part of this objective is a restructuring of our workforce and a reduction of over full time and temporary employees in the us consumer segment and the international segment 
we expect headcount increases in the schoolhouse division to partially offset these reductions 
the costs of the restructuring will be million to million  to be recognized in the first quarter of through these actions  together with other cost containment efforts  we are targeting savings of million to million  excluding the impact of increased expenses for the schoolhouse division and the impact of changes in accounting for stock options 
in addition to the aforementioned cost reductions  we have also embarked on a deliberate strategy to better leverage our assets and investments to improve returns 
this includes leveraging technology across products and platforms  utilizing our content assets and development tools across divisions  and realizing the global potential of the products from the outset of our product development planning cycle to minimize development costs and maximize sales and profitability 
strengthen our infrastructure and business processes 
we are focusing efforts on addressing the problems we have experienced in the supply chain by recruiting employees with supply chain expertise and improving our distribution center for our us consumer segment and the related information technology systems 
we recently hired a new chief information officer and are searching for an executive to be in charge of our supply chain 
we are also implementing a new company wide three year planning process that will allow us to plan our business and investments over a longer horizon 
an important part of improving our infrastructure and business processes is to address and remediate the internal control issues that have been identified and discussed elsewhere in this report 
see item a controls and procedures 
this remediation process entails systematically examining each part of the business to improve  document  and monitor compliance with financial controls 
we intend to make the improvements to our internal control over financial reporting in concert with the actions we are taking to improve the systems used throughout the company for general business planning and operation 
additionally  we have been  and will continue to  strengthen the capabilities in organization with the addition of individuals with the capability to strengthen internal controls  including the addition of a new chief financial officer  who joined us in november and a new treasurer  who joined us in december generate growth 
as we implement our realignment plan to implement greater business disciplines and processes  we also intend to seek opportunities to generate growth over the long term 
we intend to achieve this goal by targeting 
table of contents new and existing markets that can generate sales at high margins and by developing new technology platforms that will be successful in the markets we target at profit margins that are greater than our current margins 
our schoolhouse division continues to be a strong emerging business for us 
this business generated operating profit in  and we plan to continue to invest in this business for growth in internationally  we are focusing on the markets in which we have been able to build our brand and penetrate the consumer markets with high margin products 
in addition  in fall  we expect to launch our new fly pentop computer platform  which targets the middle school age group  a consumer market that we have not focused on in the past 
also in fall  we are extending the product line for our leapster system  our screen based technology platform  by launching our leapster l max system  which is our first entry into television based entertainment and education platforms 
we believe that by continuing to develop and introduce technology platforms for new and broader markets  we will be able to grow our business over the long term 
as we achieve the goals of our realignment plan  we expect some improvement in our operations in the short term 
nonetheless  the full benefit of our actions will not be realized until after critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and reported disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for accounts receivable  inventories and related allowances  intangible assets and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  some of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  are the most significant in affecting judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products provided that there are no significant post delivery obligations to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances based primarily on volume purchasing levels  estimated returns  allowances for defective products  markdowns  and other sales allowances 
a small portion of our revenue related to training  subscriptions and our mind station product is deferred and recognized as revenue over a period of one to months 
we deferred less than of net sales in  and allowances for accounts receivable we reduce accounts receivable by an allowance for amounts we believe will become uncollectible 
this allowance is an estimate based primarily on our management s evaluation of the customer s financial condition  past collection history and aging of the receivable 
if the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorates  resulting in impairment of its ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents we provide estimated allowances for product returns  charge backs  promotions and defectives on product sales in the same period that we record the related revenue 
we estimate our allowances by utilizing historical information for existing products 
for new products  we estimate our allowances for product returns on specific terms for product returns and our experience with similar products 
in estimating returns  we analyze i historical returns and sales patterns  ii analysis of credit memo data  iii current inventory on hand at customers  iv changes in demand  and v introduction of new products 
we continually assess our historical experience and adjust our allowances as appropriate  and consider other known factors 
if actual product returns  charge backs  promotions and defective products are greater than our estimates  additional allowances may be required 
historically  our estimated reserves for accounts receivables  returns  charge backs  promotions and defectives have been adequate to cover actual charges 
in the third quarter of  we changed our disclosure of receivable allowances to include only allowances for doubtful accounts to better conform to the prevailing practice in our industry 
our other receivable allowances include allowances for product returns  charge backs  defective products and promotional markdowns 
these other allowances totaled million at december  and million at december  the increase in other receivable allowances was primarily due to allowances for short shipments and service related sales allowances  and to a lesser extent  higher promotional allowances 
these amounts are now treated as reductions of gross accounts receivable 
all prior period financial statements have been adjusted to conform to the current period s presentation 
inventories and related allowance for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost  on a first in  first out basis  or market value and are reduced by an allowance for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories 
our estimate for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories is based on our management s review of on hand inventories compared to their estimated future usage and demand for our products 
if actual future usage and demand for our products are less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
for example  lower than planned sales in resulted in higher charges for excess and obsolete raw materials and finished goods 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory were million in intangible assets intangible assets  including excess purchase price over the cost of net assets acquired goodwill  arose from our september  acquisition of substantially all the assets and business of our predecessor  leapfrog rbt  and our acquisition of substantially all the assets of explore technologies on july  at december   our intangible assets had a net balance of million 
the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires the use of a nonamortization approach to account for goodwill and some other intangible assets 
we adopted the pronouncement effective january   and accordingly we no longer amortize goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
as of december   we had million  net  of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  which are no longer subject to amortization 
at december   we tested our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment based on the fair value of the cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future  known as the income approach 
based on this assessment we determined that no adjustments were necessary to the stated values 
intangible assets also include patents  and trademarks and licenses  which include a ten year technology license agreement entered into in january to jointly develop and customize our optical scanning technology 
the determination of related useful lives and whether the intangible assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require that adjustments be recorded to asset balances 
we review intangible assets  as well as other long lived assets  for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 

table of contents content development  home video production and tooling capitalization our management is required to use its judgment in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
we capitalize the prepublication costs of books as content development costs 
only costs incurred with outside parties are capitalized 
in  we capitalized million of content development costs  million of which pertained to our education and training segment 
in  we capitalized million in content development costs  million of which pertained to our education and training segment

bender  our president  worldwide consumer group  entered into new employment agreements providing for  among other things  acceleration of vesting and extension of the exercise period of their stock options upon the termination of their employment by leapfrog without cause or by the employee for good reason as defined in the agreements or a change in control of leapfrog during the term of the applicable agreement 
under applicable accounting principles  upon any termination of employment or change in control resulting in such acceleration or extension  we would be required to recognize compensation expense 
the amount of any such compensation expense would depend on the number of option shares affected by the acceleration or extension and could be material to our financial results 
prior to our july initial public offering  we granted stock appreciation rights under our amended and restated employee equity participation plan that are measured at each period end against the fair value of the class a common stock at that time 
the resulting difference between periods is recognized as expense at each period end measurement date based on the vesting of the rights 
concurrent with the initial public offering of our class a common stock  we stopped granting stock appreciation rights under our employee equity participation plan 
in february  we converted  stock appreciation rights into options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of class a common stock 
deferred compensation of approximately million related to the unvested portion will be amortized to expense through the second quarter of as the options vest

income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
our tax provision includes sufficient accruals for possible future assessments that may result from the examination of federal  state  or international tax returns 
our tax contingency accruals may be adjusted if there are changes in circumstances  such as changes in tax law  tax audits  or other factors  which may cause management to revise its estimates 
the amounts ultimately paid on any possible future assessments may differ from the amounts accrued and may result in an increase or reduction to the effective tax rate in the year of resolution

the net sales decrease in this segment year over year was primarily a result of the following factors lower sales of our more established platforms and related software  primarily the classic leappad system  and to a lesser extent  our my first leappad and quantum leappad systems 
this was partially offset by higher sales of leapster and littletouch platforms and software

our international segment s net sales increased by million  or  from million in to million in on a constant currency basis  net sales increased from to the favorable currency impact was due to the strength of the canadian dollar and the british pound  and to a lesser extent  the euro 
the increase in our international segment was primarily due to higher sales in the united kingdom and canada  and to a lesser extent  increased sales in france 
increases were primarily due to greater market penetration resulting from more localized products and increased brand awareness 
higher sales to distributors 
sales increased in australia due to an effective marketing campaign conducted by our distributor  which resulted in increased shelf space and brand awareness  and in  we entered into the german language market in europe 
a decrease in sales to korea due to the termination of our relationship with our primary distributor  which partially offset sales gains 
despite the large increase in sales in our international segment in  we experienced a slowdown in leappad platform sales by our major customers in canada and the united kingdom during the fourth quarter of this trend indicates that leappad platform sales are maturing in these countries and that growth in our international segment in will be much slower

the percentage point decrease in our us consumer segment s gross profit percentage year over year was primarily the result of the following lower sales of products that carry a relatively high margin  such as leappad software and hardware  offset by growing sales in new  lower margin products  such as the leapster product line 
we are seeking to build a large base of installed leapster platform users that will lead to the sale of higher margin leapster software 
we estimate that the impact of this unfavorable product mix contributed to a five percentage point decline in the gross profit percentage in versus higher charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million over inventory reserves were increased due to obsolete and defective inventory comprised of raw materials and discontinued finished goods 
the increase in reserves was due  at least in part  to significantly lower sales in the fourth quarter versus expectation for products to be discontinued in the increase in excess and obsolete inventories resulted in three percentage points of the decline in gross profit percentage in versus higher fixed expenses  in dollars and as a percentage of net sales  including higher warehousing and freight resulting from higher inventory levels  and higher depreciation of capitalized tooling expenses resulting from tooling write offs associated with discontinued products 
increased expenses were primarily attributed to operating inefficiencies incurred at our new distribution facility in fontana  california 
we estimate that these expenses contributed two percentage points of the decline in gross profit percentage in versus price reductions on our established platforms  primarily our classic leappad  which was implemented to drive future sales of these platforms and their related software products 
we estimate that these price reductions resulted in one percentage point of the decline in gross profit percentage in higher sales allowances granted to customers due to operational issues encountered during the start up of our new distribution facility 
we estimate that these allowances resulted in one percentage point of the decline in gross profit percentage in international 
the percentage point decrease in our international segment s gross profit percentage year over year was primarily due to a higher percentage of sales derived from lower margin platforms

the majority of our net sales and all of our net income generally are realized during the third and fourth calendar quarters 
in addition  our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past  and can be expected to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future  as a result of many factors  including seasonal influences on our sales  such as the holiday shopping season and back to school purchasing  unpredictable consumer preferences and spending trends  the need to increase inventories in advance of our primary selling season  and the timing of introductions of new products 
for a discussion of these and other factors affecting seasonality  see risk factors that may affect our results and stock price our business is seasonal  and therefore our annual operating results will depend  in large part  on sales relating to the brief holiday season and our quarterly operating results are susceptible to fluctuations that could cause our stock price to decline

during  we continued to experience significant operational difficulties associated with our supply chain operations  including inventory planning and logistics 
additionally  we experienced significant difficulties associated with the opening of our new fontana  california distribution facility 
this facility  which is operated by a third party logistics firm  began shipping products in august inventories consisted of the following december  change raw materials work in process finished goods reserves inventories  net in millions 
the million increase in inventory from december  to december  consisted of the following million increase in finished goods consisting primarily of leapster platforms and related software and certain stand alone products  million increase in finished goods in the international segment  million increase in raw materials due to longer lead times in our manufacturing process and new product components primarily related to leapster platform products  and million increase in work in process relating to our assumption of all risks and benefits of component parts and materials under the manufacturing agreements that we entered into with our contract manufacturers 
these increases in inventory were partially offset by million increase in obsolete and excess inventory reserves 
accounts payable accounts payable decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to timing of accounts payable payments and decreased inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of inventory purchases were lowered due to the slowdown in sales in the third and fourth quarters of accrued liabilities accrued liabilities increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase in accrued liabilities consisted primarily of a million increase in accrued cooperative advertising  higher legal expenses  and an overall increase in operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents income taxes payable income taxes payable increased to million at december  from million at december  substantially all of our income tax payments are made in december and march due to the seasonality of our business 
in  million in income tax payments were made compared to million in the same period of the lower income tax payments were primarily due to the tax deduction received for the exercise of stock options in  which resulted in a reduction of income taxes payments of approximately million in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million the primary components of net cash used in investing activities for compared to were net sale of short term investments of million in compared with net purchases of short term investments of million in purchase of property and equipment of million in  primarily related to our supply chain initiatives and manufacturing tools 
in  we used million for purchases of property and equipment related primarily to computers and software and manufacturing tools 
purchase of intangible assets of million  related primarily to a technology license agreement we entered into in the first quarter of in  we used million for the purchase of intangible assets for certain trademark rights in connection with the settlement of a lawsuit 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million for the same period in the primary component of cash provided by financing activities in both years was proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and purchases of our common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
included in is the receipt of million from the payment of notes receivable from stockholders 
contractual obligations we conduct our corporate operations from leased facilities and lease some equipment under operating leases 
generally  these have initial lease periods of three to twelve years and contain provisions for renewal options of five years at market rates 
the following table summarizes our outstanding long term contractual obligations at december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating leases royalty guarantees total we have provided irrevocable standby letters of credit to several of our inventory manufacturers and one technology partner 
the standby letters of credit guarantee performance of the obligations of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to pay for trade payables and contractual obligations of up to million 
of the million  million is fully secured by cash deposits with the issuer 
during january  million of the million of outstanding letters of credit expired or were cancelled and related cash collateral of million was released 
the cash collateral related to the million is classified in restricted cash on our balance sheet at december  
table of contents in january  we entered into a ten year technology license agreement with a foreign company to jointly develop and customize our respective technologies to be combined in a platform and related licensed products 
the agreement called for contractual payments of million in license fees in and million in advance royalties payable in additionally  we paid million of engineering fees subject to attainment of specific milestones 
in april  we entered into a lease for a distribution center located in fontana  california 
the lease is for a building with approximately  square feet and has a term that expires in december our minimum lease obligations over the term of the lease are million 
in march  we amended our lease agreement for our corporate offices in emeryville  california to extend the term of the lease from january  to march  the minimum lease obligations under the amended lease agreement are million 
this commitment is included in the above schedule 
change in results from reported earnings on february  we reported our preliminary  unaudited results for fiscal these preliminary results differed slightly from the results included in this report on form k 
changes from the preliminary results are as follows net sales increased million to million  due to the reduction of sales allowances  costs of goods sold decreased million due to lower inventory reserves  and operating expenses decreased by million due to changes in various expense accruals 
the three preceding factors caused a reduction of our loss from operations by million from million to million  net loss by million from million to million  and net loss per share by per share from per share to per share

recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fas no 
 inventory costs  or fas fas clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight handling costs and waste material spoilage 
the statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  the statement requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have any material impact on our results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under 
table of contents the fair value method  and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no 
 and allowed under the original provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value  which is amortized to expense over the service periods 
the requirements of sfas no 
r are effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  if we had applied the provisions of sfas no 
r to our consolidated financial statements for the period ending december   using the black scholes model our net loss would have increased by approximately million 
sfas no 
r allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition  which may be back to the original issuance of sfas no 
or only to interim periods in the year of adoption 
we are currently evaluating these transition methods 
risk factors that may affect our results and stock price our business and our stock price are subject to many risks and uncertainties that may affect our future financial performance 
some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our operating results to vary or that may materially and adversely affect our operating results are as follows if we fail to predict consumer preferences and trends accurately  develop and introduce new products rapidly or enhance and extend our existing core products  our sales will suffer 
sales of our platforms  related software and stand alone products typically have grown in the periods following initial introduction  but we expect sales of specific products to decrease as they mature 
for example  in  we experienced a significant decrease in the net sales of our classic leappad and my first leappad business in our us consumer segment compared to the introduction of new products and the enhancement and extension of existing products  through the introduction of additional software or by other means  are critical to our future sales growth 
the successful development of new products and the enhancement and extension of our current products will require us to anticipate the needs and preferences of consumers and educators and to forecast market and technological trends accurately 
consumer preferences  and particularly children s preferences  are continuously changing and are difficult to predict 
in addition  educational curricula change as states adopt new standards 
the development of new interactive learning products requires high levels of innovation and this process can be lengthy and costly 
to remain competitive  we must continue to develop enhancements of our neartouch and other technologies successfully  as well as successfully integrate third party technology with our own 
in fall  we plan to introduce a number of new platforms  stand alone products and interactive books and other software for each of our three business segments  including our fly pentop computer  which is targeted at an older age group of consumers than we have focused on in the past  and our leapster l max handheld for television based learning 
we cannot assure you that these products will be successful or that other products will be introduced or  if introduced  will be successful 
the failure to enhance and extend our existing products or to develop and introduce new products that achieve and sustain market acceptance and produce acceptable margins would harm our business and operating results 
our business is seasonal  and therefore our annual operating results depend  in large part  on sales relating to the brief holiday season 
sales of consumer electronics and toy products in the retail channel are highly seasonal  causing the substantial majority of our sales to retailers to occur during the third and fourth quarters 
in  approximately of our total net sales occurred during this period 
this percentage of total sales may increase as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through just in time inventory management systems 
generally  retailers time their orders so that suppliers like us will fill the orders closer to the time of purchase by consumers  thereby reducing their need to maintain larger on hand inventories throughout the year to meet demand 
while these techniques reduce retailers investments in their inventory  they increase pressure on suppliers to fill orders promptly and shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to suppliers like us 
the logistics of supplying more products within shorter time periods will increase the risk that we fail to meet tight shipping schedules  which could damage our relationships with retailers  increase our shipping costs or 
table of contents cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost 
for example  in the second half of  we had operational difficulties related to our new us distribution center  which had an adverse impact on our financial results 
the seasonal pattern of sales in the retail channel requires significant use of our working capital to manufacture and carry inventory in anticipation of the holiday season  as well as early and accurate forecasting of holiday sales 
failure to predict accurately and respond appropriately to consumer demand on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations  or any disruption of consumer buying habits during this key period  would harm our business and operating results 
our quarterly operating results are susceptible to fluctuations that could cause our stock price to decline 
historically  our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly 
for example  our net income loss for the first  second  third and fourth quarters of was million  million  million and million  respectively 
our net income loss for the first through fourth quarters of was million  million  million and million  respectively 
we expect these fluctuations to continue for a number of reasons  including seasonal influences on our sales  such as the holiday shopping season and back to school purchasing  the mix of higher and lower margin products purchased by our customers and consumers  unpredictable consumer preferences and spending trends  the need to increase inventories in advance of our primary selling season  timing of new product introductions  general economic conditions  the availability and cost of components  materials and shipping services for our products  the financial condition of our retail customers  our ability to more efficiently manage our shipping and logistics operations  the results of legal proceedings  changes in our pricing policies  the pricing policies of our competitors and general pricing trends in consumer electronics and toy markets  international sales volume and the mix of such sales among countries with similar or different holidays and school years than the united states  the impact of strategic relationships  the sales cycle to schools  which may be uneven  depending on budget constraints  the timing of purchases and other seasonal influences  and the timing of orders by our customers and our ability to fulfill those orders in a timely manner  or at all 
for example  toys r us  one of our key customers  is currently undergoing an announced strategic evaluation and potential sale of some or all of its worldwide operations and assets that may affect its buying patterns  buying levels and number of total retail outlets 
in turn  the effects of any change in orders from toys r us or other retailers could have a material effect on our quarterly operating results 
we expect that we will continue to incur losses during the first and second quarters of each year for the foreseeable future 
if we fail to meet our projected net sales or other projected operating results  or if we fail to meet analysts or investors expectations  the market price of our class a common stock could decrease 

table of contents if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our future financial results and our management may not be able to provide its report on the effectiveness of our internal controls as required by the sarbanes oxley act 
our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   and this assessment identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
discussion of these weaknesses and our responsive measures are summarized in item a 
controls and procedures of this report 
although our independent auditors have issued an unqualified opinion on our financial statements and we have taken steps to correct the internal control deficiencies that resulted in these material weaknesses  the efficacy of the steps we have taken to date and the steps we are still in the process of taking to improve the reliability of our financial statements in the future are subject to continued management review supported by confirmation and testing by our internal auditors  as well as oversight by the audit committee of our board of directors 
we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or prevent us from accurately reporting our financial results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations in the future 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify further material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date 
insufficient internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could result in the decrease of the market price of our class a common stock 
our rapid growth has presented significant challenges to our management systems and resources  particularly in our supply chain and information systems  and as a result we may experience difficulties managing our growth 
we have grown rapidly  both domestically and internationally 
our net sales were million in and million in during this period  the number of different products we offered at retail also increased significantly  and we have opened offices in canada  france  macau and mexico 
at december   we had full time employees and at march   we had full time employees 
we are upgrading existing and implementing new operational information systems  including supply chain management systems 
further  in july  we began consolidating multiple third party distribution warehouses into a single distribution warehouse to handle our needs  and this warehouse is being operated by a new third party logistics service provider 
during the second half of  we had significant difficulties operating our management systems and the new consolidated distribution center during our peak shipping season 
this expansion has presented  and continues to present  significant challenges for our management systems and resources and has resulted in a significant adverse impact on our operating and financial results 
if we fail to improve and maintain management systems and resources sufficient to keep pace with our business needs  our operating results could continue to suffer 
we depend on key personnel  and we may not be able to retain  hire and integrate sufficient qualified personnel to maintain and expand our business 
our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executives  technical  sales  marketing  manufacturing and administrative personnel 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel could harm our business 
the loss of the services of any of our officers or senior managers  or our inability to fill or delay in filling key positions  could disrupt operations in their respective departments and could cause our financial results to suffer 
recruiting and retaining skilled personnel is highly competitive 
if we fail to retain  hire  train and integrate qualified employees and contractors  we will not be able to maintain and expand our business 
in addition  several members of our senior management have been with us for less than one year  including our chief financial officer  chief marketing officer and chief information officer  and we are currently searching for a new senior executive to be in charge of our supply chain 
any failure to integrate these senior officers into our business or to manage our expansion effectively could harm our business 

table of contents we currently rely  and expect to continue to rely  on our leappad family of platforms and related interactive books for a significant portion of our sales 
our classic leappad  leappad plus writing and quantum leappad platforms  each of which is based on our neartouch technology  together with interactive books related to those platforms that are generally compatible with any of those platforms  accounted for an aggregate of approximately of our net sales in our my first leappad platform and my first leappad interactive books accounted for an aggregate of approximately of our net sales in  and our leapster learning system and its interactive software accounted for an aggregate of approximately of our net sales in no other product line  together with any related software  accounted for more than approximately of our net sales through a significant portion of our future sales will depend on the continued commercial success of our classic leappad  leappad plus writing  quantum leappad platforms and compatible interactive books  our my first leappad platforms and related interactive books  and our leapster learning system and related interactive software 
if the sales for our classic leappad  leappad plus writing  quantum leappad and my first leappad platforms and our leapster learning system are below expected sales or if sales of their related interactive books do not grow as we anticipate  sales of our other products may not be able to compensate for these shortfalls and our overall sales would suffer 
if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors  our sales and market share could decline 
we currently compete primarily in the infant and toddler category  preschool category and electronic learning aids category of the us toy industry and  to some degree  in the overall us and international toy industry 
our schoolhouse division competes in the us supplemental educational materials market 
each of these markets is very competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future 
for example  mattel  inc sells under its fisher price brand products called powertouch having functionality similar to that of our leappad and littletouch leappad platforms 
also  vtech holdings ltd 
and mattel under its fisher price brand sell  v 
smile and interactv  respectively  which are television based learning products that allow for video game play similar to our leapster learning system 
we believe that we are beginning to compete  and will increasingly compete in the future  with makers of popular game platforms and smart mobile devices such as personal digital assistants 
for example  we are beginning to cross over into their markets with products such as our leapster handhelds  iquest handheld and planned products  such as our fly pentop computer 
these companies are well situated to compete effectively in our primary markets 
many of our direct  indirect and potential competitors have significantly longer operating histories  greater brand recognition and substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to changes in consumer requirements or preferences or to new or emerging technologies 
they may also devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we do 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively in our markets 
we rely on a limited number of manufacturers  virtually all of which are located in china  to produce our finished products  and our reputation and operating results could be harmed if they fail to produce quality products in a timely and cost effective manner and in sufficient quantities 
we outsource substantially all of our finished goods assembly manufacturing to asian manufacturers  most of who manufacture our products at facilities in the guangdong province in the southeastern region of china 
in  we initiated a supply chain management project to strengthen our finished goods production capabilities by expanding our operations in asia and formalizing relationships with our third party manufacturers 
we depend on these manufacturers to produce sufficient volumes of our finished products in a timely fashion and at satisfactory quality and cost levels 
we generally allow retailers and distributors to return or receive credit for defective or damaged products 
if our manufacturers fail to produce quality finished products on time  at expected cost targets and in sufficient quantities due to capital shortages  late payments from us  political instability  labor shortages  health epidemics  intellectual property disputes  changes in international 
table of contents economic policies  natural disasters  energy shortages  terrorism or other disruptions to their businesses  our reputation and operating results would suffer 
in addition  if our manufacturers decide to increase production for their other customers  they may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our finished products and our business could be harmed 
our business depends on three retailers that together accounted for approximately of our net sales in  and of the us consumer segment sales  and our dependence upon a small group of retailers may increase 
wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target accounted in the aggregate for approximately of our net sales in in  sales to wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales 
we expect that a small number of large retailers will continue to account for a significant majority of our sales and that our sales to these retailers may increase as a percentage of our total sales 
in addition  if any of these retailers experience significant financial difficulty in the future or otherwise fails to satisfy their accounts payable  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable could be insufficient 
for example  at december   wal mart including sam s club accounted for approximately of our accounts receivable  toys r us accounted for approximately of our accounts receivable and target accounted for approximately of our accounts receivable 
if any of these retailers reduce their purchases from us  change the terms on which we conduct business with them or experience a future downturn in their business  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we do not have long term agreements with our retailers and changes in our relationships with retailers could significantly harm our business and operating results 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our retailers 
as a result  agreements with respect to pricing  shelf space  cooperative advertising or special promotions  among other things  are subject to periodic negotiation with each retailer 
retailers make no binding long term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering one time purchase orders 
if the number of our products increases as we have planned or the roll out of versions of our learning center shelf displays in selected retail stores proceeds as we anticipate  we will require more retail shelf space to display our various products 
any retailer could reduce its overall purchases of our products  reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products  decide not to incorporate versions of our learning center shelf displays in its stores or otherwise materially change the terms of our current relationship at any time 
any such change could significantly harm our business and operating results 
our international consumer business may not succeed and our future operating results could be harmed by economic  political  regulatory and other risks associated with international sales and operations 
we have limited experience with sales operations outside the united states 
we began selling directly to retailers in canada in june  to retailers in france in july  and to retailers in mexico in september  and we entered the german speaking markets in europe through our distributor  stadlbauer marketing vertrieb gmbh  in fall we derived approximately of our net sales from outside the united states in  in  and in we intend to increase our international sales through additional overseas offices to develop further our direct sales efforts  distributor relationships and strategic relationships with companies with operations outside of the united states  such as benesse corporation in japan 
however  these and other efforts may not help increase sales of our products outside the united states 
our business is  and will increasingly be  subject to risks associated with conducting business internationally  including political and economic instability  military conflicts and civil unrest  existing and future governmental policies  greater difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  
table of contents complications in modifying our products for local markets or in complying with foreign laws  including consumer protection laws  competition laws and local language laws  transportation delays and interruptions  greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  different accounting practices and problems in collecting accounts receivable  and limitations  including taxes  on the repatriation of earnings 
any difficulty with our international operations could harm our future sales and operating results 
our future growth will depend in part on our education and training group  which may not be successful 
we launched our education and training group in june to deliver classroom instructional programs to the pre k through th grade school market and explore adult learning opportunities 
to date the schoolhouse division  which accounts for substantially all of the results of our education and training segment  has incurred cumulative operating losses 
sales from our schoolhouse division s curriculum based products will depend principally on broadening market acceptance of those products  which in turn depends on a number of factors  including our ability to demonstrate to teachers and other key educational institution decision makers the usefulness of our products to supplement traditional teaching practices  the willingness of teachers  administrators  parents and students to use products in a classroom setting from a company that may be perceived as a toy manufacturer  the effectiveness of our sales force  our ability to generate recurring revenue from existing customers through various marketing channels  and the availability of state and federal government funding to defray  subsidize or pay for the costs of our products which may be severely limited due to budget shortfalls currently faced by many states and the federal government  reappropriation by states and the federal government for natural disaster relief  and our ability to demonstrate that our products improve student achievement 
if we cannot continue to increase market acceptance of our schoolhouse division s supplemental educational products  the division may not be able to sustain its recent operating profits and our future sales could suffer 
as of december   the net unamortized balance of our capitalized content development costs relating to our schoolhouse division was million 
if the schoolhouse division does not continue to achieve operating profits  we may have to write off some or all of the balance of these costs  which could significantly harm our operating results 
third parties have claimed  and may claim in the future  that we are infringing their intellectual property rights  which may cause us to incur significant litigation or licensing expenses or to stop selling some or all of our products or using some of our trademarks 
in the course of our business  we periodically receive claims of infringement or otherwise become aware of potentially relevant patents  copyrights  trademarks or other intellectual property rights held by other parties 

table of contents upon receipt of this type of communication  we evaluate the validity and applicability of allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights to determine whether we must negotiate licenses or cross licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies or trademarks or other proprietary matters in or on our products 
any dispute or litigation regarding patents  copyrights  trademarks or other intellectual property rights  regardless of its outcome  may be costly and time consuming  and may divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
if we  our distributors or our manufacturers are adjudged to be infringing the intellectual property rights of any third party  we or they may be required to obtain a license to use those rights  which may not be obtainable on reasonable terms  if at all 
we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against the development and sale of some or all of our products or against the use of a trademark or copyright in the sale of some or all of our products 
our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all the liability that could be imposed 
we may presently be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our technology or products 
we will continue to be subject to infringement claims as we increase the number and type of products we offer  as the number of products  services and competitors in our markets grow  as we enter new markets and as our products receive more attention and publicity 
if we are not successful in defending these kinds of claims  it could require us to stop selling certain products and to pay damages 
our intellectual property rights may not prevent our competitors from using our technologies or similar technologies to develop competing products  which could weaken our competitive position and harm our operating results 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technologies that are used in our learning platforms and related software  such as our littletouch leappad  my first leappad  classic leappad  leappad plus writing  quantum leappad and leapster platforms  as well as our explorer and odyssey interactive globe series 
our proprietary technologies are also used in the products we are developing  such as our fly pentop computer and l max television based learning system  both of which are scheduled to launch in fall we rely  and plan to continue to rely  on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
the contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property or deter independent third party development of similar technologies 
for example  we are aware that products very similar to some of ours have been produced by others in china  and we are seeking to enforce our rights 
however  we may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights  if any  in china or other countries where such product may be manufactured or sold 
monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is costly  and any dispute or other litigation  regardless of outcome  may be costly and time consuming and may divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where we do not hold patents or trademarks or where the laws may not protect our intellectual property as fully as in the united states 
some of our products and product features have limited intellectual property protection  and  as a consequence  we may not have the legal right to prevent others from reverse engineering or otherwise copying and using these features in competitive products 
for additional discussion of litigation related to the protection of our intellectual property  see item legal proceedings 
leapfrog enterprises  inc v 
fisher price  inc 
and mattel  inc if we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully  our rights could be diminished and our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
we depend on our suppliers for our components and raw materials  and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available 
some of the components used to make our products  including our application specific integrated circuits  or asics  currently come from a single supplier 
additionally  the demand for some components such as liquid crystal displays  integrated circuits or other electronic components is volatile  which may lead to shortages 
we have recently experienced longer lead times for the purchase of electronic components such as liquid crystal 
table of contents display touch screens  asics and memory chips 
if our suppliers are unable to meet our demand for our components and raw materials and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price available from our current suppliers or an alternative source is prohibitive  our ability to maintain timely and cost effective production of our products would be seriously harmed and our operating results would suffer 
we do not have long term agreements with our major suppliers  and they may stop manufacturing our components at any time 
we presently order our products on a purchase order basis from our component suppliers  and we do not have long term manufacturing agreements with any of them 
the absence of long term agreements means that  with little or no notice  our suppliers could refuse to manufacture some or all of our components  reduce the number of units of a component that they will manufacture or change the terms under which they manufacture our components 
if our suppliers stop manufacturing our components  we may be unable to find alternative suppliers on a timely or cost effective basis  if at all  which would harm our operating results 
in addition  if any of our suppliers changes the terms under which they manufacture for us  our costs could increase and our profitability would suffer 
if we do not correctly anticipate demand for particular products  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays  which would reduce our gross margins or cause us to lose sales 
demand for our products depends on many factors such as consumer preferences  including children s preferences  and the introduction or adoption of new hardware platforms for interactive educational products and related content  and can be difficult to forecast 
demand for our products may remain stagnant or decrease 
we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand for specific products as we introduce and support additional products  enter additional markets and as competition in our markets intensifies 
if we misjudge the demand for our products  we could face the following problems in our operations  each of which could harm our operating results if our forecasts of demand are too high  we may accumulate excess inventories of components and finished products  which could lead to markdown allowances or write offs affecting some or all of such excess inventories 
we may also have to adjust the prices of our existing products to reduce such excess inventories 
for example  in inventory provisions of million were recorded for obsolete and defective inventory of raw materials and discontinued finished goods 
the increase in reserves was due  at least in part  to significantly lower sales in the fourth quarter versus expectations for products to be discontinued in if demand for our platform products are not accompanied by demand for related software products  our gross margins would suffer and our operating results would be adversely affected 
if demand for specific products increases beyond what we forecast  our suppliers and third party manufacturers may not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet the demand 
our failure to meet market demand would lead to missed opportunities to increase our base of users  damage our relationships with retailers and harm our business 
rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in increased manufacturing errors  as well as higher component  manufacturing and shipping costs  including increased air freight  all of which could reduce our profit margins and harm our relationships with retailers and consumers 
our products are shipped from china and any disruption of shipping could harm our business 
we rely on four contract ocean carriers to ship virtually all of the products that we import to our primary distribution centers in california through the long beach  california port 
retailers that take delivery of our products in china rely on a variety of carriers to import those products 
any disruption or slowdown of service 
table of contents on importation of products caused by health epidemic related issues  labor disputes  terrorism  international incidents  quarantines  lack of available shipping containers or otherwise could significantly harm our business and reputation 
for example  in  a key collective bargaining agreement between the pacific maritime association and the international longshore and warehouse union affecting shipping of products to the western united states  including our products  expired and  after a temporary extension  resulted in an eleven day cessation of work at west coast docks 
this cessation of work cost us approximately million in additional freight expenses 
in addition  in july  independent truck drivers went on strike causing slowdowns in container transport to and from ports across the united states 
although these disputes have been resolved  other disputes may arise or additional security measures may be enacted in regards to shipping and shipping containers  which may cause delays in the delivery of our products and significantly harm our business and reputation 
any errors or defects contained in our products  or our failure to comply with applicable safety standards  could result in delayed shipments or rejection of our products  damage to our reputation and expose us to regulatory or other legal action 
we have experienced  and in the future may experience  delays in releasing some models and versions of our products due to defects or errors in our products 
our products may contain errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun  which could result in the rejection of our products by our retailers  damage to our reputation  lost sales  diverted development resources and increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims  any of which could harm our business 
children could sustain injuries from our products  and we may be subject to claims or lawsuits resulting from such injuries 
there is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed  or fall outside the scope of  our insurance coverage 
moreover  we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future 
we are subject to the federal hazardous substances act  the flammable fabrics act  regulation by the consumer product safety commission  or cpsc  and other similar federal and state rules and regulatory authorities 
our products could be subject to involuntary recalls and other actions by such authorities 
concerns about potential liability may lead us to recall voluntarily selected products 
for example  in december  the cpsc announced our voluntary repair program for the approximately  units of our alphabet pal product sold prior to that date 
we had instituted the repair proceedings with the cpsc because we were concerned that the product could cause injury 
our costs in connection with the repair were approximately million 
any recalls or post manufacture repairs of our products could harm our reputation  increase our costs or reduce our net sales 
outbreaks of health epidemics  such as severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  and the so called asian bird flu may adversely impact our business or the operations of our contract manufacturers or our suppliers 
in the past  outbreaks of sars have been significantly focused on asia  particularly in hong kong  where we have an office  and in the guangdong province of china  where almost all of our finished goods manufacturers are located 
in addition  recent outbreaks of avian influenza  or asian bird flu  have occurred throughout asia  including cases in guangdong province 
the design  development and manufacture of our products could suffer if a significant number of our employees or the employees of our manufacturers or their suppliers contract sars or asian bird flu or otherwise are unable to fulfill their responsibilities or quarantine or other disease mitigation measures disrupt operations 
in the event of any significant outbreak  quarantine or other disruption  we may be unable to quickly identify or secure alternate suppliers or manufacturing facilities and our results of operations would be adversely affected 
earthquakes or other events outside of our control may damage our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend 
our us distribution centers  including our new distribution center in fontana  california  our los gatos  california engineering office and our corporate headquarters are located in california near major earthquake faults 
table of contents that have experienced earthquakes in the past 
an earthquake or other natural disasters could disrupt our operations 
additionally  the loss of electric power  such as the temporary loss of power caused by power shortages in the grid servicing our facilities in california  could disrupt operations or impair critical systems 
any of these disruptions or other events outside of our control could impair our distribution of products  damage inventory  interrupt critical functions or otherwise affect our business negatively  harming our operating results 
our existing earthquake insurance relating to our distribution center may be insufficient and does not cover any of our other operations 
if the facilities of our third party finished goods or component manufacturers are affected by earthquakes  power shortages  floods  monsoons  terrorism or other events outside of our control  our business could suffer 
we are subject to international  federal  state and local laws and regulations that could impose additional costs on the conduct of our business 
in addition to being subject to regulation by the cpsc and similar state regulatory authorities  we must also comply with other laws and regulations 
the children s online privacy protection act  as implemented  requires us to obtain verifiable  informed parental consent before we collect  use or disclose personal information from children under the age of additionally  the robinson patman act requires us to offer non discriminatory pricing to similarly situated customers and to offer any promotional allowances and services to competing retailers and distributors within their respective classes of trade on proportionally equal terms 
our schoolhouse division is affected by a number of laws and regulations regarding education and government funding 
we are subject to other various laws  including international and us immigration laws  wage and hour laws and laws regarding the classification of workers  as well as corporate governance laws and regulations  such as the sarbanes oxley act of compliance with these and other laws and regulations impose additional costs on the conduct of our business  and failure to comply with these and other laws and regulations or changes in these and other laws and regulations may impose additional costs on the conduct of our business 
one stockholder controls a majority of our voting power as well as the composition of our board of directors 
holders of our class a common stock will not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote 
our class a common stock entitles its holders to one vote per share  and our class b common stock entitles its holders to ten votes per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
as of december   lawrence j 
ellison and entities controlled by him beneficially owned approximately million shares of our class b common stock  which represents approximately of the combined voting power of our class a common stock and class b common stock 
as a result  mr 
ellison controls all stockholder voting power  including with respect to the composition of our board of directors and  through it  any determination with respect to our business direction and policies  including the appointment and removal of officers  any determinations with respect to mergers  other business combinations  or changes in control  our acquisition or disposition of assets  our financing activities  and the payment of dividends on our capital stock  subject to the limitations imposed by our credit facility 
this control by mr 
ellison could depress the market price of our class a common stock or delay or prevent a change in control of leapfrog 
the limited voting rights of our class a common stock could negatively affect its attractiveness to investors and its liquidity and  as a result  its market value 
the holders of our class a and class b common stock generally have identical rights  except that holders of our class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of our class b common stock are 
table of contents entitled to ten votes per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders 
the holders of our class b common stock have various additional voting rights  including the right to approve the issuance of any additional shares of class b common stock and any amendment of our certificate of incorporation that adversely affects the rights of our class b common stock 
the difference in the voting rights of our class a common stock and class b common stock could diminish the value of our class a common stock to the extent that investors or any potential future purchasers of our class a common stock attribute value to the superior voting or other rights of our class b common stock 
provisions in our charter documents  delaware law and our credit facility agreement may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company  which could decrease the value of our class a common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent and the voting power associated with our class b common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used by our board of directors to effect a rights plan or poison pill that could dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer and may have the effect of delaying  discouraging or preventing an acquisition of our company 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding voting stock 
although we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
in addition  under the terms of our credit agreement for our unsecured senior credit facility  we may need to seek the written consent of the bank issuing the credit facility if the acquisition of our company does not meet one of the enumerated exceptions set forth in the credit agreement 
obtaining the bank s written consent may delay an acquisition of our company 
our stockholders may experience significant additional dilution upon the exercise of options or issuance of stock awards 
as of december  there were outstanding under our equity incentive plans options to purchase a total of approximately million shares of class a common stock 
contemporaneous with our july initial public offering  we registered approximately million shares of class a common stock issuable under our equity incentive plans  which include the shares issuable upon exercise of all of our options outstanding as of the date of our initial public offering as well as options to be granted in the future 
in addition  in june our stockholders approved an amendment to our equity incentive plan that increased the number of shares of our class a common stock available for issuance under the plan by  shares and to implement a performance based stock award program 
to the extent we issue shares upon the exercise of any of options  performance based stock award grants or pursuant to other equity incentive awards issued under our equity incentive plan  investors in our class a common stock will experience additional dilution
