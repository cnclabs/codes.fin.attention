in february  the company purchased a acre facility consisting of  square feet of manufacturing and office building space in commerce city  colorado 
the company has since expended significant resources to refurbish the facility to house its colorado operations 
the facility is also located within an enterprise zone  which continues to provide additional benefits 
the company leases a portion of this facility s excess office and yard space on a long term and short term basis at  per month 
effective april   the company merged with rotocast international  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries rotocast  with the company being the surviving entity 
in accordance with the merger agreement  the company issued  shares of its common stock and a  note payable secured by a stand by letter of credit  in exchange for all the outstanding voting stock of rotocast 
in january  the company repurchased these shares for million 
upon consummation of the repurchase  the shares were retired 
rotocast had operations in miami  florida  knoxville  tennessee  brownwood  texas  las vegas  nevada  and bossier city  louisiana 
these operations currently conduct business as divisions of the company using the trade names nutron  rotocast of tennessee  rmi b and rmi nevada 
prior to the merger  the operations in bossier city  louisiana were substantially discontinued 
rotocast was a privately held florida corporation  owned by gsc industries  inc gsc 
the company leases the remaining rotocast facilities from gsc  and other affiliated parties  under long term lease arrangements 
a portion of the nutron office building is being sub leased on a long term basis at  per month 
in conjunction with the rotocast merger  the company initiated the consolidation of its warminster  pennsylvania and arleta  california facilities into its remaining operations 
the consolidation of these facilities was completed in fiscal and enhanced the operations of the company s remaining facilities  reduced its overall manufacturing overhead costs  and allowed the company to take greater advantage of its marketing and distribution channels 
also  in fiscal  the company consolidated its miami operations into the remaining operating facilities 
the miami facility building is being sub leased on a long term basis at  per month 
the corporate office of the company is located at the same site as the rmi g gardena  california facility 
description of business the company currently has ten manufacturing locations and was again listed by a plastics industry periodical as one of the top ten rotational molders in north america 
these operating divisions manufacture a variety of plastic products for commercial  agricultural  pharmaceutical  governmental  building  medical waste  refuse  retail  recreation  marine  healthcare and residential use  as well as a vast number of custom plastic products for a variety of industries  utilizing the rotonically molding process and  on a smaller scale  injection molding and dip molding processes 
in april  the injection molding process was added to the company s manufacturing operations as part of the rotocast merger 
utilizing this process  the company markets a variety of parts for commercial  promotional  and residential uses  under the trade names nutron and amp 
rotonically molding is a process for molding plastic resin by rotating a mold in a heated environment  while the plastic resin powder placed inside the mold melts and evenly coats the inner wall of the mold 
the injection molding process varies in that the plastic resin is first heated to a molten state and then injected under pressure into a mold 
the rotonically molding process has been used for many years and continues to be recognized as a growth industry in recent years  as a result of numerous ongoing business consolidations and the development of new resins 
these new resins allow rotonically molded items to compete with more traditional materials such as carbon  fiberglass  and stainless steel  especially in the fabrication of large  lightweight  one piece molded items  such as storage tanks and polysteel light poles 
rotonically molding is a particularly advantageous process for users of molded plastic products who may want to test different prototypes  or who do not require sufficient numbers of such products to justify a more expensive manufacturing process 
the company s products include various types of storage tanks  bin lids  refuse containers for automated removal  medical waste containers  agricultural livestock products  kayaks  outdoor polysteel lamp posts  furniture  planters  and other rotonically molded items 
the company purchases resin from eight major suppliers in the us and canada 
there are seventeen additional suppliers of lesser significance 
since the majority of the resin used in the manufacturing process is a polyethylene derived from natural gas  resin price is not directly related to the price for petrochemicals  and until recent years  has not generally been subject to volatile fluctuations that are often experienced by the petroleum industry 
the company also incorporates the use of recycled plastic materials  blended with virgin materials in the manufacturing of products  whenever appropriate 
the company holds several patents on storage containers used for pharmaceutical  commercial and residential applications that expire through the year although the company has been able to capture its share of these niche markets and expects to see continued growth  no one patent or groups of patents is considered material to the business as a whole 
competition for the company s products is governed by geography and region  since large capacity tanks and bulky hollow products are expensive to ship long distances and  as such  any prospective competitor is constrained by shipping costs 
there are numerous single location  as well as a growing trend to structure multi location  rotonically molding businesses throughout the united states 
however  each of these businesses still competes in a geographic region  which is determined by customer demand within that region  a constraint inherent to the industry 
due to its nationwide presence  the company has substantially alleviated this constraint 
the company s sales are usually not subject to large seasonal fluctuations as the business typically operates on significant backlogs with a diverse product mix 
peak season is usually experienced in the period from april through june 
historically  the quarter from january through march is the slowest production period of the year 
the company s backlog was  and  as of june  and  respectively 
all of the backlog orders as of june  are expected to be filled during fiscal the company s products are marketed through the in house sales and engineering staff  various distributors and outside commission based sales representatives 
the company continues to build a strong  broad and diverse customer base  which covers a multitude of industries 
since fiscal  no sales to any one single customer represented a material part of the company s business 
research and development expenditures for the company were insignificant for the last three fiscal years 
regulation the company believes it is in compliance with all applicable federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment  and does not anticipate any such laws will have material effect on its financial position  capital expenditures  or competitive position

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction to the extent that this k annual report discusses matters which are not historical  including statements regarding future financial results  information  or expectation about products or markets  or otherwise makes statements about future events  such statements are forward looking and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made 
these include  among others  fluctuations in costs of raw materials and other expenses  costs associated with plant closures  downturns in the markets served by the company  the costs associated with new product introductions  as well as other factors described under the heading item  business  item  legal proceedings  under this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and footnote to financial statements 
when used in this report  the words expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward looking statements 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect our opinion only as of the date of the annual report 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward looking statements after the date of this document 
you should carefully review the risk factors described in other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission  including the quarterly reports on form q to be filed by us in fiscal operations net sales improved by to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal all of our major product groups contributed to the notable million increase in our net sales during fiscal as we look back at fiscal  we would like to acknowledge that a significant contribution to this growth was attributed to our efforts to bring new product offerings to the marketplace as well as modify existing product line offerings to better serve our customers 
as a result  our industrial product group  led by tank  material handling and linen laundry products increased by  marine  which includes our rivers waterways line  increased by  and refuse  led by medical waste products  increased by 
our net sales also benefited from an increase in contract manufacturing sales 
we continue to realize a consistent flow of products in this group  which included an impressive array of outdoor spas in fiscal we remain optimistic about the outlook for fiscal and believe that the recent tragic events that have occurred in our gulf coast also bring hope of more jobs  business opportunities and a stronger nation 
to date  our backlog levels are higher than they were this time last year  which combined with our investments in new energy efficient machinery and tooling and our efforts to expand our marketing channels will continue to benefit future periods 
in fiscal  net sales improved by to  compared to  in fiscal during fiscal  the majority of our product groups reflected improvements with the most notable being a increase in refuse products  a increase in contract manufacturing products and a increase in industrial products 
we believe a key component to our sales growth was the  spent on new equipment  tooling and improvements that fulfilled our commitment to increase our sales  improve productivity and continue to improve the quality of our product offerings 
cost of goods sold was  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to  and  or and of net sales  in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in our net sales along with our manufacturing efficiencies and systematic price increases have been instrumental in mitigating the overall increase in our cost of goods sold 
our largest hurdle in fiscal was combating rising raw material and natural gas costs 
since the material we use in our manufacturing process is derived from natural gas  the correlation between the two continues to impact our operations 
to put this in perspective  resin prices increased a minimum of in fiscal  or roughly as a percentage of net sales  so in retrospect we are extremely pleased with our efforts to minimize the impact to our operating results 
with the recent disaster in our gulf coast region coupled with sales of resin to foreign countries  we anticipate these costs to continue to escalate in the ensuing months 
as such  we will continue to implement strategies to minimize their potential impact to future operating results 
selling general and administrative sg a expenses were  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to  and  or and of net sales  in fiscal and  respectively 
although overall costs increased  in fiscal  we noted a drop in sg a costs as a percentage of net sales 
we were pleased with this correlation as it again confirms our efforts to maintain sg a levels in line with our revenue growth 
the fiscal increase in sg a costs of  is primarily linked to increased wage costs associated with our sales marketing and cost efficiency efforts 
we believe the benefits obtained as seen in the increase in our net sales and operating efficiencies has more than justified any minimal increase in our overall sg a costs 
the  decrease in sg a costs between fiscal and is primarily attributed to the  one time administrative contractual charge that was incurred in fiscal income from operations was  or of net sales  in fiscal year compared to  and  or and of net sales  in fiscal and  respectively 
we are pleased that we continue to post year on year improvements to our operating results in spite of the challenges to offset rising raw material and utility costs as previously mentioned 
fiscal operating results also benefited from overall reductions in our insurance costs  which had previously impacted prior year results  as well as our efforts to keep sg a costs in check with the increase in our net sales 
because of the uncertainties surrounding our nation s recent disaster  we fully anticipate raw material and natural gas costs will continue to rise in the near term 
if the general health of the economy remains positive  it is our hope that we can keep pace with these cost escalations by continuing to institute price increases and from the savings obtained from our recently installed energy efficient equipment 
total interest expense decreased  to  in fiscal  compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
although our debt level is down million in comparison to amounts outstanding at the end of fiscal  any potential savings in interest costs for borrowings not covered under our interest rate swap agreement have been diminished by an increase in the bank s prime interest rate of over the last twelve months 
the converse was true in fiscal  which benefited from historically lower interest rates coupled with a more favorable debt structure as compared to fiscal because of our interest rate swap agreement  which matures in august  we do not foresee any significant increases in future interest costs even if additional rate hikes are instituted 
income taxes were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the majority of our income tax provision relates to current taxes due and is consistent with the respective level of taxable income between the periods 
net income increased  to  or 
per common share  for fiscal compared to  or 
per common share  in fiscal the increase in our net sales in fiscal continued to play a pivotal role in boosting our net income by 
the increased revenues provided a stronger base to cover our fixed operating and sg a costs and helped mitigate the ongoing volatility we have experienced in raw material and utility costs 
secondarily  we will continue to benefit from our existing as well as future installations of energy efficient equipment that continue to improve our operating efficiencies 
although the recent events that have stricken our great nation have temporarily clouded future market conditions  as a leader in our industry we will strive to take advantage of all opportunities as they present themselves 
net income increased  to  or 
per common share  for fiscal compared to  or 
per common share  in fiscal the second half of fiscal offered a renewed vigor in the marketplace  that coupled with our efforts to improve sales volumes through enhanced product offerings and productivity resulted in our increase in fiscal sales volumes 
the significant increase in sales volumes provided the needed base to mitigate the rising raw material  utility and insurance costs that challenged our operations  along with the  fiscal inventory write down 
we successfully recouped a portion of these costs  which coupled with the reduction in sg a and interest costs provided the increase in current years net income 
liquidity and capital resources working capital increased  to  at june   compared to  at june  working capital benefited from the  increase in our net income  the  in proceeds received from the sale of our wisconsin property  collection of note receivable payments and distributions from our partnership investment 
these influxes of capital were used to purchase resin  pay our 
common stock dividend and pay down our bank line of credit 
cash flows from operations increased  to  in fiscal compared to  for the same period last year 
the increase again is primarily related to the  increase in our net income and cash flows obtained from accounts receivable reductions that were offset by a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in inventories that is consistent with current production requirements and to take advantage of preferred resin pricing 
we expended  for property  plant and equipment pp e in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal during fiscal  we placed into service three new energy efficient rotational molding machines at a combined cost of  with the balance of our expenditures primarily going to new tooling and various tooling and machinery enhancement projects 
these expenditures continue to mirror our commitment to allocate funding for capital expenditure projects that have provided us with the foundation to improve our operating efficiencies and promote increased sales revenues 
we anticipate capital expenditures to total between million in fiscal  which currently includes the installation of one new energy efficient rotational molding machine 
net borrowings under the line of credit decreased  to  between june  and june  the decrease is due to cash flows obtained from the increase in our net income and overall reductions in outstanding accounts receivable balances 
in addition  since june   our total debt borrowings have also declined by  we anticipate that this trend will continue through fiscal at june   we had  available for future borrowings under the line of credit 
effective october   the bank extended the maturity date on the line of credit to october  in addition  the maturity date for the letter of credit subfeature of our credit facility was extended to february  all other terms and conditions surrounding our credit facility with the bank remained the same 
the following is a summary of the company s contractual commitments associated with its debt and lease obligations as of june  for the year ended june  thereafter total principal payments term debt line of credit operating leases total commitments in fiscal  we acquired  shares of common stock at a total cost of  which completed our buyback program 
in june  the board of directors approved a new buyback program to acquire up to  of the company s common stock 
this buyback program does not have an expiration date 
at june   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
on june   the board declared a dividend of 
per share of common stock payable on july  to stockholders of record on july  this marks the ninth payment of dividends since on our common stock 
the board is committed to annually review a dividend program for our common stock 
cash flows from operations in conjunction with our revolving line of credit are expected to meet our needs for working capital  capital expenditures  common stock repurchases and repayment of long term debt for the foreseeable future

sfas no 
will become effective for the company as of the first interim period that begins after june  the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company has no off balance sheet arrangements or significant guarantees to third parties not fully recorded in our balance sheets or fully disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s significant contractual obligations include our debt agreements and lease commitments 
certain financial and operating restrictions under these agreements are fully disclosed in notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following accounts receivable we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are based on a percentage of net sales and a specific review of all significant outstanding receivable balances 
percentages applied may vary based on analysis of historical collection experience or current economic trends 
if the data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the results of operations could be affected 
inventory valuation finished goods inventory is valued at cost and management uses historical gross margin trends and other estimates to continually update labor and overhead allocations 
the gross margin percentage reflects our estimate of the cost of  among other things  material  labor and overhead expenditures during the production process 
such costs are capitalized to inventory as products are manufactured 
although it is believed that the estimates are reasonable  it is possible that the actual labor and overhead costs will differ over time from the estimated amounts 
due to the high volume of transactions and the way raw materials are used in product manufacturing  inventory quantities can change rapidly and are impacted by a variety of factors including  production efficiency  obsolescence  scrap  design changes  customer preferences  etc 
as such  the company must regularly count inventories to ensure they are up to date 
the company takes a physical count monthly and reconciles the count to the inventory 
however  given the number of transactions  the number of locations and the large number of inventory items  adjustments to the counts do occur on a regular basis 
although we believe that our inventory counts and values are reasonable the inventory does have some inherit estimates that could impact our balance sheet and results of operations 
impairments of long lived assets in accordance with the methodology described in fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
no impairments were recorded in the financial statements included in this form k 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized from the sale of our products upon shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss transfer to the customer when the product leaves the company s facility 
income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  income taxes are recorded based on the current amounts payable or refundable  as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes 
we base our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and in certain cases expectations about future outcomes 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in accounting estimates 
our net operating loss carryforwards  which are available to offset taxable income  are also subject to limitations should a change in ownership as defined in the internal revenue code occur 
although management believes that its estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in particular  we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realized 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income for the period in which such determination is made 
factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock we operate in a rapidly changing economic environment that presents numerous risks 
many of these risks are beyond our control and are driven by factors that we cannot predict 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
economic  political and market conditions can adversely affect our revenue growth 
our revenue growth and profitability depends on the overall demand for plastic products for commercial  recreational and residential uses 
because our sales are primarily to corporate and government customers  our business depends on general economic and business conditions 
in the past  the general weakening of the global economy  the weakening of business conditions in the manufacturing industry  and governmental budgetary constraints have resulted in a decreased demand for our products 
if demand for our products weakens again  our revenue growth rates will be adversely affected 
in addition  our country s war on terrorism  the recent natural disaster that hit our gulf coast  as well as federal and state budgetary concerns  have contributed to economic  political and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our revenue growth and results of operations 
if economic and market conditions do not remain healthy  our business will be adversely affected 
management has no comparative advantage in forecasting macroeconomic trends and developments relating to general business conditions 
our management is  however  required to make such forecasts in order to develop budgets  plan research and development strategies and perform a wide variety of general management functions 
to the extent that our forecasts are in error  because we are either overly optimistic or overly pessimistic about the performance of an economy or of a sector  our performance can suffer because of a failure properly to match corporate strategy with economic conditions 
if we do not successfully manage our operating margins  our business can be negatively impacted 
our future operating results will depend on our ability to forecast revenues accurately and control expenses 
while we can control certain internal factors  our future operating results can be adversely impacted by external factors  such as a slowing in demand for certain of our products 
if there is an unexpected decline in revenues  which is not offset by a decrease in expenses  our business and operating results will be adversely affected 
we may be required to change our business practices if there are changes in accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies 
policies  guidelines and interpretations related to revenue recognition  income taxes  facilities consolidation  accounting for acquisitions  allowances for doubtful accounts and other financial reporting matters require difficult judgments as to complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
some of these matters are also among topics currently under re examination by accounting standards groups and regulators 
these standard groups and regulators could promulgate interpretations and guidance that could result in material and potentially adverse  changes to our accounting policies 
business disruptions could affect our future operating results 
our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake  fire or other catastrophic event  such as terrorist attacks upon the united states 
our corporate headquarters  a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in california  near major earthquake faults 
a catastrophic event that results in the destruction of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be adversely affected 
in  california experienced ongoing power shortages  which resulted in rolling blackouts 
these blackouts  blackouts in other regions or procedures implemented to avert blackouts could cause disruptions to our operations and the operations of our customers 
such disruptions  particularly at the end of a quarter  could adversely affect quarterly revenues and net income 
our stock price could remain volatile and your investment could lose value

primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates and libor rates  which in turn affect the bank s prime and libor option rates
