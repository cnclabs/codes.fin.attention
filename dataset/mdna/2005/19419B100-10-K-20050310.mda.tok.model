overview collagenex pharmaceuticals  inc and subsidiaries 
is a specialty pharmaceutical company currently focused on developing and marketing innovative proprietary medical therapies to the dental and dermatology markets 
we currently market four pharmaceutical products to the dental market through our professional dental sales force  and we market one prescription product to the dermatology market through our professional dermatology sales force 
our dental products all treat periodontal disease and include periostat  atridox  atrisorb freeflow and atrisorb d the atrix products 
we developed and launched periostat in late and licensed the atrix products from atrix laboratories  inc now known as qlt usa  inc in august our marketed dermatology product is pandel  a prescription corticosteroid we licensed from altana  inc in may we also sell a branded version of periostat to united research laboratories  inc mutual pharmaceutical company  inc 
mutual pursuant to a license and supply agreement with mutual executed in april as part of a settlement of outstanding patent litigation 
mutual distributes this product through the major us drug wholesalers 
in addition to our marketed products  we have a pipeline of products in clinical and pre clinical development 
these products are based on our two proprietary platform technologies  impacs tm and restoraderm tm 
impacs inhibitors of multiple proteases and cytokines are a group of compounds that demonstrate a range of anti inflammatory activities as well as the ability to inhibit the breakdown of connective tissue 
periostat is our first fda approved impacs product 
periostat mr tm is a once a day  modified release formulation of periostat currently in a phase iii clinical trial for the treatment of adult periodontitis 
oracea tm  which has the same active ingredient and modified delivery as periostat mr  is in two phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of rosacea  a dermatological condition 
col  a second generation impacs compound  has completed phase ii trials for the treatment of hiv related kaposi s sarcoma and is currently in a phase ii proof of concept clinical trial for the treatment of rosacea 
our restoraderm technology is a proprietary  foam based  topical drug delivery technology that originated from a swedish collaborator 
we have acquired all right  title and interest to the restoraderm technology and are committed to initiate the development of five products based on this technology before the end of we are currently developing restoraderm products for the treatment of acne and psoriasis 
our strategy is to become a leading  research and development based specialty pharmaceutical company 
we intend to continue to market our current products and develop and launch new products based on our two proprietary platform technologies 
our current focus is on the dental and dermatology markets  although we intend to seek partnerships with third parties to develop potential uses of our technology outside of our core focus 
in april  we entered into a license and supply agreement as part of a settlement of all outstanding litigation with mutual relating to our patents for periostat 
in the settlement  mutual agreed and confessed to judgment that our periostat patents are valid and would be infringed by mutual s abbreviated new drug application anda for a generic form of periostat 
under the license and supply agreement mutual received a license to sell a branded version of periostat 
we will be the sole supplier of this product to mutual  subject to certain conditions 
the product will be sold to mutual at prices below our average manufacturer s price for periostat through may  or the earlier termination of such supply arrangements 
early termination may occur under certain circumstances  including the successful entry of a third party generic competitor to periostat 
we also agreed to provide price adjustment payments to mutual if a generic version of periostat becomes available on the market at a price lower than the selling price of mutual s branded version of periostat 
during  we made sales to mutual of approximately million 
we expect to earn gross 
table of contents margins in the range of to of net sales on all future sales of product to mutual  assuming the license and supply agreement is not terminated due to the entry of a third party generic competitor

during the year ended december   mutual s branded version of periostat accounted for approximately of the tablets dispensed to patients who received and filled a prescription for periostat 
contract revenues for the year ended december  decreased to  from approximately million during the year ended december   primarily due to the expiration and or mutual termination of our co promotion agreements with merck co  inc  novartis consumer health  inc and sirius laboratories  inc

preferred stock dividend preferred stock dividends included in net income loss allocable to common stockholders were million during each of the years ended december  and such preferred stock dividends were paid in shares of our common stock through may   and thereafter in cash  as a result of our obligations in connection with the issuance of our series d preferred stock in may liquidity and capital resources cash requirements sources and uses of cash we require cash to fund our operating expenses  capital expenditures and dividend payments on our outstanding series d preferred stock 
we have historically funded our cash requirements primarily through the following public offerings and private placements of our preferred and common stock  cash from operations  and exercise of stock options and warrants 
we believe that other key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash are the presence or absence of generic competition  which will be influenced by the outcome and consequences of our litigation with ivax pharmaceuticals inc and corepharma llc  the effect of our arrangement with mutual  including product payment terms and potential retroactive price adjustments  revenues and profits from sales of periostat  mutual s branded version of periostat and other products and contracted services  the success of our efforts to build a dermatology franchise  the success of our pre clinical  clinical and development programs  our ability to continue to meet the covenant requirements under our revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank  and the receptivity of the capital markets to our future financings 
on june   we entered into a loan modification agreement with silicon valley bank to renew and amend our revolving credit facility  which had expired on march  the amended credit facility expires on may  under the amended credit facility  we may borrow up to the lesser of million or of eligible accounts receivable  as defined under the amended credit facility 
the amount available to us is reduced by any outstanding letters of credit which may be issued under the amended credit facility in amounts totaling up to million

cash flows cash management investing activities during the year ended december  consisted primarily of the cash in flows from the sale of our uk and european dental assets to alliance  capital expenditures  purchase of in process research and development and the purchase of short term investments such as commercial paper and government notes 
financing activities provided  during the year ended december  the principal source of cash from financing activities was proceeds from employee stock option exercises  which were reduced by the payment of dividends to the holders of our series d preferred stock 
we currently believe that projected sales of our marketed products combined with our working capital at december   will be sufficient to fund our operations  capital expenditures and preferred stock dividend requirements for at least the next twelve months 
at this time  however  we cannot accurately predict the effect of certain developments on future product sales  such as our arrangement with mutual  the possibility of generic competition  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and the outcome of our research and development efforts to demonstrate the utility of periostat in indications beyond those already included in the fda approved label

such amount represents consulting payments to be made to brian m 
gallagher  our former chief executive officer and president  upon his separation from the company and pursuant to the terms of a consulting agreement executed march  on june   we executed a development and licensing agreement with shire laboratories  inc pursuant to which we were granted an exclusive worldwide license including the right to sublicense to use shire technology and patents to develop prescription products for the treatment of various inflammatory disorders 
under the agreement  certain product development functions will be performed for us by shire 
we have committed to pay shire milestone payments in cash or  at our option  in a combination of cash and our common stock  upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones 
these payments could total up to million in the aggregate 
under the agreement we must also pay shire a percentage of net sales of any products utilizing any part of the licensed technology 
we expect to make these payments in and if the outcome of our phase iii clinical trials for periostat mr and oracea is favorable 
we may terminate the agreement upon sixty days notice 
on august   we executed an asset purchase and product development agreement with respect to restoraderm technology the purchase agreement 
that agreement superseded our co operation  development and license agreement executed in february under the terms of the purchase agreement  we purchased all right  title and interest in the intellectual property and related rights to the restoraderm topical drug delivery system  which we intend to develop for dermatological applications 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  the purchase price of the assets shall be up to million  subject to the achievement of certain milestones 
we are also required to pay certain product development milestone payments in the aggregate amount of up to approximately million as well as royalty and sublicense fees upon product commercialization 
as of december   approximately  of these fees had been paid by us 
we paid an additional  in january critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements pertain to revenue recognition  stock compensation and deferred taxes  asset impairment and inventory obsolescence 
revenue recognition we recognize product sales revenue upon shipment  net of estimated returns  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
certain sales revenue from our customers  including mutual  is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return  rebates and price protection 
accordingly  we make provisions that reduce reported revenue for estimated future returns  rebates and price 
table of contents protection at the time the revenue is recorded 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns  inventory levels in the distribution channel and other related factors 
if a generic version of periostat  other than mutual s branded version  becomes available on the market these estimates made for the returns  rebates and price protection for periostat and mutual s branded version of periostat could vary materially from our current estimates and affect the results of operations  financial condition and our business in the period such generics become available on the market 
our contract revenues  which were substantially terminated by december   were fee based arrangements where revenue was earned as prescriptions were filled 
accordingly  since we never had title to the product being promoted  we had no significant obligations after we recognized this revenue 
since our inception  a portion of our revenue has been generated from license and distribution agreements for our products 
we recognize nonrefundable signing or license fees that are not dependent on future performance under these agreements as revenue when received or over the term of the arrangement if we have continuing performance obligations 
any amounts deferred are amortized to revenue over the expected performance period of each underlying agreement 
the expected performance period is based on management s best estimate and is subject to change based on current market conditions 
deferred revenue represents the portion of upfront license payments received that has not been earned 
milestone revenue from licensing arrangements is recognized upon completion of the milestone event or requirement if it represents the achievement of a significant step in the research  development or regulatory process 
stock based compensation it is our policy to apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations to account for our stock option grants rather than statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and related interpretations 
as such  compensation expense is recorded on fixed stock option grants only if the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option at the date of grant and is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
had we applied sfas no 
 which requires recording stock option grants at their fair value  our net income loss would have varied from the reported net income loss as we would have recorded additional expenses in each period 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the pro forma effect of applying sfas no 
to our results of operations and earnings per share allocable to common stockholders 
deferred taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment requires significant judgment and estimates 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider our history of losses  scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and projected future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax asset items are deductible 
the tax reform act of contains provisions that may limit the net operating loss nol and research and experimentation credit carryforwards available to be used in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interest 
while the company has been profitable for the past two years  uncertainty regarding patent litigation has prevented the company from reaching the more likely than not conclusion required under the applicable literature to recognize deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
acquired product rights with respect to our acquired product rights  we are required to test for asset impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we apply sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in order to determine whether or not an asset was impaired 
this standard requires an impairment analysis when indicators of impairment are present 

table of contents if such indicators are present  the standard indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows from the asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
in making future cash flow analyses of our acquired product rights  the company makes assumptions relating to the following the intended use of the product rights and the expected future cash flows resulting directly from such use 
generic competitor activities and regulatory initiatives that affect our dental and dermatology franchise 
customer preferences and expected managed care reimbursement 
we believe that an accounting estimate relating to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to change from time to time and the recognition of an impairment  as a result of the availability of a generic alternative  could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
inventory obsolescence we record an inventory obsolescence reserve for obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory 
in calculating our inventory obsolescence reserve  management analyzes historical data regarding customer demand for our product and generic alternatives if they should become available 
management believes that its accounting estimate related to inventory obsolescence for our current products could vary materially if a generic alternative becomes available for sale 
as such  the demand of our current products could become variable and changes in our reserve for inventory obsolescence could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions warrant  and changes to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed conditions require revision 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and supercedes apb opinion no 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan and liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas  no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r no later than our third quarter of fiscal under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r for all unvested stock options and restricted stock based upon the previously disclosed sfas methodology and amounts 
the retroactive methods would record compensation expense beginning with the first period restated for all unvested stock options and restricted stock 
we expect the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations and earnings per share 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and have not yet determined the method of adoption and we have not determined whether this adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas no
