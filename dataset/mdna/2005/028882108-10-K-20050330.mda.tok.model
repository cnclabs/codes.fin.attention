general we provide financial services  including brokerage and investment services to individuals and institutions  and insurance services  including management and agency services to medical malpractice insurance companies 
financial services 
we provide investment and investment advisory services to institutions and individuals throughout the united states through the following subsidiaries o aps financial 
aps financial is a fully licensed broker dealer that provides brokerage and investment services primarily to institutional and high net worth individual clients 
aps financial also provides portfolio accounting  analysis  and other services to insurance companies  banks and public funds 
we recognize commissions revenue  and the related compensation expense  on a trade date basis 
o asset management 
asset management manages fixed income and equity assets for institutional and individual clients on a fee basis 
we recognize fee revenues monthly based on the amount of funds under management 
insurance services 
through insurance services we provide management and agency services to medical malpractice insurance companies through the following subsidiary o fmi 
fmi provides management and administrative services to apie  a regional insurance exchange that sells medical professional liability insurance only to its physician subscribers  who pay annual insurance premiums and surplus contributions to apie 
apie is governed by a physician board of directors 
pursuant to a management agreement and the direction of this board  fmi manages and operates apie  including performing policy issuance  claims investigation and settlement  and all other management and operational functions 
as a management fee  fmi receives a percentage of apie s earned premiums and a portion of apie s profit  subject to a cap based on premium levels 
we recognize revenues for the management fee portion based on a percentage of earned premium on a monthly basis  and we recognize revenues for the management fee portion based on profit sharing when it is reasonably certain the managed company will have an annual profit  generally in the fourth quarter 
fmi s assets are not subject to apie policyholder claims 
in addition  as of december   we have the following significant investments accounted for as available for sale securities we own approximately  shares of healthtronics common stock  representing approximately of its outstanding common stock  we own  shares of financial industries corporation  representing approximately of its outstanding common stock 
our policy is to account for investments as available for sale securities 
this requires that we assess fluctuations in fair value and determine whether these fluctuations are temporary or other than temporary as defined in statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
temporary changes in fair value are recognized as unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholder s equity  net of income taxes 
should a decline in an investment be deemed other than temporary  as was the case with our investment in fic during the third and fourth quarters of  pretax charges to earnings will be taken in the period in which the impairment is considered to be other than temporary 
we also invested approximately  from surplus cash in low risk governmental and corporate fixed income securities 
these securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
as above  we would recognize an impairment charge to earnings in the event a decline in fair value below the cost basis of one of these investments is determined to be other than temporary 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to impairment of assets  bad debts  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we periodically review the carrying value of our assets to determine if events and circumstances exist indicating that assets might be impaired 
if facts and circumstances support this possibility of impairment  our management will prepare undiscounted and discounted cash flow projections  which require judgments that are both subjective and complex 
management may also obtain independent valuations 
our financial services revenues are composed primarily of commissions on securities trades 
revenues related to securities transactions are recognized on a trade date basis 
our insurance services revenues are primarily related to management fees based on the earned premiums of the managed company and include a profit sharing component  as defined in the management agreement  related to the managed company s annual earnings 
management fees are recorded  based upon the terms of the management agreement  in the period the related premiums are earned by the managed company 
the managed company recognizes premiums as earned ratably over the terms of the related policy 
the profit sharing component is recognized when it is reasonably certain the managed company will have an annual profit  and  typically  has been recognized during the fourth quarter 
when necessary  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowance may be required 
we have a limited number of customers with individually large amounts due at any given balance sheet date 
any unanticipated change in one of those customers credit could have a material affect on our results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
when necessary  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period the determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period the determination was made 
in we accounted for aps consulting as a variable interest entity under the guidance of fin consolidation of variable interest entities 
we had not recognized the divestiture of aps consulting and continued to consolidate the division as an entity in which we had a variable interest that would absorb the majority of the entity s operating losses should they have occurred 
effective november   aps consulting paid off the negotiated remainder of the note due us  allowing us to cease accounting for them as a variable interest entity 
consequently  we have reclassified the income statement and balance sheets to reflect the disposition of aps consulting as a discontinued operation 
we account for our equity and fixed income securities as available for sale 
in the event a decline in fair value of an investment occurs  management may be required to determine if the decline in market value is other than temporary 
management s assessments as to the nature of a decline in fair value are based on the quoted market prices at the end of a period  the length of time an investment s fair value has been in decline and our ability and intent to hold the investment 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  an appropriate write down is recorded against earnings 
results of operations overview and business outlook in  we saw substantial improvement in operating income from our insurance services segment compared to while revenues and operating income were down in our financial services segment in compared to  its financial results still proved to be the second best in its history 
as we look forward to  there are both opportunities and impediments to continued growth 
aps financial  the broker dealer division of our financial services segment  recorded a solid year in but fell short of the record year it enjoyed in both revenues and net profit in the market for investment grade fixed income securities was negatively impacted by low treasury rates while a rich high yield market led to low spreads for non investment grade securities  leading to lower demand for both products 
improving upon will depend upon a combination of more favorable bond market conditions as well as continued minimal loss of personnel and growth of clients 
non variable operating expenses will certainly be higher in as a result of sarbanes oxley compliance requirements despite the recent sec deferral of sox reporting for non accelerated filers until december for commission revenue generation  bullish  unstable markets provide us with the most opportunity 
conversely  stable  bearish markets pose the greatest difficulty in generating income 
uncertainty in world  political and economic events can also be an obstacle to revenue generation 
investors may take a wait and see attitude should uncertainty exist 
although we have been fortunate in retaining our key salespersons for many years  a loss of one or more key individuals and or a loss of one or more key accounts is possible and could have a material adverse effect upon earnings 
the nature of the broker dealer business and the current litigious legal environment in which we operate means that there is always the possibility of one or more lawsuits being brought against us 
claims against broker dealers generally rise in periods of down markets and the more prolonged a downturn  generally the greater risk of litigation 
aps insurance services enjoyed a record year in in both revenues and operating income 
total surplus at apie grew almost in compared to if apie s surplus continues to grow  this would continue to increase the financial strength of the company and its capacity to write new business and therefore increase the amount of profit in which we would be able to share 
for  we expect non variable operating expenses to remain consistent  with the exception of professional fees  which will be much higher as a result of sarbanes oxley compliance requirements 
the insurance segment is greatly affected by the profitability of the medical malpractice insurance company that we manage 
significant increases in claims brought against our insured doctors would negatively affect the profitability of apie  and consequently  the amount of profit  if any  we would be able to share in 
this risk has been reduced by lowering the limits of liability on the physicians apie insures coupled with providing policies that cap our overall exposure 
further  there was passage of tort and insurance reform in the state of texas in the new legislation capped non economic damages and placed restrictions on mass litigation 
as a result of tort reform  competitors have begun to re enter the state of texas  which could result in pressure to lower rates or a reduction in the number of insurance policies written by apie 
compared to revenues from operations increased  compared to our operating income increased  to  in compared to  in our net earnings decreased  in to a total of  compared to net earnings of  in our diluted earnings per share decreased to in compared to in the reasons for these changes are described below 
financial services our financial services revenues decreased  in compared to although commission revenues in were the second highest in aps financial s twenty three year history  they were down compared to  which saw record commission revenues at aps financial 
our broker dealer derives most of its revenue from trading in the fixed income market  both in investment and non investment grade securities 
revenue from both grade securities was lower 
investment grade markets are typically linked to treasury rates  which continued to trade in at a historically low yield levels 
customers have been cautious on committing funds  particularly to longer maturing instruments  thus negatively impacting trading revenues 
also  in the us high yield markets were almost universally considered over valued  trading at historically low spreads to treasuries 
again  this contributed to a reluctance of our customers to commit funds  and contributed to lower revenues 
our financial services expense decreased  in compared to the primary reason for the current year decrease is a  decrease in commission expense resulting from the decrease in commission revenue at aps financial mentioned above 
in addition  net profits before management incentive costs decreased at aps financial by  resulting in a  decrease in the current year formula driven incentive compensation costs 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in payroll costs of  in resulting from normal annual merit raises as well as the hiring of two new full time positions 
in addition  there were relatively minor current year increases in employee benefits  professional fees and information services 
insurance services our insurance services revenues from our premium based insurance management segment  aps insurance services  increased  in compared to one of the primary reasons for the current year growth is an increase of  in profits shared with apie 
the total amount of profit sharing recognized in was  all of which was recognized during the fourth quarter of  after profit sharing goals were attained 
in  we recognized all of that year s total of  in profit sharing during the fourth quarter as well 
as the certainty of profits at apie cannot be fully known until an end of year actuarial analysis by independent actuaries  we cannot predict what  if any  profits will be available to us until this analysis is complete 
another main reason for the growth in revenues in was a  increase in management fees resulting from greater insurance premium volumes 
earned premium increased at apie by in compared to primarily as a result of new business and strong retention of our existing business in the current year 
lastly  commission income increased  in compared to  resulting from approximately  in additional written premium in the current year 
as noted below  commissions paid to third party independent agents increased by an equivalent amount  resulting in no impact on net income 
insurance services expenses at our insurance management subsidiary increased  in compared to the current year increase is primarily due to the  increase in commissions paid to third party independent agents 
in addition  payroll expense increased  and formula driven incentive compensation expense increased  in compared to payroll expense was up in the current year due primarily to normal annual merit raises in addition to personnel additions made in the latter half of that were expensed the entire year in among the additions was a high level management position to help meet our growing financial reporting requirements 
the increase in formula driven incentive compensation cost was the result of an increase in segment operating profits 
excluding incentive compensation costs  pre tax profits at our insurance segment rose  
lastly  depreciation and amortization costs were  higher in compared to as a result of amortizing the non compete agreement that was created upon the repurchase of the minority interest in october  for a full year compared to only three months in partially offsetting these increases was a  decrease in advertising in compared to  a result of re branding efforts of the business performed in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased  in compared to the current year increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense which was  greater in on substantially higher operating income in the current year 
other professional fees were  higher in primarily as a result of fees incurred in connection with sarbanes oxley internal control procedures 
also  director s fees increased  as a result of a higher fee structure implemented in as well as an increased number of board and committee meetings compared to partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in legal fees of  in  the result of non recurring fees incurred in in connection with our investment in financial industries corporation  or fic 
gain on sale of assets gain on sale of assets primarily represents the recognition of deferred income 
approximately  of the  deferred gain on the sale of real estate to prime medical its name prior to the merger with healthtronics  inc in was due to our ownership interest in prime medical and is recognized upon the reduction of our ownership percentage in prime medical through the sale of its stock 
in  we recognized approximately  from the sale of a higher number of shares of prime medical common stock versus  when a gain of  was recorded 
gain on sale of investments gain on the sale of investment increased  in compared to as a result of gains from the sale of a greater number of available for sale equity securities sold in the current year 
loss from impairment of investment the current year loss was due to a write down of our investment in fic common stock 
during in accordance with sfas  we determined that the decline in market value of fic common stock was other than temporary and we recorded pretax charges to earnings totaling  these charges reduced our cost basis in fic from  or per share  to  or per share which is equal to the quoted market price of fic shares on december  we believe the decline in the market price of fic has been brought about by its failure to file its form k and its subsequent de listing from the nasdaq stock market 
we had expected fic to bring its filings current and pursue restoring its exchange listing but these events have not yet occurred 
while we currently continue to have the ability and the intent to hold the stock indefinitely  we have concluded that the additional uncertainty created by the late filings together with the lack of current financial information dictates that the decline should be viewed as other than temporary 
affiliates earnings loss our equity in the earnings of prime medical its name prior to the merger with healthtronics  inc was zero in as well as in as we no longer account for our investment in prime medical using the equity method of accounting  as was the case in the first quarter of when we recorded  in equity earnings 
as of march   we ceased accounting for our investment in prime medical using the equity method of accounting because on january   kenneth s 
shifrin  our chairman and ceo  stepped down from day to day operations as executive chairman of the board of prime medical  but continued to serve as non executive chairman 
mr 
shifrin further reduced his responsibilities on prime s board to vice chairman in  and from january to march   we sold  shares of prime medical common stock reducing our ownership percentage in to approximately 
our equity in earnings of uncommon care was zero in   in and a loss of  in because our total investment and advances to uncommon care has been reduced to zero  we suspended recording equity losses  as required under the equity method 
in  we advanced them  and recorded a loss for the full amount of the advance 
in  after informing uncommon care s management that we would make no further advances  we recorded equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in the amount of  related to cash received from uncommon care 
we expect no further receipts of cash from uncommon care and consequently expect to record no additional income in the future 
interest income our interest income increased  in compared to primarily as a result of a higher balance of interest bearing securities held in at december  we had a balance of  in fixed income securities versus a balance of  at december  other income loss our other income increased  in as a result of a write down taken in totaling  on an equity investment 
partially offsetting this was a decrease of  in administrative fee income from eco systems in resulting from their decreased earnings 
minority interests minority interests represents the combination of two outside interests in our subsidiaries a twenty percent interest in insurance services owned by fpic insurance group  inc and a three percent interest in aps asset management or apsam  a subsidiary within our financial services segment  owned by key individuals within aps asset management 
minority interests decreased in the current year due to the repurchase of the minority interest in insurance services from the minority interest holder  fpic insurance group  effective october  consequently  only nine months of minority interest was recorded in compared to a full year in during  minority interest was recorded only at apsam and amounted to just  discontinued operations effective november  aps consulting paid off the negotiated remaining amount of the note payable to us 
even though we had sold this segment to aps consulting s management exactly one year earlier  we continued to consolidate their revenues  expenses and balance sheet items because we were dependent upon future successful operations of the division to collect our proceeds from the disposal and we did not transfer risk of loss to discontinue reporting them on our consolidated financial statements 
with the payoff of the note  we recognized the divesture and now report aps consulting as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  has been reclassified to remove revenues and expenses from our consolidated statements of operations and after tax results of this former division are now recorded as income from discontinued operations in for  only the after tax gain on disposal of the segment is recorded as earnings from aps consulting 
there was no effect in cash flows for the year ended december  our cash provided by operations increased  compared to as a result of the increase in operating income at our insurance services segment 
cash used in investing activities increased  in compared to as a result of proceeds from the sale of available for sale equity securities during  which were much greater than those received in cash provided by financing activities decreased  in as a result of fewer options exercised compared to  a greater number of treasury stock shares purchased during and cash dividends paid in compared to revenues from operations increased  compared to our net income from continuing operations decreased  to  in from  in our net earnings decreased  in to a total of  compared to net earnings of  in our diluted earnings per share decreased to in compared to in the reasons for these changes are described below 
financial services our financial services revenues increased  in compared to the increase was due to strong commission revenues at aps financial 
aps financial derives most of its revenue from trading in the fixed income market  both in investment grade and non investment grade securities 
while revenue from investment grade transactions increased  revenue derived from the high yield market was particularly strong  as that sector performed particularly well throughout  as evidenced by various high yield indices rising as much as compared to also  we continued to have very low turnover in personnel  which gives us a better probability of maintaining our customer accounts 
our financial services expense increased  in compared to the primary reason for the year increases is a  increase in commission expense resulting from the increase in commission revenue at aps financial mentioned above 
in addition  net profits before management incentive costs increased at aps financial by  resulting in a  increase in the current year formula driven management incentive costs 
payroll related benefit costs were up  in as a result of a increase in health insurance costs as well as higher payroll taxes as a result of much higher earnings by commissioned brokers 
partially offsetting these increases were relatively minor current year decreases in ticket charges  information services  depreciation and advertising costs 
insurance services our insurance services revenues from our premium based insurance management segment  aps insurance services  increased  in compared to the primary reason for the increase was that we recognized profit sharing with apie in for the first time since the total amount of profit sharing recognized in was  all of which was recognized during the fourth quarter of  after profit sharing goals were attained 
as the certainty of profits at apie cannot be fully known until an end of year actuarial analysis by independent actuaries  we cannot predict what  if any  profits will be available to us until this analysis is complete 
further contributing to the increase in revenues was a  increase in management fees resulting from greater insurance premium volumes 
the increase in premiums was primarily the result of rate increases throughout and insurance services expenses at the insurance management subsidiary increased  in compared to the increase was primarily due to a  increase in payroll expense  a  increase in overhead allocation charged by the holding company  aps group  a  increase in management incentive expense  a  increase in employee benefits  and a  increase in advertising 
the increase in payroll was due primarily to the result of an industry salary analysis conducted in the latter half of  which resulted in wages within certain departments increasing to competitive levels in order to retain personnel 
in addition  two high level management positions were added in to expand our business development and to meet growing financial reporting requirements 
the increase in management incentive cost was the result of an increase in segment operating profits 
as was the case with our investment services segment  employee benefit costs rose in the current year as a result of an increase in health insurance costs 
lastly  advertising costs were higher in as a result of re branding efforts of the business 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased  in compared to the primary reason for the current year decrease was a  decrease in overhead allocated to aps insurance services 
in addition  other professional fees was  lower in as outside consulting fees were incurred in to ascertain the value of a certain investment 
partially offsetting these decreases was a  increase in management incentive expense resulting from substantially higher operating income in the current year 
legal fees were  higher in primarily as a result of fees incurred in connection with our investment in fic 
insurance expense was  higher in on increased directors and officers liability insurance premiums 
audit fees were  higher in as a result of new sec and accounting regulations implemented during the year 
gain on sale of assets gain on sale of assets primarily represents the recognition of deferred income 
approximately  of the  deferred gain on the sale of real estate to prime medical its title prior to the merger in was due to our ownership interest in prime medical and is recognized upon the reduction of our ownership percentage in healthtronics through the sale of its stock 
in  as a result of selling  shares of prime medical common stock  we recognized a proportionate percentage of the deferred gain  or about  during  we sold  shares of prime medical common stock and recognized a gain of  gain on sale of investments gain on the sale of investments decreased  in compared to the decline was due to the sale of significantly less shares of prime medical common stock in compared to in  we recorded gains on the sales of  shares compared to  shares sold in gains resulting from sales of prime medical common stock were  and  in and  respectively 
as a result of these sales  as of december   we owned approximately  shares of prime medical amounting to an ownership percentage of approximately 
in addition to the sale of prime medical shares we sold a number of fixed income securities in  which resulted in gains comprising the majority of the remaining income reported 
affiliates earnings loss our equity in the earnings of prime medical was zero in as we no longer accounted for our investment in prime medical using the equity method of accounting  as was the case in the first quarter of when we recorded  in equity earnings 
as of march   we ceased accounting for our investment in prime medical using the equity method of accounting because on january   kenneth s 
shifrin  our chairman and ceo  stepped down from day to day operations as executive chairman of the board of prime medical  but continued to serve as non executive chairman  and from january to march   we sold  shares of prime medical reducing our ownership percentage to approximately 
our equity in earnings of uncommon care increased to  in compared to a loss of  in because our total investment and advances to uncommon care has been reduced to zero we suspended recording equity losses  as required under the equity method 
in  we advanced them  and recorded a loss for the full amount of the advance 
in  after informing uncommon care s management that we would make no further advances  we recorded equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in the amount of  related to cash received from uncommon care 
we expect no further receipts of cash from uncommon care and consequently expect to record no additional income in the future 
interest income our interest income decreased  in compared to primarily as a result of a higher balance of interest bearing securities held in in june  we liquidated approximately million in interest bearing securities in order to secure the funds required to invest in  shares of fic common stock 
other loss our other loss decreased  in compared to the primary reason for the current year decrease in loss was the result of management fees received in from our former consulting division  which totaled  minority interests minority interests represents the combination of two outside interests in our subsidiaries a twenty percent interest in insurance services owned by fpic insurance group  inc and a three percent interest in aps asset management  a subsidiary within our financial services segment  owned by key individuals within aps asset management 
minority interests decreased in the current year due to the repurchase of the minority interest in insurance services from the minority interest holder  fpic insurance group  effective october  consequently  only nine months of minority interest was recorded in compared to a full year in discontinued operations effective november  aps consulting paid off the negotiated remaining amount of the note payable to us 
even though we had sold this segment to aps consulting s management exactly one year earlier  we continued to consolidate their revenues  expenses and balance sheet items because we were dependent upon future successful operations of the division to collect our proceeds from the disposal and we did not transfer risk of loss to discontinue reporting them on our consolidated financial statements 
with the payoff of the note we recognized the divesture and now report aps consulting as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  has been reclassified to remove revenues and expenses from our consolidated statements of operations and after tax results of this former division are now recorded as income from discontinued operations in for  only the after tax gain on disposal of the segment is recorded as earnings from aps consulting 
liquidity and capital resources working capital our net working capital was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the current year was due primarily to cash received from operations 
partially offsetting these increases to working capital in was an increase of  in accrued commissions payable at our broker dealer subsidiary resulting from increased commission earned in december compared to december historically  we have maintained a strong working capital position and  as a result  we have been able to satisfy our operational and capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from our operating and investing activities 
these same sources of funds have also allowed us to pursue investment and expansion opportunities consistent with our growth plans 
although there can be no assurance our operating activities will provide positive cash flow in  we are optimistic that our working capital requirements will be met for the foreseeable future for the following reasons our current cash position is very strong  with a balance of approximately million comprising of our total assets  our investments in available for sale equity and fixed income securities could provide an additional million should the need arise  and we renewed a line of credit in april that is described below 
line of credit during april  we renewed a million line of credit that was originally established in november with plainscapital bank 
the loan calls for interest payments only to be made on any amount drawn until april   when the entire amount of the note  principal and interest then remaining unpaid  shall be due and payable 
at december   there were no draws taken against this line of credit 
we are in compliance with the covenants of the loan agreement  including requirements for a minimum of million of unencumbered liquidity and a minimum to net worth ratio 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures for equipment were  and  in and  respectively 
our capital expenditures were higher in due to purchases necessary to upgrade our reporting software at our insurance services subsidiary 
at december   our reporting software upgrade is considered to be in progress with anticipated implementation in phases during and as the assets purchased during have not been placed in service  they are appropriately not being depreciated 
we expect capital expenditures in to be approximately  including another  in improvements to our business intelligence reporting software 
our capital expenditure budget is expected to be funded through cash on hand 
commitments there were no participation agreements or purchase commitments at december  we have committed cash outflow related to operating lease arrangements with a term exceeding one year at december  as follows in thousands payment due contractual cash obligations total operating leases  margin loans we extend credit to our customers  which is financed through our clearing organization  southwest securities  inc or southwest  to help facilitate customer securities transactions 
this credit  which earns interest income  is known as margin lending 
in margin transactions  the client pays a portion of the purchase price of securities  and we make a loan financed by our clearing organization to the client for the balance  collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client 
in permitting clients to purchase on margin  we are subject to the risk of a market decline  which could reduce the value of our collateral below the client s indebtedness 
agreements with margin account clients permit our clearing organization to liquidate our clients securities with or without prior notice in the event of an insufficient amount of margin collateral 
despite those agreements  our clearing organization may be unable to liquidate clients securities for various reasons including the fact that the pledged securities may not be actively traded  there is an undue concentration of certain securities pledged  or a trading halt is issued with regard to pledged securities 
if the value of the collateral were insufficient to repay the margin loan  a loss would occur  which we may be required to fund 
as of december   the total of all customer securities pledges on debit balances held in margin accounts was approximately million while the total value of the securities within these margin accounts was approximately million 
we are also exposed should southwest be unable to fulfill its obligations for securities transactions 
our ability to make scheduled payments or to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that we will realize anticipated revenue growth and operating improvements sufficient to make scheduled payments and fund planned future capital expenditures 
inflation our operations are not significantly affected by inflation because  having no manufacturing operations  we are not required to make large investments in fixed assets 
however  the rate of inflation will affect certain of our expenses  such as employee compensation and benefits 
impact of new accounting standards as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  on july   we are required to adopt several new accounting standards 
for a discussion of the impact of those new accounting standards upon us  see note n 
item a 
quanitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have exposure to changes in interest rates and the market values of our investments but have no material exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to both our investment portfolio and our revenues generated through commissions at our financial services segment 
all of our marketable fixed income securities are designated as available for sale and  accordingly  are presented at fair value on our balance sheets 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates could have an impact at our broker dealer subsidiary  aps financial 
the general level of interest rates may trend higher or lower in  and this move may impact our level of business in different fixed income sectors 
if a generally improving economy is the impetus behind higher rates  then while our investment grade business may drop off  our high yield business might improve with improving credit conditions 
a volatile interest rate environment in could also impact our business as this type of market condition can lead to investor uncertainty and their corresponding willingness to commit funds 
as we currently have no debt and do not anticipate the need to take on any debt in  interest rate changes will have no impact on our financial position as it pertains to interest expense 
investment risk as of december   our recorded basis in debt and equity securities was approximately million 
we regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that such declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary 
during  the value of one of our investments  fic  had declined significantly 
on october   we determined that this decline in market price was other than temporary as defined in statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
consequently  we recorded a pretax charge to earnings of  in the third quarter of the charge reduced our cost basis in fic from  or per share  to  or per share which was equal to the quoted market price of fic shares on september  we believe the decline in the market price of fic has been brought about by its failure to file its form k and its subsequent de listing from the nasdaq stock market 
we had expected fic to bring its filings current and pursue restoring its exchange listing by september  as of february  these events have still not occurred 
consequently  we have determined that we will continue to write this investment down to period end fair market value until such time as fic brings its public filings current 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded as additional pretax charge to earnings of  which further reduced our basis in fic to  or per share 
while we currently continue to have the ability and the intent to hold the stock indefinitely  we concluded that the additional uncertainty created by the late filings together with the lack of current financial information dictated that these declines should be viewed as other than temporary
