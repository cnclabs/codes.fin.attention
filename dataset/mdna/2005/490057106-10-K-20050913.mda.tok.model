overview revenues our revenues consist of three components net sales  research and development revenue and royalty income 
net sales 
net sales is comprised of sales of biomaterials products and the triactiv device 
biomaterials 
in the year of our ipo  fiscal  our biomaterials sales were comprised entirely of the absorbable collagen and polymer components of the angio seal supplied to our strategic alliance partner 
since that time  we have experienced significant sales growth in our biomaterials products as we have expanded our customer base and marketing activities  increased sales to existing customers and assisted customers in the development of new product offerings 
the biomaterials component of net sales  which comprises of total net sales  represents the sale of our biomaterials products to customers for use in the following markets orthopaedics sports medicine and spine  cardiology  drug biologics delivery  periodontal  general surgery and wound care 
the two most significant components of our biomaterials sales are our orthopaedic product sales and the absorbable components of the angio seal  supplied to st 
jude medical 
our orthopaedic product sales consist primarily of sales to arthrex  a privately held orthopaedics company for which we manufacture a wide array of sports medicine products and orthovita  a publicly held orthopaedic biomaterials company 
we began working with arthrex in fiscal and have since provided arthrex with many varied sports medicine products for commercial distribution 
during fiscal  we sold our first bone grafting and spine products to orthovita  vitoss foam strips and cylinders  and in fiscal  provided additional product lines for orthovita vitoss scaffold foam shapes and pack 
sales to orthovita increased from fiscal to fiscal below is a table showing the trends in our angio seal component and orthopaedic sales from fiscal to fiscal as a percentage of our total biomaterials sales percentage of total biomaterials sales product fiscal fiscal angio seal components orthopaedic products the increase in the angio seal components as a percentage of total biomaterials sales is related to the continued end user sales volume growth of the angio seal device 
the sales of the collagen plug component increased to million dollars for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to million in the fiscal year ended june  the absorbable polymer anchor component however  decreased to million for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to million in the fiscal year ended june   slightly offsetting the collagen plug sales increase 
this decline was the result of the ongoing transition of the manufacture of the absorbable polymer anchor to st 
jude medical and the prior year timing of certain increases in required volume depending on st 
jude medical capacity 
going forward  we anticipate consistency in the volume of anchor component supply as the supply level has been formalized under our new supply agreement with st 
jude medical  which was effective on june  under the new supply agreement  st 
jude medical is required to purchase of their collagen plug requirements and at least of their polymer anchor requirements from kensey nash 
the future of this portion of our biomaterials sales is dependent upon the continued success of the angio seal device in the vascular closure market 
today we estimate that the angio seal device has approximately of this market based on end user sales in excess of million in the fiscal year ended june  the angio seal market share may be impacted by future competition in this market or new technologies introduced to address diagnostic or therapeutic treatment of diseased coronary arteries 
the decrease in our orthopaedic products sales as a percentage of total biomaterials sales is primarily related to the decrease in sales to arthrex  which represented of total biomaterials sales for fiscal arthrex sales decreased million  or  from fiscal to fiscal as a result of an inventory over stocking issue that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal we believe arthrex has worked through this excess inventory throughout the course of our fiscal and expect growth in sales to arthrex in fiscal the fiscal decrease in sales to arthrex was partially offset by a million  or  increase in orthovita sales in our fiscal  the first full year of sales of the co developed vitoss foam products  over fiscal while orthovita s end user sales are strong and orthovita is forecasting growth in excess of for their calendar year  we anticipate our fiscal sales to orthovita will be down as much as from fiscal as orthovita works through inventory purchased in conjunction with previous product launches and restructures their ordering patterns associated with new product launches 
overall  with the combination of our new supply agreement with st 
jude medical  anticipated continued growth in angio seal end user sales  expected return to growth in the arthrex sports medicine product business and other new business opportunities  we expect growth in our overall biomaterials sales despite the forecasted decrease in our sales to orthovita 
we believe such growth will occur due to greater acceptance by the medical community of biomaterials and technological advances which have expanded the applications for our biomaterials products 
due to the greater market acceptance  we have been able to expand our biomaterials customer and product base by initiating new partnerships within the medical device industry  as well as expanding the product lines for our current customers 
triactiv system 
the triactiv system is a platform technology  offering not only our initial application for the protection from embolization during treatment of diseased saphenous vein grafts  but also future applications for the treatment of carotid artery disease and the removal of thrombus  amongst others 
embolic protection is a relatively new technology and is still subject to acceptance by the medical community  particularly for future applications 
we have created a new endovascular division responsible for direct sales and marketing in the us we are developing additional applications with the triactiv technology  including devices with and without embolic protection  as part of our direct marketing strategy 
we believe our direct strategy in the endovascular markets will allow us to maximize our return with our triactiv technology 
in the us  we launched the triactiv system after receiving fda clearance in march  through our newly formed direct sales force 
we will continue to build this sales team as required to address the market demands for the product and to service existing accounts 
in addition  we have a six person marketing team that supported the april product launch of the triactiv system and are presently working on promotion efforts related to our current triactiv device as well as preparing for upcoming launches of our new generations and applications of the triactiv system 
sales of the triactiv system in the us were  in our first quarter of commercial availability  the quarter ended june  we are forecasting sales growth for the triactiv product platform for fiscal based on greater acceptance of our svg product by the medical community  as well as the launch of a new generation svg product and additional applications in the second half of fiscal in europe  the triactiv system was commercially launched in may we are selling direct in germany and via distributors throughout the rest of europe and in india 
we have distributor agreements for sales in ireland  switzerland  austria  italy  the netherlands  and the united kingdom 
in addition  in april we initiated a distribution agreement in india  our first agreement in asia 
we are in the process of identifying distributors for additional markets in europe and asia 
we launched the second generation of the triactiv system  the triactiv fx embolic protection system the triactiv fx system  in april this second generation device incorporates several important ease of use design enhancements including an integrated  fully disposable flush and extraction system  a new balloon inflator that simplifies catheter exchanges during the procedure  and a monorail flush catheter to enhance device usage and reduce procedure time 
triactiv sales in europe were  for the fiscal year  a increase over the prior fiscal year 
while sales in europe increased over fiscal  european interventional procedures in svgs have been substantially lower than analysts or the company s estimates previously indicated 
this has resulted in lower than anticipated product sales for the triactiv svg application in europe 
however  we believe the launch of the triactiv fx system for svgs  offering improvements in ease of use  as well as future applications of the triactiv product platform  including carotid artery and thrombus removal applications  will improve the total sales of the triactiv system in the european community 
total triactiv system sales were approximately of our total sales for each of the fiscal years ended june  and we anticipate sales of the triactiv system will become a more significant component of net sales during fiscal and beyond as we increase our sales of the product in the us market  gain new customers in the european and asian markets and introduce new versions and applications of the product in both the u 
s and europe 
research and development revenue 
in fiscal  research and development revenue was derived from a three year million national institute of standards and technology nist grant received in october under this grant we were researching a synthetic vascular graft  also utilizing our ptm technology 
this project concluded in october in prior years  research and development revenue included additional revenue under additional grant programs 
in november  we received our first nist grant 
since that time we were also awarded a second nist grant and an nih grant 
under the first nist grant  a million grant over a three year period  we were researching cartilage regeneration utilizing our porous tissue matrix ptm technology 
although we continue to independently develop this technology  we received all remaining funds under this grant in our second quarter of fiscal in january  we received from the nih   over a one year period  under which we were researching sustained or controlled release of chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of breast cancer utilizing our ptm technology 
research under this grant was completed in early fiscal  but we are continuing to independently develop this drug delivery technology for commercial use and expectations of future grant applications 
we have no remaining grant revenue and do not project grant revenue in fiscal royalty income 
our royalty income primarily consists of royalties received from st 
jude medical and orthovita 
royalties from st 
jude medical are earned on angio seal worldwide net sales 
we anticipate sales of the angio seal device will grow in fiscal  with forecasted continued procedure growth and as st 
jude medical continues to expand its sales and marketing efforts and launch new generations of the product 
under our license agreement with st 
jude medical  there was a final contractual decrease in the royalty rate  to from  upon reaching four million cumulative units sold 
this final rate reduction occurred in april continued angio seal unit growth has partially offset this decline in royalty rate  resulting in a decrease of only in royalty income from st 
jude medical  in fiscal from fiscal unit sales of the angio seal increased in fiscal from fiscal we expect that royalty income from the angio seal device will continue to be a significant source of revenue for the foreseeable future 
as of june   approximately million angio seal units had been sold 
under our march agreement with orthovita to co develop and commercialize the vitoss foam products  we receive a royalty on orthovita s end user sales of all such vitoss foam products 
in addition  in august we acquired the proprietary rights of a third party  an inventor of the vitoss technology the inventor  for million the assignment agreement 
under the assignment agreement  the company receives an additional royalty from orthovita on the end user sales of all orthovita products containing the vitoss technology up to a total royalty to be received of million  with million remaining at june  we received our first royalty under these agreements in the third quarter of fiscal  when orthovita launched its initial bone grafting and spinal product lines  vitoss scaffold foam strips and cylinders 
royalty income from orthovita has increased since that time as orthovita has launched three additional product lines  vitoss scaffold foam flow  shapes and pack in june and october of and may of  respectively 
we believe the unique technology associated with the vitoss foam products and the growing spine market will result in the orthovita component of our royalty income becoming more significant over the next fiscal year and beyond 
total royalty income received from orthovita in fiscal was million 
cost of products sold 
our gross margin percentage in fiscal was consistent with fiscal  at 
cost of goods sold in fiscal includes an accelerated depreciation charge of  related to the transition to our new facility see item above and liquidity and capital resources below 
the effect of this acceleration of depreciation charge was a decrease to our gross margin percentage of approximately 
excluding the effect of this charge  we would have experienced an overall increase in gross margin during fiscal  reflecting the continued increase in volume of biomaterials product sales 
this increased volume  from both our existing customers and new customers  has resulted in manufacturing efficiencies 
in addition  we continue to work on process improvements  including automation  wherever possible and will continue to make progress in this area through fiscal we anticipate the gross margin on our biomaterials products will continue to improve with these process improvements and continued increased sales volume 
occasionally offsetting efficiencies gained as products mature  are the margins achieved on new product launches  which are often minimal related to start up process inefficiencies and learning curves 
we initiated two new product lines during fiscal  the orthovita vitoss scaffold foam shapes and vitoss scaffold foam pack 
during the initial phases of production of these product lines we incurred higher costs due to the learning curve associated with initiating new products 
while we anticipate continued improvement in the gross margin on our biomaterials products  these improvements will be offset by initial low margins of approximately to on the triactiv product line  associated with low volumes and start up inefficiencies 
our engineering teams are also working on process improvements and automation on the triactiv product and we anticipate margins will come in line with our overall product mix during fiscal as a result of our expanding product mix for fiscal  we believe our total gross margin  across all product lines  will be only slightly improved over fiscal  excluding the effect of future charges related to acceleration of depreciation 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of expenses incurred for the development of our proprietary technologies  such as the triactiv system  absorbable and nonabsorbable biomaterials products and technologies and other development programs  including expenses under the nist program 
in addition  an acceleration of depreciation charge of  was recorded as research and development expense in our fourth quarter of fiscal see item above and liquidity and capital resources below 
a major component of our research and development expense since fiscal has been our triactiv system us pivotal clinical study  the pride study  a randomized trial enrolling patients at sites in the us and europe 
we completed enrollment in the pride study during march  submitted a k application for fda clearance to market the triactiv system in the united states on july  and received clearance in march we started a us clinical trial registry  the aspire angioplasty in svgs with post intervention removal of embolic debris clinical study  on the next generation triactiv system  the triactiv fx system during the third quarter of fiscal and expect to complete enrollment by december with fda approval anticipated during the fourth quarter of fiscal the aspire study is a multi center  prospective registry  designed to support regulatory clearance of the triactiv fx system in the us for a saphenous vein graft svg indication 
the study will include approximately to patients at up to sites in the u 
s and europe 
we cannot make any assurances as to the successful completion of this trial or regulatory approval for the triactiv fx system or for future applications in the us or in europe 
clinical efforts in pursuit of fda approval and continuing development of future generations of the triactiv system  as well as our continued development of proprietary biomaterials products and technologies  require significant research and development expenditures 
we anticipate research and development expense  including additional clinical trials  will increase as we pursue commercialization of future generations of the triactiv system in the us  and explore opportunities for other indications related to the triactiv system  as well as our other technologies  including the continued development of proprietary biomaterials technologies 
while we believe research and development expenditures will increase in dollars  we believe that they will decrease as a percentage of total revenue 
research and development expense was of total revenues for the fiscal year ended june  compared to of total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our finance  information technologies  human resource and business development departments  as well as costs related to the sales and marketing of our products 
we also recorded an acceleration of depreciation charge related to the transition to our new facility see item above and liquidity and capital resources below of  in our fourth quarter of fiscal the general and administrative component has increased over the same period in fiscal this increase is a result of the overall growth of our business and the administrative requirements to support such growth  such as personnel expenses and expenses incurred related to compliance with new sec and corporate governance regulations 
also due to the growth in our business  including increasing manufacturing volumes of both biomaterials products and the triactiv system and the new planning and tracking requirements of selling the triactiv system directly to the market  we implemented a new enterprise resource planning erp system 
the new erp system integrates our manufacturing  quality  finance  sales and marketing and human resource processes into a single information system so our operational areas can share information more easily and efficiently 
implementation began in october and was completed in march and included costs such as the training our employees on the new system and licensing fees for the new system 
in addition  amortization expense of  related to the assignment agreement discussed in note and our consolidated financial statements included in this form k is included as a general and administrative expense fiscal year ended june  the amortization period is estimated at months from the date of the agreement 
the sales and marketing component of selling  general and administrative consists of expenses in the us and in europe related to the direct commercialization efforts for the triactiv system in both locations 
we have a twenty four person triactiv sales and marketing team in the us and a five person sales and marketing team headquartered at our european subsidiary  kensey nash europe gmbh 
these teams are selling and marketing the product direct in the us and german markets and  in europe  the team supports our distributor relationships in the rest of europe and in asia 
our sales and marketing expenses have increased in fiscal over the same period in fiscal this increase related primarily to costs of the launch of the triactiv system in the us  including the costs associated with the creation of the new endovascular direct sales force and the marketing campaign for launch 
we anticipate sales and marketing expenses will increase as we continue our sales and marketing efforts of the triactiv product  both in the us and in europe 
our sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase substantially in fiscal over fiscal we are also continuing to expand our marketing efforts for our biomaterials business 
income tax expense 
our effective income tax rate was approximately for fiscal year  for fiscal year and for fiscal year our fiscal effective income tax rate includes this year s research and development tax credit as well as non taxable interest income 
we are forecasting an effective tax rate for fiscal of approximately critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies revenue recognition  accounting for stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab  which superseded sab sab s primary purpose was to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  which was modified as a result of the issuance of emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
sales revenue 
sales revenue is recognized when the related product is shipped 
advance payments received for products or services are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized when the product is shipped or services are performed 
all of our shipments are free on board fob shipping point 
we reduce sales for estimated customer returns  discounts and other allowances  if applicable 
the majority of our products are manufactured according to our customers specifications and are subject to return only for failure to meet those specifications 
research and development revenue 
revenue under research and development contracts is recognized as the related expenses are incurred 
all revenues recorded on this line item are related to government programs under which the us government funds the research of high risk  enabling technologies 
royalty revenue 
royalty revenue is recognized as the related product is sold 
we recognize substantially all of our royalty revenue at the end of each month  in accordance with our customer agreements 
see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
accounting for stock based compensation 
through the end of fiscal  we accounted for stock based compensation costs under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment to fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  which permits i recognition of the fair value of stock based awards as an expense  or ii continued application of the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
we accounted for our stock based employee and director compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb under this intrinsic value method  compensation cost represents the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our common stock at the grant date over the amount the grantee must pay for the stock 
our policy is to grant stock options at the fair market value at the date of grant 
therefore  we have not recognized any compensation expense for options granted to employees 
options granted to non employees  as defined under sfas  as amended by sfas and eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  are recorded as compensation expense over the contractual service period using the fair market value method in accordance with sfas  which requires using the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair market value of the option at the original grant date 
we granted options to non employee  outside consultants during fiscal and see note to the financial statements for information regarding options granted to non employee outside consultants in july and october we account for restricted shares to non employee members of the board of directors and executive officers using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb we granted restricted shares to members of the board of directors and executive officers during fiscal and see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for restricted stock awards made to the non employee members of the board of directors and to executive officers of the company 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r amends sfas and apb and requires that the cost of share based payment transactions including those with employees and non employees be recognized in the financial statements 
sfas r applies to all share based payment transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services by issuing or offering to issue its shares  share options  or other equity instruments or by incurring liabilities in amounts based even in part on the price of the entity s shares or other equity instruments  or that require or may require settlement by the issuance of an entity s shares or other equity instruments 
this statement is effective for the company as of the first interim period beginning after june   which is the quarter ending september  management is currently assessing the effect of sfas r on the company s financial position or results of operations 
to date the company has expensed all share based payments to non employees and all restricted shares granted 
the effect of the statement will relate only to the company s expensing of stock options 
restricted shares 
the company has implemented a practice of granting restricted shares to the members of its board of directors as well as to its executive officers  as permitted under its stock option plans  as a component of board and executive officer compensation arrangements 
in response to growing industry concerns related to the effect of expensing stock options  the company has diversified its compensation arrangements to reduce the number of total options granted to board members and executive officers 
the compensation arrangements now include the granting of restricted shares as well as  for executive officers  a greater component of incentive cash compensation 
all compensation expense related to the board of directors is being recorded as a component of selling  general and administrative expense 
all compensation expense related to the executive officers is currently recorded as a component of either selling  general and administrative expense or research and development expense  dependent on the executive officer s functional area 
the first restricted shares were granted to the board of directors in december and the first restricted shares to executive officers were granted in july of allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our trade receivables balances are not overstated due to uncollectibility 
we maintain a bad debt reserve for all customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  trends in overall weighted average risk rating of the total portfolio  significant one time events and historical experience with each customer 
also  we record additional reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be adjusted 
we believe our allowance at june  was sufficient to cover all existing accounts receivable 
inventory valuation 
our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
adjustments to inventory are made at the individual part level for estimated excess  obsolescence or impaired balances  to reflect inventory at the lower of cost or market 
factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  physical deterioration and quality concerns 
revisions to these adjustments would be required if any of these factors differ from our estimates 
income taxes 
our estimated effective tax rate includes the impact of certain estimated research and development tax credits and non taxable interest income 
material changes in  or differences from  our estimates could impact our estimate of our effective tax rate 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years and the following table summarizes our operating results for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  fiscal year ended percent change from fy to fy june  millions of total revenues june  millions of total revenues revenues total revenues net sales research development revenue royalty income expenses cost of products sold research development expense selling  general administrative expense interest income net income total revenue and net sales 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales of products increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to sales of our biomaterials products  specifically our cardiology products  which grew in fiscal over fiscal cardiology product sales to st 
jude medical  our largest cardiology customer  were million compared to million in the prior year  due to increased collagen plug revenues  including  related to development of two new collagen plug product enhancements 
sales of anchors to st 
jude medical decreased  from the prior year 
as previously discussed  orthopaedic sales decreased  or  from fiscal mainly related to sales of sports medicine products to arthrex  which decreased  or million 
this was almost entirely offset by product sales to orthovita that increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal in addition  triactiv sales of approximately  increased from the prior year 
this increase was due to sales in the us of  following the company s april launch of the triactiv system and first quarter of direct commercial sales in the us  and sales in europe of  which included sales of the new triactiv fx  which launched in late march the triactiv sales represented just over of our total sales in fiscal research and development revenue 
research and development revenues decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal fiscal revenues were generated under the nist synthetic vascular graft development grant  which concluded in september in the prior fiscal year  revenues were generated under the nist synthetic vascular graft development grant and the nih breast cancer drug delivery grant  which concluded in september and october  respectively 
the decrease from the prior fiscal year reflects the conclusion of the nist vascular graft development grant in october  which provided  of revenue in fiscal and only  in fiscal royalty income 
royalty income decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal angio seal royalty income decreased to million from million in fiscal year and  respectively 
the decrease in angio seal royalty income was primarily due to a decline  from to  in the contracted royalty rate which occurred in april the original rate of was contractually reduced from to  in accordance with our license agreements  during the fiscal quarter ended december  when a cumulative one million angio seal units had been sold 
one final contracted decrease in the royalty rate  to  occurred upon reaching four million cumulative units sold in april and was the effective royalty rate at june  the decrease in royalty rate was partially offset by a greater number of units sold 
royalty units increased  as approximately million angio seal units were sold to end users during fiscal compared to approximately million units sold during fiscal we believe that the increase in units is due to st 
jude medical s continued sales and marketing efforts  which are resulting in greater market share and overall increased adoption of vascular closure devices in the market 
st 
jude medical s market share is estimated at in fiscal up from in fiscal and worldwide market penetration of vascular closure devices is estimated at approximately in fiscal up from approximately in fiscal and  respectively 
partially offsetting the angio seal royalty income decrease were royalties from orthovita on the vitoss and vitoss foam product lines 
total royalty income from orthovita was approximately million for fiscal compared to  for the fiscal year these royalties are received under the march manufacturing  development and supply agreement between our two companies and the acquisition of the separate vitoss proprietary rights from a third party inventor of the vitoss technology  both of which are discussed above 
also see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements patents and proprietary rights 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while gross margin was for both periods 
due to our plans to transition to a new facility  an acceleration of depreciation charge described above was recorded for  as a component of cost of goods sold 
offsetting this charge in cost of goods sold were higher margins on our biomaterials products attributable to higher volumes of cardiology product sales  which resulted in manufacturing efficiencies  increased volume in and additional experience on our spine product manufacturing processes  and continued allocation of overhead across greater sales volumes  resulting in a decrease in per unit costs 
the higher margins on biomaterials products were slightly offset by lower margins on the triactiv device related to low volume and the early stage of the manufacturing process 
we expect that the triactiv margins will continue to be lower than our biomaterials product margins until our manufacturing process matures and volumes increase 
research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal research and development expense also decreased as a percentage of total revenue to from for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the expense reductions were primarily due to the triactiv system on which spending decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal clinical trial expenses of  were million less in fiscal than in fiscal  due to the conclusion of the pride clinical trial in march clinical trial expenses in fiscal related to the triactiv fx aspire study 
this decrease was offset by increases in personnel costs  including travel expenses  restricted share and incentive compensation expense  facility and office costs  including the acceleration of depreciation charge  legal and consulting expenses  and operational and design costs  associated with new generations of the triactiv product  specifically the triactiv lfx system  the triactiv carotid system and the thrombus removal flush extraction system 
biomaterials and other proprietary technologies spending decreased  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary reason for the decrease were the efforts of several research and development personnel throughout fiscal on work performed for and reimbursed by st 
jude medical  resulting in the salaries and personnel costs of such employees being recorded as a component of cost of products sold as the related revenue was recorded as a component of sales 
this work included the development of three new product enhancements to the angio seal collagen plug 
the total of all applicable personnel costs related to this effort was  and was recorded as cost of products sold 
in addition  depreciation expense  excluding the acceleration of depreciation related to the facility transition  decreased  related to the conclusion of the nist grant 
depreciation on assets purchased for our nist grant were fully depreciated as of the conclusion of the grant in october  thereby reducing our biomaterials depreciation expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal offsetting these decreases  were legal fees which were higher related to a greater number of patent filings and increased patent maintenance fees of  and additional operational and design development costs of  related to development of new products and processes for our current and prospective customers 
we expect research and development expenses to increase as we investigate and develop new products  conduct clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals for our proprietary products 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this was attributable to increases of  in personnel costs  including restricted stock expense   in facility costs  including rent  electric  but primarily depreciation which increased  including a  acceleration of depreciation charge described above   in professional services   in public company expenses  including board compensation and sec filing fees and  in bad debt expense 
in addition  general and administrative expense for fiscal includes  related to the amortization of intellectual proprietary rights acquired in august see note patents and proprietary rights 
personnel expense has increased primarily due to the issuance of restricted shares and the related expense which was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal professional service fees  which include audit and tax fees and sarbanes oxley consulting fees increased primarily as a result of the sarbanes oxley act of  for which the company expensed  in fees related to compliance for the fiscal year ended bad debt expense increased due to a prior year collection of a previously reserved amount of  in the current period bad debt expense was  resulting in a  cumulative increase from the prior year comparable period 
sales and marketing expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of our us commercial launch efforts for the triactiv system  which increased million in fiscal from fiscal personnel expenses for the us sales and marketing department increased  relating to the expenses of the endovascular direct sales force 
as of june   we had a total of sales and marketing personnel including sales representatives  compared to a total of three sales and marketing employees at june  travel costs increased  due to recruiting and training conducted for the new sales team as well as post launch travel to prospective customers hospitals 
in addition  there was an increase of  in marketing expenses related to pre launch and post launch activities such as product training for the new sales team and the creation of marketing materials 
the triactiv system european sales and marketing costs decreased  or  this was due to the conclusion of the first study  a study to examine cost effectiveness of the triactiv system in saphenous vein graft patients  to support reimbursement of the product in europe 
this study concluded in december the first study results showed that the triactiv system substantially reduced day mace compared to a historical control of patients treated with embolic protection 
the reductions in complication rates will be used to generate a cost effectiveness analysis of the triactiv system which will be important for reimbursement in european countries  expected to be applied in fiscal first study expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of  this was offset by increases in personnel  marketing and convention expenses of   and  respectively 
this was in part due to a increase in the foreign currency exchange rate as well as the increased marketing efforts related to the launch of the new triactiv fx system 
net interest income 
interest expense decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this was due to a lower principal balance on our debt balance as we continued to make our required quarterly payments 
interest income increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal although our cash and investment balances decreased  this was more than offset by higher interest rates 
other non operating income expense 
other non operating income was  for fiscal compared to other non operating expense of  for fiscal this increase related primarily to  of revenue recognized from a  opportunity grant we received from the commonwealth of pennsylvania governor s action team see liquidity and capital resources section and note 
the remainder was due to net loss or gain on the sale of fixed assets 
comparison of fiscal years and the following table summarizes our operating results for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  fiscal year ended percent change from fy to fy june  millions of total revenues june  millions of total revenues total revenues total revenues net sales research development revenue royalty income expenses cost of products sold research development expense selling  general administrative expense interest income net income total revenue and net sales 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in the fiscal net sales of products increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of our biomaterials products  specifically our orthopaedic products  which increased in fiscal over fiscal orthopaedic product sales increased as a result of increased sports medicine product sales to arthrex  our largest orthopaedic customer  and the initial sales of a new spine product line to orthovita under an agreement entered into in march sales to these two customers increased million  or  and million  which was entirely new business  respectively  over fiscal these increases were partially offset by a million  or decrease in angio seal component sales 
the decrease in angio seal component sales was related to the on going transition of the manufacture of the absorbable polymer anchor from us to st 
jude medical offset in part by increases in sales of the collagen component related to increased sales volume of the angio seal device 
the triactiv sales represented less than of our total sales in fiscal and fiscal research and development revenue 
research and development revenues decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal fiscal revenues were generated under a nist synthetic vascular graft development grant and a nih breast cancer drug delivery grant 
in the prior fiscal year  revenues were generated under these same two grants in addition to the nist articular cartilage grant 
the nih breast cancer drug delivery grant provided revenue for four of the twelve months of fiscal  as the project concluded in october the nist vascular graft grant provided revenue for the entire year 
the decrease from the prior fiscal year reflects the conclusion of the nist articular cartilage grant in october  which provided  of revenue in fiscal and did not provide revenue in fiscal in addition  the decrease from the prior year reflected a decrease in reimbursements under the synthetic vascular graft grant  which generated  in revenue for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this decrease was attributable to the timing of animal studies  which are a significant component of the total reimbursement under the grant 
specifically  an animal study concluded prior to the second quarter of fiscal and another animal study started in late third fiscal quarter of  in contrast to fiscal where an animal study was being conducted throughout the year 
the following table summarizes the research and development revenue for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  grant fiscal fiscal percentage change from fy to fy nist articular cartilage nist vascular graft nih breast cancer drug delivery total r d revenue royalty income 
royalty income increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in royalty income was primarily due to an increase in angio seal royalties from st 
jude medical 
this increase occurred despite a decline  from to  in the contracted angio seal royalty rate in april our royalty rate as of june  was 
the increase in royalty income despite the fourth quarter reduction in royalty rate reflected a greater number of units sold as well as an increase in the average selling price for the angio seal 
royalty units increased  as approximately million angio seal units were sold to end users during fiscal compared to approximately  units sold during fiscal we believe that the increase in units is due to st 
jude medical s continued sales and marketing efforts  which are resulting in greater market share and overall increased adoption of vascular closure devices in the market 
st 
jude medical s market share was estimated at in fiscal up from in fiscal and worldwide market penetration is estimated at over up from approximately in fiscal and  respectively 
st 
jude medical launched the most recent generation of the angio seal product line  the sts plus platform in september commanding a premium price over the previous version of the device 
in fiscal  royalty income also included a new royalty from orthovita under the march manufacturing  development and supply agreement between our two companies 
this royalty is received on all co developed vitoss products of end user sales of such products by orthovita 
the first royalty was earned in the third quarter of fiscal when orthovita commercially launched the first co developed products 
royalty income from orthovita was approximately  for the fiscal year cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while gross margin increased to from for the same periods 
the increase in gross margin reflected the higher margins on our biomaterials products attributable in part to higher volumes  which resulted in manufacturing efficiencies  as well as continued allocation of overhead across greater sales volumes  resulting in a decrease in per unit costs 
the higher margins were slightly offset by lower margins on the triactiv device and new biomaterials products  specifically orthovita 
the triactiv margins will continue to be lower than our biomaterials product margins until our manufacturing process matures and volumes increase 
also  we initiated a new product line during the third fiscal quarter  orthovita s vitoss foam products 
during the initial phases of production of this product line we incurred higher costs due to the learning curve associated with new products 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal while research and development expenses continued to increase in dollars  they decreased as a percentage of total revenue to from for fiscal periods ended june  and june   respectively 
expense increases were primarily due to our development efforts on our biomaterials products including our work under the nist grant 
biomaterials and other proprietary technologies spending increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal related primarily to increases in personnel costs totaling  and facility costs  including rent  electric and depreciation of  to support our continued development of new products and processes for our current and prospective customers 
expense increases were also attributable to our continued development efforts on the triactiv device  including clinical trial expenses 
research and development expenses related to the triactiv system increased  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal expense increases occurred in personnel costs  facility costs  including rent  electric and depreciation  and patent counsel fees and other consulting costs  all of which were to support the final efforts on our pride clinical study and the growth in the development efforts on the next generation of the triactiv device  the triactiv lfx 
these cost increases were partially offset by a  decrease in fiscal from fiscal in various product design costs related to the triactiv svg application 
during fiscal  there were many new design features ease of use improvements for the triactiv product 
as of the third fiscal quarter  many of these design enhancements had been implemented and the expenses related to these improvements were not at the level they had been during the prior year 
in addition  there was a decrease in clinical trial costs  due to the conclusion of enrollment in the pride clinical study in march selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales and marketing expenses increased  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase related primarily to the triactiv european sales and marketing efforts  which increased  mainly due to a marketing clinical study in support of third party reimbursement of triactiv in europe 
the clinical study expenses increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal in addition  increases occurred in the overall operations in europe to support our clinical and commercial efforts  including personnel costs  convention and travel expenses  as well as office and facility costs  including rent  phone  and electric 
these increases in the european sales and marketing expenses include an exchange rate premium from fiscal to the average exchange rate in fiscal was  whereas the average exchange rate in fiscal was 
of the increases above  approximately  of the  related to the increase in the exchange rate  or of each of the increases stated above was directly related to the difference in the exchange rate 
the us marketing expenses increased  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily for personnel expenses  and pre launch activities  such as marketing materials and publications  as we prepare for our commercial launch of the triactiv device in the us general and administrative expenses increased  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this was attributable to increases of  in personnel costs   in facility costs  including rent  electric and depreciation and  in increased professional services and public company expenses  including investor relations and sec filing fees 
these personnel and facility cost increases were primarily related to the support of our continued sales and research and development growth  while increased professional fees as well as personnel costs were related to complying with the sarbanes oxley act of soa 
offsetting these increases was a decrease of  in audit and tax fees and a  decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
although the audit portion of our fees increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  our tax services fees in fiscal decreased by  related to a  professional service fee in fiscal for the research and development tax credit project performed 
there was a  professional service fee in fiscal when the final portion of the research and development tax credit project was performed 
related to the accounts receivable allowance  we were carrying a receivables reserve for an amount due from a company that had filed for bankruptcy 
the outstanding balance was subsequently paid and the reserve was no longer required 
net interest income 
interest expense decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this was due to a lower principal balance on our debt balance as we continue to make our required quarterly payments 
interest income decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal although our cash and investment balances increased  this was more than offset by lower interest rates 
other non operating income expense 
other non operating income was  for fiscal compared to other non operating expense of for fiscal other non operating expense income for both periods represented primarily the net loss or gain on the sale of fixed assets 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and investments were million at june   a decrease of million from our balance of at the end of our prior fiscal year  june  in addition  our working capital was million at june   a decrease of million from our working capital of million at june  operating activities net cash provided by our operating activities was million and million in the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
in the fiscal year ended june   we had net income of million  a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of million  non cash employee stock based compensation of  and non cash depreciation and amortization of million 
cash used as a result of changes in asset and liability balances was million 
the decrease in cash related to the change in assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable million  prepaid expenses and other current assets million and inventory million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses million 
this was partially offset by a decrease in the deferred tax asset million and an increase in current and non current deferred revenue 
the increase in accounts receivable primarily related to the increased sales volume during the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the same period of fiscal higher inventory levels related primarily to the build up of triactiv component parts as a result of our us commercial launch in april prepaid expenses and other current assets were up related to an increase in prepaid insurance due to higher total premiums on our business policies in fiscal over fiscal  greater deposits on equipment primarily related to year end orders for equipment to be placed into our new facility million and our an increase in our general prepaid balance for various company expenses  including but not limited to  maintenance contracts  future exhibition expenses  and dues and subscriptions 
accounts payable and accrued expenses grew primarily in our trade accounts payable balance  specifically for purchases related to our new building and our business expansion 
the increase in accounts payable was somewhat offset by a decrease in accrued expenses related to federal tax payments made during fiscal the deferred revenue balance increased related to an opportunity grant received from the department of community and economic development of the commonwealth of pennsylvania the dced see below 
finally  the decrease in the deferred tax asset balance was primarily due to the utilization of the majority of our deferred tax assets and increases to our deferred tax liabilities see note 
opportunity grant in november  the company was awarded a  opportunity grant from the dced 
this grant was awarded to the company in recognition of the potential job creating economic development opportunities created by the company s construction of its new facility within the state of pennsylvania 
the grant is conditioned upon meeting the following three criteria the company will create full time jobs within years  beginning april   the date of the company s request for the grant  the company will invest at least  in total project costs  including  but not limited to  personnel  land  building construction and machinery and equipment within three years  beginning july   the date of the company s facility groundbreaking and the company will operate at its new facility for a minimum of years 
the company received the cash payment of  in its third fiscal quarter revenue will be recognized as earned over the longest period contained within the grant commitment terms five years from the date of occupancy of the company s new facility 
this date of satisfaction of the last grant commitment is expected to be in december  assuming the original expectation for a transition to the new facility in january as of june  approximately  of revenue was recognized related to this grant as a component of other income 
investing activities cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended june  this was the result of purchase and redemption activity within our investment portfolio and capital spending related to the construction of our new facility see below and ongoing expansion of our manufacturing capabilities 
in addition  we spent million for the acquisition of the intellectual property rights of an inventor of the vitoss technology and  for the acquisition of patents and proprietary rights complementary to our biomaterials platform see note 
during the period  investments of million either matured  were sold or were called 
we subsequently purchased new investments with these proceeds for total investment purchases of million  providing net cash through investment activity of million 
see note to the financial statements included in this annual report for a description of our available for sale securities 
we had a million capital spending plan for fiscal  of which up to million was authorized for our new facility see discussion below by the end of our fiscal  and the remainder authorized to continue to expand our research and development and manufacturing capabilities and upgrade our management information systems mis technology infrastructure 
of this total plan  we have spent million during the year ended june   of which million related to ongoing operations of the company 
the remaining million was for the purchase of land and construction of our new facility 
we have a million capital spending plan for fiscal  which is to be expended primarily million on our new facility see discussion below and will also be used to continue to expand our research and development and manufacturing capabilities and upgrade our mis technology 
new facility our new facility will be located approximately two miles from of our existing facility in exton  pennsylvania 
long term  the proposed building site will be able to accommodate a  square foot facility and thus provide for our future growth and continued expansion 
our construction plan has three phases 
phase one is the construction of a  square foot building shell and the fit out of  square feet of space for our manufacturing and quality assurance operations 
phase one  which began in the first fiscal quarter of is expected to be completed early in our third quarter of fiscal and have a total estimated cost of million  including the land purchase 
phase two will complete the interior fit out of the  square feet and is anticipated to be complete within four months of phase one  or in the early fourth quarter of fiscal the second phase would allow the complete transition of all our personnel and operations to the new facility  with the exception of our model shop 
phase three would bring the building to a  square foot shell with an additional  square feet of fit out  and allow us to bring the entire organization into the new facility 
phase three is expected to be complete by june  phases two and three are estimated at an additional cost of million  including the purchase of additional land 
our current plan is to finance the construction of this building from current available cash on hand or liquid investments 
associated with management s finalization of the plan for transition of its operations to the new facility  which occurred on april   the company will record an acceleration of depreciation charge related to the assets to be abandoned at the time of transition 
the total value of assets to be abandoned was million at april  of which an acceleration of depreciation charge of  was recorded during the company s fourth quarter ended june  the remaining million is expected to be charged during fiscal year in addition to moving costs of approximately  for a total of million of transition costs during fiscal financing activities cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended june  this was the result of repayments of long term debt  and stock repurchases million offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
the exercise of stock options provided cash of million for the year ended june  we believe that option exercises are likely to continue through fiscal due to the current market price of our common stock compared to the average exercise price of outstanding options 
debt on september   we incurred an obligation in the amount of million in conjunction with the acquisition of thm biomedical  inc the obligation was due in equal quarterly installments 
in september the entire obligation was paid in full 
no debt remained on our balance sheet as of june  stock repurchase program on august   we announced that our board of directors had reinstated a program to repurchase issued and outstanding shares of the company s common stock over six months from the date of the board reinstatement 
the reinstated plan called for the repurchase of up to  shares  the balance under the original plan approved in october for the year ended june   we had repurchased and retired  shares of common stock under the reinstated program at a cost of approximately million  or an average market price of per share 
this program expired in february on march   we announced a new stock repurchase program under which the board approved an additional  issued and outstanding shares of our common stock 
this plan expires on september  as with the first stock repurchase program  we plan to continue to repurchase our shares for cash  from time to time in the open market  through block trades or otherwise 
the repurchase program does not require the company to purchase any specific dollar value or number of shares 
any further purchases under the program will depend on market conditions and may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
as of june   the company has repurchased and retired  shares of common stock under this new program at a cost of approximately million  or an average market price of per share  using available cash 
at june   there were  shares remaining for repurchase under this program 
research and development tax credit we recorded tax credits of   and  for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
the entire tax credit recorded for and  of the credit related to qualified research and development activities of the company for the period through general we plan to continue to spend substantial amounts to fund clinical trials  to gain regulatory approvals and to continue to expand research and development activities  particularly for the triactiv system and our biomaterials products 
in addition to the potential cash requirements associated with our announced reinstatement of the stock repurchase plan see below  we will continue to fund construction of our new facility to support the continued growth of our biomaterials business and commercial launch of the triactiv system  as discussed above 
we are marketing and selling the triactiv system in the us through a direct sales force 
we anticipate sales and marketing expenses will increase substantially as we continue to invest in the build of our us sales team and increased marketing efforts toward the success of the triactiv product platform 
we believe our current cash and investment balances  in addition to cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating  financing and capital requirements through at least the next months 
we also believe our cash and investment balances will be sufficient on a longer term basis  however  it will depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our existing and future products  the successful commercialization of products in development and costs associated with that commercialization  progress in our product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with pre clinical studies  clinical trials and product clearance by the fda and other agencies  the cost and timing of our efforts to expand our manufacturing  sales  and marketing capabilities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of our products 
the terms of any future equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders and the terms of any debt financing may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to pursue certain courses of action 
our ability to obtain financing is dependent on the status of our future business prospects  as well as conditions prevailing in the relevant capital markets 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing will be available to us  or will be available to us on acceptable terms should such a need arise 
presented below is a summary of our contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations  total in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  these obligations are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our operating leases 
our estimate of the time periods for which our cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund operations is a forward looking statement within the meaning of private securities litigation reform act of and is subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in such forward looking statements 
in addition to those described above  factors which may cause such a difference are set forth under the caption risk factors in this annual report on form k 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks  uncertainties and other factors described below  in addition to the other information set forth in this report  because they could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results  financial condition  cash flows and prospects as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 
risks related to our business the triactiv system was recently introduced in the united states 
if the triactiv system fails to gain or loses market acceptance  our business will suffer 
we expect that sales of the triactiv system in the united states will account for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future 
because of its recent commercial introduction  the triactiv system has limited product and brand recognition 
we do not know if the triactiv system will be successful over the long term 
market acceptance of the triactiv system may be hindered if physicians are not presented with compelling data from long term studies of the safety and efficacy of the triactiv system compared to alternative procedures 
we have no current plans to conduct such comparative studies 
in addition  demand for the triactiv system may not increase as quickly as we expect 
failure of the triactiv system to significantly penetrate current or new markets would negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for the triactiv fx system or any future generations of the triactiv device product platform in the united states 
the fda has not cleared the triactiv fx system for marketing nor have we completed the required clinical trials and or regulatory submissions on other future generations of the product platform 
prior to granting approval for commercial sale or for the commencement of clinical trials on future generations of the device  the fda may require clarification of information provided in our regulatory submissions  more information or more clinical studies 
if granted  fda approval may impose limitations on the uses for which our products may be marketed or how our products may be marketed 
should we experience delays or be unable to receive clearance from the fda  our growth prospects will be diminished 
we may not be successful commercializing current or future generations of the triactiv device product platform through a direct sales force 
we will commercialize the triactiv system  which has only recently been approved for sale in the united states  as well as future versions of the triactiv device through a direct sales force 
we may not be able to successfully recruit  develop and train our own sales force to sell and market the triactiv fx system or other future generations of the triactiv product platform 
we recently began the development of an initial direct sales and marketing force and must continue to develop and expand this force 
we had no prior experience hiring or training a sales and marketing force and may not be able to expand and maintain such a team with adequate technical expertise and which is capable of supporting distribution 
if we are unable to successfully commercialize current or future generations of the triactiv device  our growth prospects will be diminished 
we derive a substantial majority of our revenues from only three customers 
a substantial majority of our total revenues are derived from only three customers 
royalty income from  and sales of biomaterials to  st 
jude medical associated with the angio seal represented approximately of our total revenue for fiscal while sales of biomaterials products to arthrex  a distributor of orthopaedic products  represented approximately of total revenues and sales of biomaterials products to orthovita represented approximately of total revenue for fiscal it is not possible for us to predict the future level of demand for our products that will be generated by these customers or the future demand for the angio seal from customers of st 
jude medical 
our customer concentration exposes us to the risk of changes in the business condition of any of our major customers and to the risk that the loss of a major customer would adversely affect our results of operations 
for example  as a result of inventory overstock adjustments  sales to arthrex in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal our relationship with these customers is subject to change at any time 
we anticipate that a substantial portion of our revenues will continue to come from the angio seal  which is manufactured  marketed and distributed by st 
jude medical 
under our license agreements with st 
jude medical  the angio seal is manufactured  marketed and sold on a worldwide basis by st 
jude medical 
two of our significant sources of revenue for the future are expected to be sales of collagen to st 
jude medical for use in the angio seal and royalty income from the sale of the angio seal product line 
our success with the angio seal depends in part on the time  effort and attention that st 
jude medical devotes to the angio seal product line and on their success in manufacturing  marketing and selling the angio seal product line 
under the terms of our agreements with st 
jude medical  we have no control over the pricing and marketing strategy for the angio seal product line 
in addition  we depend on st 
jude medical to successfully maintain levels of manufacturing sufficient to meet anticipated demand  abide by applicable manufacturing regulations and seek reimbursement approvals 
st 
jude medical can terminate our arrangement at any time for any reason upon months notice 
at such time  all sales and marketing  manufacturing and distribution rights to the angio seal would be returned to us 
st 
jude medical may not successfully pass future inspections of its manufacturing facility or adequately perform its manufacturing  marketing and selling duties 
any such failure by st 
jude medical may negatively impact angio seal unit sales and therefore reduce our royalties 
if our biomaterials products are not successful  our operating results and business may be substantially impaired 
the success of our existing biomaterials products  as well as any we develop in the future  depends on a variety of factors  including our ability to continue to manufacture  sell and competitively price these products and the acceptance of these products by the medical profession 
in addition  we may be required to obtain regulatory approval for any future biomaterials products 
we will require substantial additional funds to develop and market our biomaterials products 
we expect to fund the growth of our biomaterials business out of our operating income  but this operating income may not be sufficient to develop new biomaterials products 
to date  we have relied on strategic partners or customers to market and sell our biomaterials products 
we cannot assure you that we will commercialize our products successfully through our existing and developing sales force 
we depend on our customers to market and obtain regulatory approvals for their biomaterials products 
we depend on the efforts of our biomaterials customers in marketing their products that include our biomaterials components 
there can be no assurance that our customers end use products that include our biomaterials components will be commercialized successfully by our customers or that our customers will otherwise be able to compete effectively in their markets 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and are likely to become more competitive  and our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
the markets for our current and proposed products are fragmented  intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and sensitive to new product introductions and enhancements 
we expect that the competitive environment for our products will become more intense as additional companies enter our markets and as new techniques and technologies are adopted 
our biomaterials and medical devices compete directly and indirectly for customers with a range of products and technologies produced by a wide variety of companies  as well as other processes and procedures which do not require the use of our products or those of our competitors 
many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories in these markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
our biomaterials products compete with the products of many of the larger companies in the industry 
in the vascular sealing device market  our products compete with products sold by datascope corporation  perclose  inc a subsidiary of abbott laboratories and vascular solutions  inc  amongst other smaller competitors 
the majority of vascular sealing is performed through manual compression  which represents our primary competition 
the triactiv system is currently commercially available in the united sates and europe where our competitors include boston scientific corporation  johnson and johnson  inc  medtronic  inc 
which owns percu surge  inc 
and guidant corporation  among others 
our competitors may have broader product lines  which allow them to negotiate exclusive  long term supply contracts and offer comprehensive pricing for their products 
broader product lines may also provide our competitors with a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations and other managed care organizations that are increasingly seeking to reduce costs through centralized purchasing 
greater financial resources and product development capabilities may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete 
because a significant portion of our revenue depends on sales of medical devices by our customers to the end user market  we are also affected by competition within the markets for these devices 
competition within the medical device market could also have an adverse effect on our business for a variety of reasons  including that our customers may compete directly with larger  dominant manufacturers with extensive product lines and greater sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
we are also unable to control other factors that may impact the commercialization of our components for end use products  such as marketing and sales efforts and competitive pricing pressures within particular markets 
if our products are not accepted by the medical community or if our products are replaced by new technologies  our business may suffer 
the success of our existing products depends on continued acceptance of these products by the medical community 
we cannot predict whether or not our products will continue to be accepted and if that acceptance will be sustained to over the long term 
the success of any products we develop in the future will depend on the adoption of these products by our targeted markets 
we cannot predict how quickly  if at all  the medical community will accept our future products or the extent to which our future products will be used 
if we encounter difficulties introducing future products into our targeted markets  our operating results and business may be substantially impaired 
in addition  new technologies and techniques may be developed which may render our current products  along with those under development  obsolete 
the loss of  or interruption of supply from  key vendors could limit our ability to manufacture our products 
we purchase certain materials and components for our products from various suppliers 
some of these components are custom made for us  including many of our absorbable polymer and suture raw materials which are used in our custom polymer products across all markets 
any loss of  or interruption of supply from  key vendors may require us to find new vendors 
we could experience production or development delays while we seek new vendors 
we may have problems manufacturing and delivering our biomaterials products in the future 
the biomaterials industry is an emerging area  using many materials which are untested or whose properties are still not known 
consequently  from time to time we may experience unanticipated difficulties in manufacturing and delivering our biomaterials products to our customers 
these difficulties may include an inability to meet customer demand  delays in delivering products or quality control problems with certain biomaterials products 
our use of hazardous materials exposes us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 
because we use hazardous substances in our research and development and manufacturing operations  we are potentially subject to material liabilities related to personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases or exposures at or from our facility 
decontamination costs  other clean up costs and related damages or liabilities could substantially impair our business and operating results 
we are required to comply with increasingly stringent laws and regulations governing environmental protection and workplace safety  including requirements governing the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous substances 
st 
jude medical s and our international sales are subject to a number of risks that could harm future international sales of angio seal and our ability to successfully commercialize new products in international markets

jude medical sells the angio seal product line internationally and pays us a royalty on each unit sold 
we also sell the triactiv device  as well as some of our other products  in the international markets 
our royalties from international sales of the angio seal product line by st 
jude medical and our revenues from our other international sales are subject to several risks  including the impact of recessions in economies both within and outside the united states  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs or other trade barriers  weaker intellectual property rights protection in some countries  fluctuations in exchange rates  potentially adverse tax consequences  and political and economic instability 
the occurrence of any of these events could seriously harm st 
jude medical s or our future international sales 
our success depends on key personnel  the loss of whom could impair our operating results and business 
our success depends  to a significant extent  upon the efforts and abilities of joseph w 
kaufmann  douglas g 
evans  wendy f 
dicicco and other members of senior management 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could harm our operating results and business 
in addition  we will not be successful unless we can attract and retain skilled personnel  particularly in the areas of research and product development 
our failure to expand our management systems and controls to support anticipated growth or integrate future acquisitions could seriously harm our operating results and business 
our operations continue to grow and we expect this expansion to continue as we execute our business strategy 
sustaining our growth has placed significant demands on management and our administrative  operational  information technology  manufacturing  financial and personnel resources 
accordingly  our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and other key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational  client support and financial control systems  and effectively expand  train and manage our employee base 
we may not be able to manage our growth successfully 
any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and harm our operating results 
we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products if appropriate opportunities arise 
the process of integrating any acquired business  technology  service or product into our business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
integration of any acquired company also may consume much of our management s time and attention that could otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 
furthermore  we may be unable to identify  negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
we are building a new manufacturing facility and will transition of our manufacturing capabilities to this new facility 
if we encounter difficulties in the transition phase  we may lose revenue  and we may be unable to maintain our customer relationships 
we manufacture all of the products we sell at our existing location in exton  pennsylvania 
we have purchased land and are currently constructing a new manufacturing facility near our existing facility 
we plan to transfer all of our manufacturing processes to this new facility in our second quarter of fiscal if the transition is delayed  we may have inadequate manufacturing capabilities to meet all of our customers requirements 
if we are unable to manufacture our customers products  or are unable to meet their production requirements  in our existing or new facility for any reason  we may lose revenue and or may not be able to maintain our relationships with our customers 
although we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost revenue and profits  this insurance would only cover losses experienced in the existing facility or new facility  once complete but does not cover transition delays or complications 
in addition  our business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact on relations with our existing customers resulting from our inability to produce products for them 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to vary substantially in the future as a result of a number of factors  some of which are not in our control  including market perception and customer acceptance of our products  market perception and acceptance of our customer s products  our efforts to increase sales of our biomaterials products  our efforts to commercialize the triactiv system through our existing and developing sales force  our efforts to gain ce mark and fda approval for future generations of the triactiv device  the loss of significant orders  changes in our relationship with st 
jude medical  our establishment of strategic alliances or acquisitions  timely implementation of new and improved products  delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  reimbursement for our products  increased competition  and litigation concerning intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
you should not rely upon our results of operations for any particular quarter as an indication of our results for a full year or any other quarter 
risks related to our intellectual property if we are unable to protect our patents and proprietary rights  our reputation and competitiveness in the marketplace may be materially damaged 
we regard our patents  biomaterials trade secrets and other intellectual property as important to our success 
we rely upon patent law  trade secret protection  confidentiality agreements and license agreements with st 
jude medical to protect our proprietary rights 
although we have registered certain of our patents with applicable international governmental authorities  effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which our products are made available  and we have not sought protection for our intellectual property in every country where our products may be sold 
the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to ensure that third parties will not infringe or otherwise violate our patents or similar proprietary rights 
we may be accused of infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and any related litigation could materially damage our operating results and business 
third parties may claim that we have violated their intellectual property rights 
an adverse determination in any intellectual property litigation or interference proceedings brought against us could prohibit us from selling our products  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
the costs associated with these license arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  the necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could subject us to costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel 
we do not own or control the use of the angio seal device trademark 
the term angio seal is a trademark of st 
jude medical 
all goodwill generated by the marketing and sales of devices bearing the angio seal trademark belongs to st 
jude medical and not to us 
should the st 
jude medical license agreements terminate  we would not have the right to call any of our products angio seal unless we purchase or license the trademark from st 
jude medical 
without rights to the angio seal trademark  we would have to market our products under a different trademark 
moreover  upon the termination of the st 
jude medical license agreements  st 
jude medical would have the right to compete against us by selling collagen and puncture closure devices under the angio seal trademark 
thus  purchasers of puncture closure devices may be more likely to recognize and purchase products labeled angio seal regardless of whether those devices originate from us 
risks related to our industry we may face product liability claims that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities 
the clinical testing  manufacture and sale of medical products involve an inherent risk that human subjects in clinical testing or consumers of the products may suffer serious bodily injury or death due to side effects or other unintended negative reactions to our products 
accordingly  the clinical testing  manufacture and sale of our products entail significant risk of product liability claims 
the medical device industry in general has been subject to significant product liability litigation 
any product liability claims  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  reduced sales  significant liabilities and diversion of our management s time  attention and resources 
we cannot be sure that our product liability insurance coverage is adequate or that it will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
we face uncertainty relating to third party reimbursement for our products 
we could be seriously harmed by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental or private healthcare payers  particularly to the extent any changes affect reimbursement for catheterization procedures in which our angio seal products are used 
physicians  hospitals and other users of our products may fail to obtain sufficient reimbursement from healthcare payers for procedures in which our products are used or adverse changes may occur in governmental and private third party payers policies toward reimbursement for these procedures 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation that could make it more expensive and time consuming for us to introduce new and improved products 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of governmental agencies  including the fda and comparable international agencies 
we are required to obtain the approval of the fda and international agencies before we can market and sell new products  satisfy these agencies requirements for all of our labeling  sales and promotional materials in connection with our existing products  comply with all applicable manufacturing regulations  and undergo rigorous inspections by these agencies 
compliance with the regulations of these agencies may delay or prevent us from introducing any new or improved products  including future generations of the triactiv system 
furthermore  we may be subject to sanctions  including temporary or permanent suspension of operations  product recalls and marketing restrictions if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations pertaining to our business 
we are also required to demonstrate compliance with the fda s quality system regulations 
the fda enforces its quality system regulations through pre approval and periodic post approval inspections 
these regulations relate to product testing  vendor qualification  design control and quality assurance  as well as the maintenance of records and documentation 
if we are unable to conform to these regulations  we will be required to locate alternative manufacturers that do conform 
identifying and qualifying alternative manufacturers may be a long  costly and difficult process and could seriously harm our business 
the fda and international regulatory agencies may also limit the indications for which our products are approved 
these regulatory agencies may restrict or withdraw approvals we have received if additional information becomes available to support this action 
risks related to our securities the trading price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate substantially in the future 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors  some of which are not in our control  including our ability to meet or exceed our own forecasts or expectations of analysts or investors  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements regarding clinical activities or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the medical device industry  changes in our own forecasts or earnings estimates by analysts  our partners ability to meet or exceed the forecasts or expectations of analysts or investors  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market  which have particularly affected the market prices of many medical device companies  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the market for our stock has experienced  and may continue to experience  price and volume fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance 
as a result  you may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price at which you purchase them 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
if any securities litigation is initiated against us  with or without merit  we could incur substantial costs  and our management s attention and resources could be diverted from our business 
future sales of our common stock in the public market by management and other stockholders with significant holdings could cause our stock price to fall 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by management or other significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or adversely affect our future ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities 
our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and delaware law may discourage an acquisition of our company 
provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of we have based these forward looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends affecting our business 
in this report  the words believe  may  will  estimate  continue  anticipate  intend  expect  plan and similar expressions  as they relate to kensey nash  our business or our management  are intended to identify forward looking statements  but they are not exclusive means of identifying them 
a number of risks  uncertainties and other factors could cause our actual results  performance  financial condition  cash flows  prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  the forward looking statements 
these risks  uncertainties and other factors include  among other things general economic and business conditions  both nationally and in our markets  the impact of competition  anticipated trends in our business  existing and future regulations affecting our business  strategic alliances and acquisition opportunities  and other risk factors set forth under risk factors above 
except as expressly required by the federal securities laws  we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise after the date of this report 
our results of operations in any past period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of high quality municipal and us government and corporate obligations 
the majority of the above investments have maturities ranging from approximately months to years 
in addition  the company has one security with a maturity of approximately years 
also  there are certain municipal variable rate demand obligations that have maturities ranging from to years 
these municipal variable rate demand obligations are putable weekly and callable on a monthly basis 
we mitigate default risk by investing in what we believe are safe and high credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with secondary or resale markets and we have an audit committee approved investment strategy which currently limits the duration of our investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and decrease in market value if interest rates increase 
at june   our total portfolio consisted of approximately million of investments 
while our investments may be sold at anytime because the portfolio includes available for sale marketable securities with secondary or resale markets  we generally hold securities until the earlier of their call date or their maturity 
therefore  we do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates 
we had no outstanding debt at june
