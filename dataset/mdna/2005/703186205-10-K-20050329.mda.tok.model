these are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical events 
the following comments should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements contained herein  as well as in our recent reports on forms k  q and k  each as it may have been amended from time to time 
overview in  we began our transition from being principally an engineering and research and development company toward being a products based company 
although we still fit the profile of an emerging company  this transition is evident in many aspects of our operations 
our statement of operations results reflect this  particularly with respect to the growth in product revenues in nevertheless  we have not become profitable  and we have not yet achieved as much market penetration as we are seeking to achieve 
since our inception on january   we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of common equity securities to investors and strategic partners  as well as from the issuance of convertible notes 
from january  through december   we incurred losses totaling million 
our existing capital resources may not be sufficient to fund our ambitious growth plans  and accordingly we are seeking additional financing 
at december   we had working capital of  and we raised million in a first quarter private placement equity financing 
results of operations for the years ended december  and revenues total revenues in were million compared to million in product revenues in were slightly more than million  an increase of  or  from product revenues of just under million for the growth in product revenues in versus came principally from increased sales of our cable products 
contract revenues in were  reflecting a decrease of  or  from contract revenues of  in the decrease in contract service revenues resulted from our continued transition to developing and selling products and away from providing contract research and development services 
we expect our future revenues to be predominantly based on the sale of our products in line with our products based business model 
at december   we recorded  in deferred revenue  including  related to sales to our japanese distributor  frontiers co 
ltd 
frontiers  pursuant to our policy on revenue recognition 
we will  pursuant to our revenue recognition policy  recognize as revenue the deferred revenue related to frontiers when frontiers has resold these products to end customers 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues in increased  to million from million in cost of product sales increased by  in to million from million in the increase in cost of product sales reflects the sale of a greater quantity of products in than in  and most of this increase results directly from the increased sales of our network access or cable products into the cable markets we serve 
our cable products compete in a highly competitive and commoditized market  and these products generally sell at significantly lower prices than do our products targeted at the other markets we serve 
we have not been able to achieve a corresponding decrease in the cost to manufacture these products 
cost of product sales includes the manufacturing fees from our contract manufacturer  our internal operations salaries and other costs 
cost of contract services decreased to  in from  in  reflecting our decreased level of product development efforts in line with our continuing move to a predominantly products based business model 
cost of contract services includes salaries of engineering personnel and other costs for technical and development services 
gross profits and margins gross profits for the twelve months ended december  were  compared to gross profits of million for the same period in the prior year 
gross profits on product sales were nearly equal   and  in and  respectively 
the gross margin percentage on product sales in declined from in due to a less favorable mix between low margin cable products and high margin long haul products than we experienced in  and because of a large cable market order in the first quarter of that significantly deteriorated our gross profit margins 
gross profits from contract revenues decreased from  in to  in the decrease in contract gross profits  year on year  was due to decreased levels of contract revenues 
engineering  research and development engineering  research and development expenses in increased to million from million in the increase in engineering  research and development expenses was due principally to increased engineering salaries and related benefits partially offset by lower expenses related to consultants and prototype development 
we continue to increase expenditures related to internal and external engineering resources for new product development and product sustaining efforts  therefore  we expect future engineering  research and development expenses will be higher  and such expenses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as research and development projects are carried out 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses in increased by over million  approximately  to million from million in the increase in sales and marketing expenses in resulted principally from a one time charge for the repurchase from aurora networks of the exclusive marketing rights to our cable products in north america and the most favored nation pricing right which aurora networks had as a reseller of our products  higher employee and employee related costs  and higher expenses for consultants 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in the future as we grow our channel partner network and pursue international markets 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses decreased to million  or nearly  in from million in the decrease is principally the result of incurring  less of non cash debt conversion expense in related to the conversion of convertible debt where the conversion price had been repriced favorably for the noteholder  debt conversion expense in was  general and administrative expenses also decreased because of lower expenses associated with amortization  consultants and bad debts 
the total decrease in these charges in was  these decreases were partially offset by increases in employee and employee related costs  general liability insurance expense  and other increased general and administrative costs 
we expect our spending for business infrastructure to increase in future periods 
our general and administrative expenses include the costs related to general management  finance  legal  information technology  investor relations  and other administrative functions 
such costs include  but are not limited to  salaries  employee benefits  rent  utilities  telephone and internet  insurance  and outside legal  accounting  and consulting fees 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense is a non cash item that is recognized in association with stock options having exercise prices below estimated fair value and or which overlie junior common stock and from vesting of restricted stock awards 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options is calculated as the difference between exercise prices and estimated fair market on the date of grant or subsequent measurement date 
if the options are subject to variable accounting treatment  then at each subsequent measurement date additional compensation expense  either positive or negative  is recognized based on the fair market value of our common stock in accordance with the provisions of variable stock option accounting 
stock based compensation for restricted stock awards is determined by the closing market price of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
unvested portions of restricted stock awards and stock options granted with exercise prices below fair market value are recorded as deferred compensation in the equity section of the balance sheet 
expense is recognized as the stock and options vest 
we expect a significant portion of the  of deferred compensation at december  to be recognized as stock based compensation expense in in  we recorded non cash compensation expense of  related to a restricted stock award that vested in favor of our former vice president of sales upon his early retirement from the company 
non cash stock compensation expense of  was recorded in related to options that vested to our former vice president of engineering 
stock based compensation expense will probably be materially higher in and years thereafter because sfas r will require us to expense the fair market value of employee stock options granted after june  as they vest 
interest income expense net interest expense totaled  in  a decrease of nearly  compared to million in the decrease in net interest expense predominantly results from non cash discount interest expense related to beneficial conversion feature and warrants coverage incurred in that was not incurred in interest expense includes both amortization of deferred interest and coupon interest related to our various convertible note borrowings in and in and  we had to finance our operations by borrowing money on harsh terms that resulted in such charges 
we ceased borrowing money under such terms in july august when we completed our successful public offering 
we had no new borrowings in  and much of our pre public offering debt was repurchased or converted before our actual cash interest payments in were  loss on early extinguishment of debt in  we recorded a loss of  related to the early extinguishment of convertible debt that we redeemed following the completion of our public offering 
net losses net loss for was million  a decrease of nearly  compared to a net loss of million for comparison for the years ended december  and revenues total revenues in and were million each 
product revenues in were million  a decrease of  from product revenues of million 
the decrease in product revenues resulted from lower sales to the cable markets 
the decline in cable products sales were partially offset by sales of products into the long haul markets during contract revenues in totaled  versus contract revenues of  in the increase in contract revenues resulted from our efforts to develop a product for which our partner  aurora networks  compensated us 
we generally retain all intellectual property rights to new products we develop under these types of arrangements 
license revenues in totaled  versus  in license fees in resulted from granting exclusive marketing rights to aurora networks for the product being developed under our agreement with them 
license fees in resulted from a distribution license we granted for an exclusive limited time to distribute one of our video gateway products that exclusive license has since expired 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues in was million  compared to total cost of revenues of million in product cost of sales in totaled million  compared to million in the decrease in product cost of sales during was mainly attributable to lower sales volume 
cost of product sales includes the manufacturing fees from our contract manufacturer  our internal operations salaries and other costs 
cost of contract services increased in to  from  in the increase in contract services costs was due to increased level of effort related to product development under compensated arrangements 
cost of contract services includes salaries of engineering personnel and other costs for technical and development services 
gross profits and margins gross profits for totaled million compared to million in gross profits from product sales were  and  in and  respectively 
gross profits from product sales in benefited from a more favorable sales mix that was weighted towards the higher margin long haul products we sell 
gross profits from contract revenues in increased  or approximately  over the increase in contract gross profits is mainly attributable to the higher revenues from contract services  although we experienced an decrease in contract gross margin in engineering  research and development engineering  research and development expenses increased to approximately million in from million in  representing a increase year on year 
the increase in engineering  research and development expenses was principally due to increased engineering salaries and related benefits 
we have increased engineering headcount and other engineering expenses for new product development and other sustaining engineering efforts 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses in increased by over million  or approximately  to million from  in the increase in sales and marketing expenses in resulted principally from the following increased salaries and employee related benefits expenses increased by  sales and marketing consulting expenses increased by  advertising and tradeshow expenses increased by  and travel and related expenses increased by  general and administrative our general and administrative expenses increased nearly to million in from million in the increase is principally from non cash debt conversion expense charges totalling  in related to the conversion of convertible debt where the conversion price had been repriced favorably for the noteholder  debt conversion expense in was  general and administrative expenses also increased because of increases in consultants and investor relations expenses totaling  while salaries and related employee benefits increased by  these increases were offset in part from decreases in other general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses include the costs related to general management  finance  legal  information technology  investor relations and other administrative functions 
such costs include  but are not limited to  salaries  employee benefits  rent  utilities  telephone and internet  insurance  legal  accounting  and consulting and management fees 
also included in general and administrative expenses is debt conversion expense related to the conversion of our convertible debentures 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense is a non cash item that is recognized in association with stock options having exercise prices below estimated fair value 
stock based compensation expense is calculated as the difference between exercise prices and estimated fair market on the date of grant or subsequent measurement date 
if the options are subject to variable accounting treatment  then each quarter additional compensation expense  either positive or negative  is recognized based on the fair market value of our common stock in accordance with the provisions of variable stock option accounting 
in  we recorded non cash compensation expense of  related to stock options  compared to non cash stock compensation expense of approximately  in discontinued operations in  we decided to dispose of our silicon systems business unit sistolic after a large semiconductor company  with which we entered into a non exclusive licensing agreement and an engineering services agreement related to sistolic s technology  informed us that they were terminating the agreement 
due to this material and adverse turn of events  we decided that we could no longer sustain the negative cash flow from sistolic 
on april   we disposed of the assets of this business unit back to metar srl and its president the executive in exchange for the elimination of our remaining obligations to metar srl and its affiliates  including the payable of  the return of all stock options granted to the executive and the romanian employees  and a confirmation that performance criteria specified in the executive s employment agreement with us related to a potential million bonus were never met by him 
we also received a limited use license to the business unit s intellectual property 
in addition  the romanian facility lease was transferred to metar srl and the romanian employment contracts were terminated 
metar srl was permitted to hire any and all romanian employees 
metar srl also received  shares of our common stock 
the executive resigned on march   as an officer of the company in anticipation of this transaction 
sistolic s results of operations for have been included in discontinued operations 
we recorded a loss of  from discontinued operations for interest income expense net interest expense totaled million in  compared to million in the decrease in net interest expense predominantly results from lower debt financing in compared to  and from the repayment of approximately million in convertible debt 
interest expense includes both amortization of deferred interest and coupon interest related to our european note and convertible note borrowings in and loss on sale of securities in  we recorded a loss on sale of securities totaling  liquidity and capital resources since our inception on january  through july we financed our operations primarily through the sale of common equity securities to investors and strategic partners  as well as from the issuance of convertible notes 
on july   we successfully completed a  public offering of million units and the listing of our common stock and units on the american stock exchange 
a unit consisted of three shares of common stock and two warrants  each warrant to purchase a share of common stock at per share 
on august   our underwriters exercised their over allotment option and we raised additional proceeds of  from the sale of  units  bringing total gross proceeds from the public offering the ipo to million 
on august   the units separated in accordance with their terms  and the ipo s common stock  shares and warrants  warrants now trade on the american stock exchange directly rather than as components of units 
in  prior to the ipo  we issued a total of million face value convertible notes payable for net proceeds of million cash and the refinancing of  of principal and interest due for notes issued during that had reached maturity 
a total of  of this convertible debt principal remains outstanding at december  the balance was repaid or converted into common stock 
in connection with the convertible debt  we also issued  warrants to purchase our common stock with an average exercise price of 
from january  through december   we incurred losses totaling million 
we have not yet achieved profitability  and we remain a risky enterprise 
our existing capital resources may not be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months 
at december   we had working capital of million 
cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled  versus million at december  in january and february  we raised a total of million in a private placement of  shares of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock with which we also issued  common stock warrants with an exercise price of per share 
based on our current commitments  we believe we have adequate working capital 
however  in order to finance our ambitious growth plans  we will seek to raise additional equity capital in the near term 
also  on february   we entered into a million revolving line of credit with laurus 
this revolving line of credit the loc is secured by our accounts receivables and other assets  and we have the ability to draw down advances under the loc subject to limits 
unless renewed by us  the loc will expire in our first quarter of under the terms of the loc  laurus can convert advances made to us into our common stock at a fixed conversion price of per share 
in connection with the loc  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
at december   no balance was outstanding under this loc 
we are considering entering into a new line of credit to finance our receivables and inventory to replace the existing laurus loc 
we are not yet profitable 
we need to increase our sales substantially to become profitable 
for the foreseeable future  we expect to incur substantial additional expenditures associated with cost of sales  marketing  and research and development  in addition to increased costs associated with staffing for management 
additional capital will be required to fully implement our business strategies and fund our plan for future growth and business development 
at december   we had no material commitments other than our operating leases 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the timing of research and product development efforts  the possible need to acquire new technology  the expansion of our sales and marketing efforts  and our expansion internationally 
we expect to continue to expend significant amounts in all areas of our operations 
cash used in operations in was approximately million  compared to million for the increase in cash used in operations in compared to the prior year was due primarily to the million adjustment in for accretion of debt discount and debt conversion expense 
cash used in investing activities in was  compared to  in cash used in investing activities in and was related to the purchase of engineering product development and testing equipment and systems software 
we anticipate the need for continued purchases of such equipment and software 
cash provided by financing activities in was  compared to cash provided of million in cash provided by financing activities in came principally from the exercise of warrants to purchase our common stock by one of the investors in our convertible notes issued in  partially offset by repayments of lease obligations 
our successful public offering in july and august provided cash  after expenses  of million 
we also raised million from the issuance of convertible debt in  most of which was later redeemed in the same year for million 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to customer revenues  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on our experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenue primarily from the sale of our video gateway products 
we sell our products through direct sales channels and through distributors or resellers 
we also derive revenue from contract services and license fees 
product revenue we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with the measurement of revenue in a given period 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines for determining the timing of revenue recognition 
at the time of the transaction  we assess a number of factors including specific contract and purchase order terms  completion and timing of delivery to the common carrier  past transaction history with the customer  the creditworthiness of the customer  evidence of sell through to the end user  and current payment terms 
based on the results of the assessment  we may recognize revenue when the products are shipped or defer recognition until evidence of sell through occurs or cash is received 
we recorded  of deferred revenue on our december  balance sheet as a result of this policy  primarily arising from shipments to our japanese distributor  frontiers 
deferred revenue which we have recorded which is related to the frontiers shipments will  in accordance with the policy  be recognized as revenue when frontiers has resold these products to end customers 
estimated warranty costs are calculated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
our products generally carry a one year warranty from the date of purchase 
contract service revenue revenue on engineering design contracts  including technology development agreements  is recognized on a percentage of completion method  based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs  subject to acceptance criteria 
billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of incurred costs and accrued profits are classified as deferred revenue 
license revenue revenues from license fees are recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery and acceptance have occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
balance sheet items inventory we record inventory  which consists primarily of raw materials used in the production of video gateways and related products  at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined principally on the average cost method 
provisions for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory are made based on an analysis of inventory levels and future sales forecasts 
the provision is re measured at each balance sheet date 
at december   we had accrued  for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory 
allowances for doubtful accounts we perform credit evaluations of our customers  and historically have not required collateral or deposits 
we establish allowances for doubtful accounts based upon current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions and historical customer payment practices  as well as for known or expected events 
if there were to be a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness  or if actual defaults were higher than our historical experience  our operating results and financial position could be adversely affected 
indemnification arrangements and guarantees in connection with our adoption of fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others  the following disclosures are made with respect to our product warranties 
we provide a limited warranty for our products 
a provision for the estimated warranty cost is recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
liabilities for the estimated future costs of repair or replacement are established and charged to cost of sales at the time the related revenue is recognized 
the amount of liability to be recorded is based on management s best estimate of future warranty costs expected to be incurred for its products still under warranty at the time of measurement 
this estimate is derived from analyzing trends in product failure rates and trends in actual product repair costs incurred 
our standard product warranty extends one year from date of sale  however  we may warrant products for periods greater than one year under certain circumstances 
the following table summarizes the activity in the liability accrual related to product warranty during the twelve months ended december  in thousands balance at december  decrease in accrual related to change in estimates actual warranty costs incurred in the period balance at december  we also undertake indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business related to our products  the licensing of our software  and the issuance of securities 
under these arrangements  we may indemnify other parties such as business partners  customers  and underwriters  for certain losses suffered  claims of intellectual property infringement  negligence and intentional acts in the performance of services  and violations of laws including certain violations of securities laws 
our obligation to provide such indemnification in such circumstances would arise if  for example  a third party sued a customer for intellectual property infringement and we agreed to indemnify the customer against such claims 
we are unable to estimate with any reasonable accuracy the liability that may be incurred pursuant to our indemnification obligations 
some of the factors that would affect this assessment include  but are not limited to  the nature of the claim asserted  the relative merits of the claim  the financial ability of the parties  the nature and amount of damages claimed  insurance coverage that we may have to cover such claims  and the willingness of the parties to reach settlement  if any 
because of the uncertainty surrounding these circumstances  our indemnification obligations could range from immaterial to having a material adverse impact on our financial position and our ability to continue in the ordinary course of business 
capitalized software development costs in connection with our adoption of aicpa sop sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  we have capitalized  or may capitalize in the future  certain of our software development costs in conformity with sop these pronouncements require capitalization of costs once certain criteria are met 
in the case of sop  costs to be capitalized are limited to employee wages and related costs to the extent of direct effort in the development  external direct material and services consumed  and interest expense incurred 
at december   we had capitalized  of our software engineering and test engineering costs incurred during the year for the development of software tools for internal use 
these tools comprise various new elements and improvements to existing elements of our automated test program atp that is used to test our current suite of products and product software code currently under development 
the costs capitalized consisted primarily of the salaries and employee benefits of our personnel directly involved in the development efforts and direct costs associated with third parties hired to assist with the development 
we anticipate that we will capitalize a material amount of this type of software development costs in off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as special purpose entities spes 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in statement however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt sfas r on july  a component of sfas r includes one of the following options a modified prospective method  b the modified retrospective method  restating all prior periods or c the modified retrospective method  restating only the prior interim periods of as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation expense for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend in part on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  we have not recognized any operating cash flows for such excess tax deductions in any of the periods presented 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of sfas r on our financial statements  including different option pricing models and which transition method to select 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas amends the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  which is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged  with certain exceptions 
sfas amends apb opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of sfas are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not currently believe that sfas will have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in december  fasb staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp fas was issued  providing guidance under sfas  accounting for income taxes for recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of  enacted on october  fsp fas allows time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effects of the jobs act before applying the requirements of fsp fas we are currently in the process of evaluating the potential effects of the jobs act and have not adjusted our tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the requirements of fsp fas in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  to amend the guidance in chapter  inventory pricing  of fasb accounting research bulletin no 
 restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins 
sfas clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage and requires these costs be treated as current period charges 
additionally  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
in march  the fasb issued eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which provided guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments 
additionally  eitf includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf  however the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june  we will evaluate the impact of eitf once final guidance is issued 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we would be exposed to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates primarily from any marketable securities and investments in certain available for sale securities 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate changes 
at december   we did not have any marketable securities or investments in available for sale securities  nor did we have any sales denominated in a currency other than the united states dollar 
our cash equivalents principal would not be materially changed by changes in interest rates  but as the short term instruments mature and roll over  we would be able to earn more interest in the future if interest rates rise our million revolving line of credit from laurus has a floating interest rate  and at december   we maintained a zero balance on this facility
