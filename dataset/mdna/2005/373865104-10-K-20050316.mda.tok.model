financial and other information by segment is included in note segment information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report and is incorporated into this item by reference 
management overview the company s performance in was overshadowed somewhat by the recording in the fourth quarter of a non cash  other than temporary impairment charge of approximately million after tax  or per share  related to certain investments in federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and federal national mortgage association fnma preferred stock 
public disclosures regarding accounting practices at fnma and a multi billion dollar fnma preferred stock issuance with a substantially different structure and higher yield than previous offerings had a detrimental effect on the fair value of both the fhlmc and fnma preferred stock holdings 
as a result of these factors and the magnitude and length of time the market value had been below cost  management could not forecast full recovery of the fair values in a reasonable time period and concluded that the preferred stock was other than temporarily impaired 
accordingly  the other than temporary impairment was recognized in the income statement as an investment securities loss 
the company s net income  inclusive of the impairment charge  for the year ended december   was  or per share  compared with net income of  or per share 
exclusive of the impairment charge  earnings would have been  or per share 
as is the case for many banking organizations  the company s largest source of revenue has historically been  and continues to be  derived from the spread earned between its interest income and interest expense 
as discussed in greater detail elsewhere in this discussion  improvements in the company s interest spread contributed to increased net interest income during compared to this improvement reversed a five year trend of declines in net interest income 
in recent years  management has taken steps to enhance and grow its sources of non interest related revenue such as insurance  trust administration  securities brokerage and financial planning in an effort to reduce the company s dependency on its net interest income and net interest spread 
the positive trends in growth in trust and investment product fees and in insurance revenues  principally attributable to insurance acquisitions during  continued in management expects that these non interest related revenue sources will continue to significantly enhance its financial performance in the coming years 
the company also has devoted increased emphasis in recent years to expanding its offering of loans and other products and services to business customers 
measured on an average basis  commercial agricultural loans grew by approximately in  the seventh consecutive year of growth within this component of the company s balance sheet 
the heightened management efforts to grow this component of the company customer base is directly attributable to management s belief that business customers  particularly small business customers  will value the company s approach of providing a combination of highly qualified professional financial advisors  local decision making  and customer focused products and services 
management has continued to endeavor to improve the company s operating efficiency through enhanced employee productivity and the control of operating expenses  as evidenced by the three year trend in the reduction in the number of full time equivalent employees 
the company s total operating expenses exclusive of the net loss on extinguishment of borrowings in increased modestly over those of  mostly due to costs associated with compliance with requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
in summary  management in expects to continue to reduce the company s reliance upon net interest income by increasing its emphasis on products and services that generate fees and commissions 
management also seeks to enhance the company s financial performance by increasing its offering of loans and other products and services to business customers  and operating more efficiently 
the statements of management s expectations and goals concerning the company s future operations and performance that are set forth in this management overview and in other sections of this item are forward looking statements  and readers are cautioned that these forward looking statements are based on assumptions and are subject to risks  uncertainties  and other factors 
actual results may differ materially from the expectations of the company that are expressed or implied by any forward looking statement 
the following discussion  as well as the discussion in item of this form k business entitled forward looking statements and associated risks which discussion is incorporated in this item by reference lists some of the factors that could cause the company s actual results to vary materially from those expressed or implied by any such forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the financial condition and results of operations for german american bancorp presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  and selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report  are  to a large degree  dependent upon the company s accounting policies 
the selection of and application of these policies involve estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are subject to change 
the critical accounting policies and estimates that the company has determined to be the most susceptible to change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights  the valuation of securities available for sale  and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and loss contingencies related to exposure from tax examinations 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover probable incurred credit losses at the balance sheet date 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the necessary allowance balance 
evaluations are conducted at least quarterly and more often if deemed necessary 
the ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the company s control 
the company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the determination of the allowance is inherently subjective  as it requires significant estimates  including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on other classified loans and pools of homogeneous loans  and consideration of past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the allowance consists of two components of allocations  specific and general 
these two components represent the total allowance for loan losses deemed adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
commercial  agricultural and poultry loans are subject to a standardized grading process administered by an internal loan review function 
the need for specific reserves is considered for credits when graded substandard or special mention  or when a the customer s cash flow or net worth appears insufficient to repay the loan  b the loan has been criticized in a regulatory examination  c the loan is on non accrual  or  d other reasons where the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question  or the loan characteristics require special monitoring 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individual credit that we believe indicates the loan is impaired 
specific allocations on impaired loans are determined by comparing the loan balance to the present value of expected cash flows or expected collateral proceeds 
allocations are also applied to categories of loans not considered individually impaired but for which the rate of loss is expected to be greater than historical averages  including those graded substandard or special mention and non performing consumer or residential real estate loans 
such allocations are based on past loss experience and information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values 
general allocations are made for other pools of loans  including non classified loans  homogeneous portfolios of consumer and residential real estate loans  and loans within certain industry categories believed to present unique risk of loss 
general allocations of the allowance are primarily made based on a five year historical average for loan losses for these portfolios  judgmentally adjusted for economic factors and portfolio trends 
due to the imprecise nature of estimating the allowance for loan losses  the company s allowance for loan losses includes a minor unallocated component 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses incorporates the company s judgmental determination of inherent losses that may not be fully reflected in other allocations  including factors such as economic uncertainties  lending staff quality  industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments  and broad portfolio quality trends 
therefore  the ratio of allocated to unallocated components within the total allowance may fluctuate from period to period 
mortgage servicing rights valuation mortgage servicing rights msrs are recognized and included with other assets for the allocated value of retained servicing rights on loans sold 
servicing rights are expensed in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing revenues 
impairment is evaluated based on the fair value of the rights  using groupings of the underlying loans as to type and age 
fair value is determined based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
to determine the fair value of msrs  the company uses a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income 
in using this valuation method  the company incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income  which include estimates of prepayment speeds  discount rate  cost to service  escrow account earnings  contractual servicing fee income  ancillary income  late fees  and float income 
the company periodically validates its valuation model by obtaining an independent valuation of its msrs 
the most significant assumption used to value msrs is prepayment rate 
in general  during periods of declining interest rates  the value of msrs decline due to increasing prepayment speeds attributable to increased mortgage refinancing activity 
prepayment rates are estimated based on published industry consensus prepayment rates 
prepayments will increase or decrease in correlation with market interest rates  and actual prepayments generally differ from initial estimates 
if actual prepayment rates are different than originally estimated  the company may receive less mortgage servicing income  which could reduce the value of the msrs 
other assumptions used in estimating the fair value of msrs do not generally fluctuate to the same degree as prepayment rates  and therefore the fair value of msrs is less sensitive to changes in these other assumptions 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates the possible impairment of msrs based on the difference between the carrying amount and the current fair value of msrs 
for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment  the company stratifies its portfolios on the basis of certain risk characteristics  including loan type and age 
if temporary impairment exists  a valuation allowance is established for any excess of amortized cost over the current fair value  by risk stratification  through a charge to income 
if the company later determines that all or a portion of the temporary impairment no longer exists for a particular strata  a reduction of the valuation allowance may be recorded as an increase to income 
the company annually reviews msrs for other than temporary impairment and recognizes a direct write down when the recoverability of a recorded valuation allowance is determined to be remote 
in determining whether other than temporary impairment has occurred  the company considers both historical and projected trends in interest rates  prepayment activity within the strata  and the potential for impairment recovery through interest rate increases 
unlike a valuation allowance  a direct write down permanently reduces the carrying value of the msrs and the valuation allowance  precluding subsequent recoveries 
as of december  the company analyzed the sensitivity of its msrs to changes in prepayment rates 
in estimating the changes in prepayment rates  market interest rates were assumed to be increased and decreased by 
at december  the company s msrs had a fair value of  using a weighted average prepayment rate of 
assuming a increase in market interest rates the estimated fair value of msrs would be  with a weighted average prepayment rate of 
assuming a decline in market interest rates the estimated fair value of msrs would be  with a weighted average prepayment rate of 
securities available for sale securities classified as available for sale are securities that the company intends to hold for an indefinite period of time  but not necessarily until maturity 
securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported separately in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
the company obtains market values from a third party on a monthly basis in order to adjust the securities to fair value 
additionally  securities available for sale are required to be written down to fair value when a decline in fair value is other than temporary  therefore  future changes in the fair value of securities could have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
in determining whether a market value decline is other than temporary  management considers the reason for the decline  the extent of the decline and the duration of the decline 
as of december   unrealized gains on the securities available for sale portfolio totaled approximately  this total is a net of unrealized gains on certain segments of the securities available for sale portfolio and unrealized losses on other segments of the portfolio 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a million non cash pre tax charge for the other than temporary decline in value on its fhlmc and fnma floating rate preferred stock portfolio 
the company accounts for these securities in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires that if the decline in fair market value below cost is determined to be other than temporary  the unrealized loss must be recognized as expense in the income statement 
during the quarter ended december   public disclosures regarding accounting practices at fnma and a multi billion dollar fnma preferred stock issuance with a substantially different structure and higher yield than previous offerings had a detrimental effect on the fair value of both the fhlmc and fnma preferred stock holdings 
in connection with the preparation of the company s financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  management in january concluded  as a result of the factors identified in the preceding sentence and the magnitude and length of time the market value had been below cost  that management could not forecast full recovery of the fair values of these securities in a reasonable time period 
accordingly  management determined to recognize the other than temporary impairment in the income statement for the fourth quarter of as an investment securities loss 
emerging issues task force eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  contains guidance regarding other than temporary impairment on securities that was to take effect for the quarter ended september  however  the effective date of portions of this guidance has been delayed  and more interpretive guidance is expected to be issued in the future 
the effect of this new and pending guidance on the company s financial statements is not known  but it is possible this guidance could change management s assessment of other than temporary impairment in future periods 
income tax expense income tax expense involves estimates related to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and loss contingencies related to exposure from tax examinations 
a valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers the likelihood that sufficient taxable income of appropriate character will be generated within carryback and carryforward periods  including consideration of available tax planning strategies 
as of december   the company has a deferred tax asset of million representing various tax credit carryforwards 
based on the long carryforward periods available  management has assessed it more likely than not that these credits will be realized and no valuation allowance has been established on this asset 
at december   the company also has a deferred tax asset representing unrealized capital losses on equity securities 
should these capital losses be realized  management believes the company has the ability to generate sufficient capital gains to realize the tax benefit of the capital losses during the available carryforward period  including the use of tax planning strategies related to mortgage servicing rights  appreciated securities and appreciated fhlb stock 
as a result  no valuation allowance has been established on this asset 
loss contingencies  including assessments arising from tax examinations and tax strategies  are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
in considering the likelihood of loss  management considers the nature of the contingency  the progress of any examination or related protest or appeal  the opinions of legal counsel and other advisors  experience of the company or other enterprises in similar matters  if any  and management s intended response to any assessment 
as discussed more fully in provision for income taxes  as well as note to the consolidated financial statements  an audit of the company by the indiana department of revenue is pending and an assessment may result 
based on the preliminary stage of this possible assessment  management s evaluation  after consultation with counsel  of the merits of the possible assessment  and management s intent to protest any assessment and defend its position  management has concluded that a loss is not probable at this time and no liability has been recorded at december  results of operations net income net income declined  or to  or per share in compared to  or per share during the earnings decline was directly attributable to a  after tax  or per share  other than temporary impairment charge on the company s portfolio of fhlmc and fnma preferred stocks 
excluding the effect of this other than temporary impairment charge  net income for would have been  or per share 
in comparing reported earnings for to  the impairment charge was mitigated to some degree by increased net interest income  increased trust and investment product fees and insurance fees  and no net loss on the extinguishment of borrowings during also contributing to the lower level of earnings in compared with was a decline in mortgage loan originations and subsequent sales of mortgage loans and an increased provision for loan losses 
in  the company earned net income of  or per share 
earnings for declined by approximately from the  and approximately from the per share reported for a lower number of shares outstanding resulting from a tender offer completed in march produced the lower percentage decline in earnings per share than that experienced in net income 
the lower level of earnings during compared to was attributable principally to a decline in net interest income of  and a net loss of  incurred with the prepayment of million of fhlb borrowings 
these significant factors were partially offset by double digit percentage increases in each category of non interest income which totaled  net interest income net interest income is the company s single largest source of earnings  and represents the difference between interest and fees realized on earning assets  less interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
several factors contribute to the determination of net interest income and net interest margin  including the volume and mix of earning assets  interest rates  and income taxes 
many factors affecting net interest income are subject to control by management policies and actions 
factors beyond the control of management include the general level of credit and deposit demand  federal reserve board monetary policy  and changes in tax laws 
net interest income increased during by  or  or on a tax equivalent basis compared to net interest margin is tax equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
for  the net interest margin increased to compared with in the company s increase in net interest income in compared with was largely attributable to the increased net interest margin that has been largely driven by a decline in the company s cost of funds 
the company s cost of funds has been reduced due to a number of factors including the historically low level of interest rates during and and the change in the mix of the deposit base to a higher dependence on non maturity deposits and less dependence on time deposits 
also contributing to the lower cost of funds during was the repayment of higher costing fhlb advances during in the company s mortgage banking segment 
in the second quarter of  the company s mortgage banking segment repaid a maturing fhlb advance in the amount of million with a rate of 
late in the third quarter of  the mortgage banking segment prepaid million of fhlb advances with an average rate of 
these advances had stated maturities in the third quarter of late in the fourth quarter of  the company s mortgage banking segment prepaid an additional million of fhlb advances with an average rate of 
these advances had stated maturities in the first quarter of during  these advances were carried at negative interest rate spreads ranging from approximately to compared to the short term investments that had been internally matched to the contractual repayment of these advances 
the extinguishment of these borrowings positively impacted the net interest margin and net interest income during the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  as illustrated in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  the company s core banking segment net interest income increased  in compared with the increase in the core banking segment was largely attributable to an increased level of earning assets driven by commercial loan growth and a stable net interest margin 
the core banking segment s net interest margin was able to remain stable due primarily to the decline in its cost of funds 
net interest income increased  during compared with in the company s mortgage banking segment primarily due to the repayment of the aforementioned fhlb borrowings 
total average earning assets declined by million during compared with primarily due to the repayment of fhlb advances within the mortgage banking segment during average total loans remained relatively stable  increasing million in compared with while total loans have remained relatively stable  the loan portfolio composition has changed 
average commercial loans increased million or in compared with mitigating to a large degree the growth in the commercial loan portfolio has been the continued decline in the average residential mortgage loan portfolio 
average residential mortgage loans declined million or during the year ended compared with net interest income declined during by  or  or on a tax equivalent basis compared with net interest margin is tax equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
for  the net interest margin declined to compared with for the company s net interest income was adversely impacted by the historically low levels of interest rates during the historically low interest rate environment resulted in a decline in overall earning asset yields including both the loan and securities portfolios 
the decline in interest rates through most of the first three quarters of resulted in increased prepayment speeds in the company s mortgage related securities portfolio  causing increased purchase premium amortization within that portfolio and thereby driving yields lower 
in addition  due to the low level of interest rates  the company was unable to reinvest the proceeds of the mortgage related securities repayments and cash flows from securities issued by state and local subdivisions at comparable yields 
the low level of interest rates also caused downward pressure on the yield in the company s loan portfolio 
the company s cost of funds was lowered significantly but not sufficiently to mitigate the decline in earning asset yield 
earning assets also declined during compared with and was largely attributable to a decreased residential mortgage loan portfolio and the repayment of fhlb advances within the mortgage banking segment 
the decline in interest earning assets was also attributable  to a lesser degree  to the self tender offer discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report and the purchase of company owned life insurance coli during mid the reduction in loans during compared with was attributable to the refinance activity in the residential loan industry that resulted from historically low interest rates and the company s continued sale of a majority of residential loan production in the secondary markets 
overall  the average loan portfolio declined by million or approximately during compared with average residential mortgage loans declined million or during partially mitigating the decline in average residential mortgage loans was growth in the commercial loan portfolio 
average commercial loans increased by million or during compared with the following table summarizes net interest income on a tax equivalent basis for each of the past three years

provision for loan losses the company provides for loan losses through regular provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
the provision is affected by net charge offs on loans and changes in specific and general allocations required on the allowance 
provisions for loan losses totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
the provision increased by  during compared with the company s allowance for loan losses and subsequent provisions for loan losses are typically analyzed at the individual affiliate bank level  the segment level  and finally at the consolidated level 
during  the core banking segment s provisions for loan loss totaled  while the mortgage banking segment totaled a negative  provision for loan loss 
these totals compare to a provision of  for the core banking segment in and a negative provision of  for the mortgage banking segment in during  the core banking segment s provision for loan loss totaled  while the mortgage banking segment totaled a negative  provision for loan loss 
the increase in provision for loan losses within the core banking segment during was largely attributable to the continued change in the composition of the company s loan portfolio toward a greater concentration in commercial and agricultural loans and less concentration in residential mortgage loans 
also contributing to the increased provision for loan losses has been an increase in specific allocations on internally classified loans and an overall higher level of net charge offs during the negative provision for loan losses in   and within the mortgage banking segment has been driven by a declining level of portfolio residential real estate loans held by the mortgage banking segment 
this decline has been due in large part to significant refinancing activity within the residential loan portfolio during and due to a historically low interest rate environment during those periods 
also contributing to the decline in the mortgage banking segment s residential loan portfolio has been the company s operating strategy to sell fixed rate residential real estate loans into the secondary market rather than to rebuild the mortgage banking segment s residential real estate portfolio 
these provisions were made at a level deemed necessary by management to absorb estimated  probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
a detailed evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is completed quarterly by management  the results of which are used to determine provisions for loan losses 
management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
refer also to the section entitled critical accounting policies and estimates and lending and loan administration for further discussion of the provision and allowance for loan losses 
non interest income non interest income for was  a decline of  or  as compared to  in the decline was predominantly attributable to an other than temporary impairment charge on the company s fhlmc and fnma preferred stock portfolio recognized in the fourth quarter of excluding the effect of this other than temporary charge of  non interest income for would have been  an increase of  or over that recorded in non interest income increased  or when comparing to all categories of non interest income increased by double digit percentages in non interest income dollars in thousands change from prior year trust and investment product fees    service charges on deposit accounts    insurance revenues    other operating income    subtotal    net gains on sales of loans and related assets   net gain loss on securities  n m total non interest income    n m not meaningful in  trust and investment product fees increased  or following an increase of  or in the increase in fees over the past two years was primarily attributable to increased production from german american financial advisors gafa 
gafa was formed mid year to provide expanded financial planning  full service brokerage  trust administration and other financial services 
service charges on deposit accounts increased and in and  respectively 
these increases were primarily attributable to the introduction of an overdraft protection service program during the second quarter of insurance revenues increased and in and  respectively 
the increased insurance revenues were primarily the result of insurance agency acquisitions completed in late and in september to a lesser degree  internal growth within the company s existing property and casualty insurance operations also contributed to the increase 
the most significant insurance agency acquisitions were completed september  on that date  the company acquired substantially all of the assets  net of certain assumed liabilities  of two property and casualty insurance agencies  hoosierland agency based in jasper  indiana and stafford williams agency based in washington  indiana 
these acquisitions significantly impacted the company s insurance revenues during and for more information on the business combination  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
for the year ended  other operating income increased 
the increase was partially attributable to an increase in the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance 
the company purchased million of coli during the third quarter of also contributing to the increase in other operating income was a reduced amount of mortgage servicing right impairment charges 
during  mortgage servicing right impairment charges were  as compared to  during the increase in other operating income for as compared to was also primarily due to reduced impairment charges in the mortgage banking segment 
impairment charges totaled  in net gains on sales of loans and related assets decreased in following a increase in the lower level of gains in resulted from lower residential mortgage loan production and subsequent loan sales 
for the period ended december   the increase was attributable to historically low interest rates which produced an increased level of loan production and sales 
loan sales for   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the company recorded a non cash  other than temporary impairment charge of   after tax related to certain investments in fhlmc and fnma preferred stock in the fourth quarter of for further discussion of the other than temporary charge  see the management overview and use of funds sections of this report as well as note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
non interest expense for the year ended  non interest expense decreased or  from the decline is primarily attributable to no net loss on extinguishment of borrowings  decreased salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expense offset by an increase in professional fees and other operating expenses 
non interest expense increased in non interest expense dollars in thousands change from prior year salaries and employee benefits    occupancy  furniture and equipment expense    fdic premiums data processing fees    professional fees    advertising and promotion supplies net loss on extinguishment of borrowings  n m other operating expenses    total non interest expense    n m not meaningful salaries and employee benefits expense  the largest component of non interest expense  was approximately  and of total non interest expense in   and  respectively 
for the year ended  salaries and employee benefit remained relatively stable with a modest decline 
in  the increase in salaries and employee benefits resulted from increased expenses associated with retirement benefits and sales related incentive compensation partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation based on overall financial performance 
in  the decrease in occupancy  furniture and equipment expense of was primarily attributable to a decline in real estate and personal property taxes 
in the state of indiana counties reassessed real property in which carried over into and resulted in a delay of some tax billings until due to the billing delay  the company adjusted property tax accruals and expense during which resulted in a reduced level of real estate and personal property expense 
occupancy  furniture and equipment expense increased in this increase was primarily attributable to increased building  furniture and equipment expense as well software licenses and maintenance agreements expense 
during and  professional fees increased and  respectively 
for  the increase was primarily the result of costs associated with ensuring the company s compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the increase in was attributable to an increase in general audit and accounting fees 
the company did not prepay any fhlb advances during during the company s mortgage banking segment prepaid million of fhlb advances which resulted in a  net loss on extinguishment of borrowings 
for further discussion of the prepayments of fhlb advances please see the net interest income section of this report 
other operating expenses increased and during and  respectively 
the company s property and casualty acquisition activity during late and in the third quarter resulted in an increased level of customer list intangible amortization during and the amortization expense associated with these acquisitions was  in and  in also contributing to the increase in other operating expenses for were increased claims incurred and an increased level of insurance reserves at the company s credit reinsurance subsidiary 
for further discussion of intangible amortization  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
provision for income taxes the company records a provision for current income taxes payable  along with a provision for deferred taxes payable in the future 
deferred taxes arise from temporary differences  which are items recorded for financial statement purposes in a different period than for income tax returns 
the company s effective tax rate was   and  respectively  in   and the effective tax rate in all periods is lower than the blended statutory rate of 
the lower effective rate in all periods primarily resulted from the company s tax exempt investment income on securities and loans  income tax credits generated by investments in affordable housing projects  and income generated by subsidiaries domiciled in a state with no state or local income tax 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for additional details relative to the company s income tax provision 
since december   the company s effective tax rate has been favorably impacted by indiana financial institution tax savings resulting from the company s formation of investment subsidiaries in the state of nevada by four of the company s banking subsidiaries 
the state of nevada has no state or local income tax 
an auditor employed by the indiana department of revenue department has  in the course of the department s pending audit of the company s financial institutions tax return for the year  advised the company that the department is considering issuing a notice of proposed assessment for unpaid financial institutions tax for the year of approximately   net of federal tax plus interest  based on the auditor s inclusion of the income of the nevada subsidiaries in the indiana return for that year 
if the department issues such a notice of proposed assessment  the company intends to file a protest with the department contesting the proposed assessment and would defend its position that the income of the nevada subsidiaries is not subject to the indiana financial institutions tax 
although there can be no such assurance  at this time management does not believe this potential assessment will result in additional tax liability 
therefore  no tax provision has been recognized for the potential assessment of additional financial institutions tax for or for financial institutions tax with respect to any of the nevada subsidiaries in any period subsequent to capital resources the company and affiliate banks are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications  including well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized  although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition 
the company and all affiliate banks at year end were categorized as well capitalized as that term is defined by the prompt corrective action regulations 
the company has agreed with its parent company correspondent bank lender  jpmorgan chase bank  na  as a term of its line of credit with that lender see sources of funds parent company funding sources  below that it will maintain the capital ratios of the company and its affiliate banks at levels that would qualify it as well capitalized as that term is defined by the prompt corrective action regulations 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for actual and required capital ratios and for additional information regarding capital adequacy 
the company continues to maintain a strong capital position

the mortgage related securities provide structured cash flows in what has continued to be a relatively low interest rate environment 
the company s level of obligations of state and political subdivisions declined million or during and million or in the decline in obligations of state and political subdivisions has been primarily the result of the company s strategy to not invest in these traditionally longer term securities during periods of relatively low interest rates 
the company continues to believe that at the proper time  investment in tax advantaged obligations of state and political subdivisions is prudent 
however  in the relatively low interest rate environment  investments in these types of securities have not been undertaken 
the company s equity portfolio in all periods disclosed in the table above was primarily comprised of floating rate preferred stock issued by fhlmc and fnma

management does believe that core deposits continue to represent a stable and viable funding source for the company s operations  but expects  in large part due to the prolonged low interest rate environment that has been experienced  that a portion of non maturity deposits may be less stable for the company in a time of prolonged economic recovery and increased interest rates 
demand  savings and money market deposits have provided a growing source of funding for the company in each of the periods reported

it is believed the interest rate environment has driven this migration 
other funding sources federal home loan bank advances and other borrowings represent the company s most significant source of other funding for its bank subsidiaries 
average borrowed funds decreased million or during this decline followed a decline of million or in borrowings comprised   and of total funding sources in   and  respectively 
the decline in average borrowed funds during and was primarily the result of repayment of fhlb advances  primarily by the company s mortgage banking segment  during the fourth quarter of and throughout during those periods the company s mortgage banking segment repaid approximately million of fhlb advances 
in some instances those advances were paid prior to maturity 
see net interest income and non interest expense for a discussion of the impact of these prepayments on the company s results of operations 
certificates of deposits in denominations of  or more and brokered deposits are an additional source of other funding for the company s bank subsidiaries 
large denomination certificates and brokered deposits increased million or during following a decline of million or in large certificates and brokered deposits comprised approximately of total funding sources in   and the bank subsidiaries of the company also utilize short term funding sources from time to time 
these sources consist of overnight federal funds purchased from other financial institutions  secured repurchase agreements that generally mature within one day of the transaction date  and secured overnight variable rate borrowings from the fhlb 
these borrowings represent an important source of short term liquidity for the bank subsidiaries of the company 
long term debt is in the form of fhlb advances  which are secured by the pledge of certain investment securities and residential mortgage loans

parent company funding sources the company is a corporation separate and distinct from its bank and other subsidiaries 
for information regarding the financial condition  result of operations  and cash flows of the company  presented on a parent company only basis  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
the company does not have access at the parent company level to the sources of funds that are available to its bank subsidiaries to support their operations 
the company derives most of its parent company revenues from dividends  fees  and interest paid to the parent company by its bank subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries are subject to statutory restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to the parent company 
the frb possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non bank subsidiaries that enable it to prevent or remedy actions that in its view may represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations 
among these powers is the ability in appropriate cases to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies 
the fdic and dfi possess similar enforcement powers over the bank subsidiaries of the company 
the prompt corrective action provisions of federal banking law impose further restrictions on the payment of dividends by insured banks which fail to meet specified capital levels and  in some cases  their parent bank holding companies 
in conjunction with the self tender offer the company completed on march   the parent company entered into a borrowing agreement with a correspondent bank lender  bank one  na  chicago  illinois now jpmorgan chase bank  na for the purpose of funding stock repurchases and parent company working capital needs 
the borrowing agreement included a revolving line of credit for up to million with interest payable quarterly at a rate of day libor plus with an additional commitment fee for the unused portion of the line of credit 
the line of credit was scheduled to terminate  and the amount borrowed was scheduled to become payable  in march the company initially borrowed million under the terms of the loan at the time the tender offer was completed 
the balance of the parent company borrowing totaled million at december  and million at march  jpmorgan chase bank  na  has agreed to modify and extend the line of credit and the amounts borrowed under similar terms to the initial loan  and the company anticipates that the new credit documents will be executed and delivered between the company and jpmorgan chase bank  na  prior to maturity of the initial loan 
the most notable modification to the terms will be an increase in the line of credit to million  of which million will be advanced at inception to renew the indebtedness for advances that had been made under the prior loan 
the new line of credit will terminate not later than august   and upon termination of the line of credit the amounts of all advances then outstanding will be due and payable 
the line of credit will include usual and customary covenants and conditions  including a covenant that requires that the company maintain the capital ratios of the company and of its affiliate banks at levels that would be considered well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations of the federal banking agencies 
the company intends to utilize dividends that are available from its banking subsidiaries as the primary source of repayment for its borrowings under this line of credit 
as described above  statutory and regulatory requirements may restrict the payment of dividends by the bank subsidiaries  depending upon their earnings and capital positions  during the period ending august   in amounts sufficient to retire the indebtedness of jpmorgan chase bank  na  in full by such time  in which event the company may seek to extend the line of credit or refinance the amount outstanding with that lender or seek other sources of equity or debt capital 
risk management the company is exposed to various types of business risk on an on going basis 
these risks include credit risk  liquidity risk and interest rate risk 
various procedures are employed at the company s affiliate banks to monitor and mitigate risk in their loan and investment portfolios  as well as risks associated with changes in interest rates 
following is a discussion of the company s philosophies and procedures to address these risks 
lending and loan administration primary responsibility and accountability for day to day lending activities rests with the company s affiliate banks 
loan personnel at each bank have the authority to extend credit under guidelines approved by the bank s board of directors 
executive and board loan committees active at each bank serve as vehicles for communication and for the pooling of knowledge  judgment and experience of its members 
these committees provide valuable input to lending personnel  act as an approval body  and monitor the overall quality of the banks loan portfolios 
the corporate risk management committee  comprised of members of the company s executive officers and board of directors  strive to ensure a consistent application of the company s lending policies 
the company also maintains a comprehensive risk weighting and loan review program for its affiliate banks  which includes quarterly reviews of problem loans  delinquencies and charge offs 
the purpose of this program is to evaluate loan administration  credit quality  loan documentation and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover probable  incurred credit losses identified during its loan review process 
management estimates the required level of allowance for loan losses using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgement  should be charged off 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of a specific reserves on individual credits  b general reserves for certain loan categories and industries  and overall historical loss experience  and c unallocated reserves based on performance trends in the loan portfolios  current economic conditions  and other factors that influence the level of estimated probable losses 
the need for specific reserves are considered for credits when a the customer s cash flow or net worth appears insufficient to repay the loan  b the loan has been criticized in a regulatory examination  c the loan is on non accrual  or  d other reasons where the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question  or the loan characteristics require special monitoring

the trend in the decline in residential mortgage loan allocations has resulted from the trend of declining net charge offs and the lower concentration of this type of loans 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses incorporates the company s judgmental determination of inherent losses that may not be fully reflected in other allocations  including factors such as economic uncertainties  lending staff quality  industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments  and broad portfolio quality trends 
therefore  the ratio of allocated to unallocated components within the total allowance has fluctuated from period to period 
net charge offs increased to  or of average outstanding loans during this level compares to net charge offs of  or of average outstanding loans in and  or of average outstanding loans in the increase in was attributable to a modestly higher level of loan charge offs of  coupled with a  reduction in the level of recoveries of previously charged off loans 
the increase in the level of loan charge offs in was attributable primarily to commercial and industrial loans  but was not necessarily attributable to a particular segment within the commercial and industrial portfolio 
the increase in net charge offs during followed declines in both and please see provision for loan losses in the discussion regarding the results of operations and allowance for loan losses in the discussion regarding critical accounting policies and estimates for additional information regarding the allowance 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of a non accrual loans  b loans which have been renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower  c loans past due days or more as to principal or interest  and  d other real estate owned 
loans are placed on non accrual status when scheduled principal or interest payments are past due for days or more or when the borrower s ability to repay becomes doubtful 
uncollected interest accrued in the current year is reversed against income at the time a loan is placed on non accrual 
loans are charged off at days past due  or earlier if deemed uncollectible 
exceptions to the non accrual and charge off policies are made when the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table presents an analysis of the company s non performing assets

a significant portion of the increase in non performing loans at year end related to a single commercial real estate credit 
management does not believe the non accrual status of this credit is indicative of its potential loss exposure and anticipates achieving a resolution of the problems that have resulted in this credit being placed on non accrual status by as early as june   on terms that would not result in a material loss to the company in excess of the amount that has been specifically reserved for this credit in the allowance for loan losses as of december  management considers the level of non performing loans to be manageable within the company s normal course of business  and continues to actively work with the borrowers that comprise the non performing loan portfolio 
the company is also continuing to monitor specific individual credits within the real estate development  manufacturing and lodging industry segments  that have not yet benefited from the improving economic climate 
interest income recognized on non performing loans for was  the gross interest income that would have been recognized in on non performing loans if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms was  loans are placed on non accrual status when scheduled principal or interest payments are past due for days or more  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
loan impairment is reported when full repayment under the terms of the loan is not expected 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate  or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
commercial  agricultural and poultry loans are evaluated individually for impairment 
smaller balance homogeneous loans are evaluated for impairment in total 
such loans include real estate loans secured by one to four family residences and loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures 
individually evaluated loans on non accrual are generally considered impaired 
impaired loans  or portions thereof  are charged off when deemed uncollectible 
the total dollar amount of impaired loans at december  was  for additional detail on impaired loans  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
liquidity and interest rate risk management liquidity is a measure of the ability of the company s subsidiary banks to fund new loan demand  existing loan commitments and deposit withdrawals 
the purpose of liquidity management is to match sources of funds with anticipated customer borrowings and withdrawals and other obligations to ensure a dependable funding base  without unduly penalizing earnings 
failure to properly manage liquidity requirements can result in the need to satisfy customer withdrawals and other obligations on less than desirable terms 
the liquidity of the parent company is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries  which are subject to certain regulatory limitations explained in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  as enhanced by its ability to draw upon a line of credit established by the parent company in march with a correspondent bank lender  as described under sources of funds parent company funding sources  above 
the affiliate banks source of funding is predominately core deposits  maturities of securities  repayments of loan principal and interest  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s financial condition to adverse changes in market interest rates 
in an effort to estimate the impact of sustained interest rate movements to the company s earnings  the company monitors interest rate risk through computer assisted simulation modeling of its net interest income 
the company s simulation modeling monitors the potential impact to net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
the company s objective is to actively manage its asset liability position within a one year interval and to limit the risk in any of the interest rate scenarios to a reasonable level of tax equivalent net interest income within that interval 
funds management committees at the holding company and each affiliate bank monitor compliance within established guidelines of the funds management policy 
see the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section for further discussion regarding interest rate risk 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements other than stand by letters of credit as disclosed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committees and boards of directors of the holding company and its affiliate banks 
primary market risks  which impact the company s operations  are liquidity risk and interest rate risk  as discussed above 
as discussed previously  the company monitors interest rate risk by the use of computer simulation modeling to estimate the potential impact on its net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
another method by which the company s interest rate risk position can be estimated is by computing estimated changes in its net portfolio value npv 
this method estimates interest rate risk exposure from movements in interest rates by using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in the npv of discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities 
npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the estimated market value of assets minus the estimated market value of liabilities 
computations are based on a number of assumptions  including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments in mortgage loans and certain types of investments 
these computations do not contemplate any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
in addition  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of computing npv 
should interest rates remain or decrease below current levels  the proportion of adjustable rate loans could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity 
in the event of an interest rate change  prepayment levels would likely be different from those assumed in the table 
lastly  the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate debt may decline during a rising interest rate environment 
the following table provides an assessment of the risk to npv in the event of sudden and sustained and increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates 
the table indicates that as of december  the company s estimated npv might be expected to increase in the event of an increase in prevailing interest rates  and might be expected to decrease in the event of a decrease in prevailing interest rates dollars in thousands

actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied therein as a result of certain risks and uncertainties  including those risks and uncertainties expressed above  those that are described in management s discussion and analysis in item of this report  and those that are described in item of this report  business  under the caption forward looking statements and associated risks  which discussions are incorporated herein by reference
