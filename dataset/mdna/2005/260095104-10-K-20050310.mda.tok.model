dover downs gaming entertainment  inc is a diversified gaming and entertainment company whose operations consist of dover downs slots a  square foot video lottery slots casino complex  the dover downs hotel and conference center featuring luxury accommodations with conference  banquet  fine dining  ballroom and concert hall facilities  and dover downs raceway a harness racing track with pari mutuel wagering on live and simulcast horse races 
more than of the company s gross revenue is derived from video lottery slot machine win as defined below 
several factors contribute to the video lottery slot machine win for any gaming company  including  but not limited to proximity to major population bases  competition in the company s market  the quantity and types of slot machines available  the quality of the physical property  other amenities offered on site  customer service levels  and marketing programs 
the company believes that it holds a strong position in each of these areas 
our entertainment complex is located in dover  the capital of the state of delaware 
we draw patrons from several major metropolitan areas 
philadelphia  baltimore and washington  dc are all within a hour drive 
according to the united states census  approximately million people live within miles of the complex 
there are significant barriers to entry related to the gaming business in delaware  such as the statutory limitation of gaming licenses to the three existing horse racing facilities 
the company s property  designed and developed with the assistance of caesars  is similar to properties found in the country s largest gaming markets 
the company offers the only luxury hotel in the delaware gaming market  providing a strong marketing tool  especially to higher end players 
the company also utilizes its recently improved slot marketing system to allow for the most efficient marketing programs and the highest levels of customer service 
because all of our operations are located at one facility  we face the risk of increased competition from the legalization of new or additional gaming venues 
the company has therefore focused on creating the region s premier gaming destination and building and rewarding customer loyalty through innovative marketing efforts and unparalleled customer service 
results of operations gaming revenues represent i the net win from video lottery slot machine wins and losses and ii commissions from pari mutuel wagering 
other operating revenues consist of hotel rooms revenue  food and beverage sales and other miscellaneous income

gaming expenses include the amounts collected by the state i for the state s share of the win  ii for remittance to the providers of the video lottery slot machines and associated computer systems  and iii for harness horse racing purses

during the first quarter of  we added new video lottery slot machines which increased our average number of machines from  in to  in additionally  we have redirected our marketing efforts to attract more profitable casino customers by providing additional complimentary and discounted rooms in our hotel 
we believe that our marketing efforts have been effective at attracting customers to our casino and consequently increasing slot win 
other operating revenues increased by  or  to  in  primarily due to higher occupancy levels at the dover downs hotel and conference center and increased food  beverage and concert sales  offset by the fact that other operating revenues in included proceeds of  related to the settlement of a business interruption insurance claim

prior to december  the points could be redeemed for various services and merchandise throughout the gaming facility  however  they were not redeemable for cash or casino play

amounts allocated from the video lottery operation for harness horse racing purses increased from  in to  in collectively  these statutory costs increased as a percentage of gaming revenues in as compared to in part due to a surcharge imposed by the state on the company s share of the video lottery slot proceeds that took effect in june of the remaining  increase in gaming expenses relates primarily to higher payroll and benefits  primarily as a result of our casino expansion  and increased marketing costs 
other operating expenses increased by  or 
concert promotion expenses  relating to a large outdoor concert promoted by the company in the third quarter of  represented the largest increase in other operating expenses

the act prohibits smoking inside the company s casino  hotel and conference center  restaurants  harness track indoor grandstands and simulcasting facilities  provided that smoking is permitted in up to of the rooms in the hotel 
prior to the effective date of the act  we derived significant revenues from designated smoking areas 
during the first year of the smoking ban  the company s slot win declined approximately compared to the previous year 
in december  slot win increased for the first time in versus the same month in  by approximately 
in an effort to increase the revenues from its three video lottery agents  the state passed legislation in june which extended the operating hours for video lottery agents and permitted the lottery director to authorize additional video lottery slot machines at each licensed facility 
during the first quarter of  the company constructed  additional square feet of gaming space and installed machines within its existing casino complex 
this brings the company s total number of video lottery slot machines to  the maximum number allowed by the lottery director at december  other operating revenues increased by  or  to  primarily due to higher occupancy levels at the dover downs hotel and conference center and the result of the hotel being open for all of compared with only a portion of the hotel opened with approximately rooms on february  and added rooms during the next two months with the entire room facility opened as of april  additionally  the company received  in the fourth quarter of from its insurance carrier to settle a business interruption claim related to the opening of the dover downs hotel and conference center

liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the increase in net earnings before depreciation and amortization and non recurring charges which did not require the use of cash from  in to  in  and the timing of payments to vendors 
net cash used in investing activities remained consistent at  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the additions primarily consisted of the construction of  additional square feet of gaming space to accommodate the installation of newly authorized video lottery slot machines within our existing casino complex and the purchase of a new customer management and slot data system

per share

additionally  the company expects to contribute approximately  to its pension plans in since our video lottery slot machine casino opened in  we have been party to a management agreement with caesars  under which caesars was our agent to supervise  manage and operate our video lottery slot machine casino 
effective december   that management agreement expired and we opted not to renew the agreement 
therefore  beginning in we will no longer be required to pay to caesars a management fee 
caesars performance based fees were  for the year ended december  we have a  unsecured revolving line of credit agreement  as amended effective november  at december    was outstanding under the facility 
based on current business trends  we believe that our cash flows from operations and the funds available pursuant to our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our short and long term cash needs 
any significant expansion of our gaming facility that we may decide to undertake  any significant acquisitions  or any material adverse change in our operations could cause the need for additional financing 
the company expects that its net cash flows from operating activities and funds available from its credit facility will be sufficient to provide for its working capital needs and capital spending requirements at least through the next twelve months  as well as any cash dividends the company s board of directors may declare 
we expect cash flows from operating activities and funds available from our credit facility to also provide for long term liquidity 
the introduction or expansion of gaming in and around our market area could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations

critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those the company considers critical in preparing its consolidated financial statements and or include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
points program the company currently has a point loyalty program for its video lottery customers which allows them to earn points based on the volume of their video lottery activity 
prior to december  the points could be redeemed for various services and merchandise throughout the gaming facility  however  they were not redeemable for cash or casino play 
effective december  the company changed its policy relating to its point loyalty program to allow points earned by customers to be redeemed for cash under certain circumstances 
as a result  the company recorded a non recurring charge in the fourth quarter of to record the net impact of the program change 
all points earned by customers are now expensed in the period they are earned 
the estimated amount of points redeemable for cash is recorded as a reduction of revenue and the estimated amount of points redeemable for services and merchandise is recorded as gaming expense 
in estimating the amount of the liability  which was  at december   the company estimates a redemption rate  a cost of rewards to be offered and the mix of cash  goods and services for which reward points will be redeemed 
we use historical data to estimate those amounts 
accrued pension cost the benefits provided by the company s defined benefit pension plans are based on years of service and employee s remuneration over their employment with the company 
the company establishes accrued pension costs in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
accrued pension costs are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider a number of factors  including estimates for the discount rate  assumed rate of compensation increase  and expected long term rate of return on assets 
changes in these estimates would impact the amounts that the company records in its consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment and up to years for facilities 
these estimates require assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment when an event occurs that indicates an impairment may exist 
recent accounting pronouncements see note summary of significant accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
factors that may affect operating results  forward looking statements in addition to historical information  this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  relating to our financial condition  profitability  liquidity  resources  business outlook  proposed acquisitions  market forces  corporate strategies  consumer preferences  contractual commitments  legal matters  capital requirements and other matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ substantially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward looking statements 
when words and expressions such as believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  plans  intends  objectives  goals  aims  projects  forecasts  possible  seeks  may  could  should  might  likely  enable or similar words or expressions are used in this document  as well as statements containing phrases such as in our view  there can be no assurance  although no assurance can be given or there is no way to anticipate with certainty  forward looking statements are being made 
various risks and uncertainties may affect the operation  performance  development and results of our business and could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in our forward looking statements  including the following factors success of or changes in our growth strategies  our development and potential acquisition of new facilities  anticipated trends in the gaming industry  patron demographics  general market and economic conditions  including consumer and corporate spending sentiment  our ability to finance future business requirements  our ability to effectively compete in the marketplace  the availability of adequate levels of insurance  our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and businesses  management retention and development  changes in federal  state  and local laws and regulations  including environmental  gaming license and tax legislation  the effect of weather conditions or travel on attendance at our facilities  military or other government actions  and national or local catastrophic events 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements as a result of future developments  events or conditions 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecast in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  stockholders should not overly rely or attach undue weight to our forward looking statements as an indication of our actual future results 
our gaming activities compete directly with other gaming facilities and other entertainment businesses we compete in local and regional markets with horse tracks  off track betting parlors  state run lotteries  casinos and other gaming facilities 
we cannot be certain that we will maintain our market share or compete more effectively with our competitors 
the introduction or expansion of gaming in neighboring jurisdictions  particularly maryland  virginia  washington  dc  pennsylvania or new jersey  or the legalization of additional gaming venues in delaware  could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations 
from time to time legislation is proposed for adoption in these jurisdictions which if enacted  would further expand state gambling and wagering opportunities  including video lottery slot machines at racetracks 
enactment of such legislation could increase our competition and could adversely affect our business  financial condition and overall profitability 
for example  in  the maryland senate passed a bill providing for various gaming venues for the third straight year 
the maryland house responded by passing its own bill which differs as to permissible venues  numbers of machines authorized  tax structure and siting approvals 
no consensus has yet been reached on compromise legislation capable of passing both the house and the senate 
approximately of our customers come from maryland  pennsylvania  virginia and the district of columbia 
in july  pennsylvania adopted legislation which authorizes up to  slot machines at various existing and proposed venues throughout the state 
it is difficult for us to predict the effect that such legislation will have on us  but we estimate that one or more facilities in pennsylvania are likely to begin operations during pennsylvania will have one of the highest effective tax rates on slot machine gaming in the country and will charge an up front  license fee to the horse racing and casino venues that are granted a gaming license 
management has estimated that slot win from pennsylvania patrons represents approximately of our total slot win 
all of our facilities are in one location our facilities are located adjacent to one another at a single location in dover  delaware 
any prolonged disruption of operations at these facilities due to destruction of or material damage to the facilities or other reasons could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we maintain property and business interruption insurance to protect against such types of disruption  but there can be no assurance that the proceeds of such insurance would be adequate to repair or rebuild our facilities in such event or to compensate us for lost profit during the period of any such disruption 
the revocation  suspension or modification of our gaming licenses would adversely affect our gaming business the delaware state lottery office and the delaware harness racing commission regulate our gaming operations 
our license from the commission must be renewed on an annual basis 
to keep our license for video lottery slot machine gaming  we must remain licensed for harness horse racing by the commission and conduct at least live race days each racing season  subject to the availability of harness race horses 
the commission has broad discretion to reject any application for a license or suspend or revoke a license once it is issued 
the lottery director has broad discretion to revoke  suspend or modify the terms of a video lottery license 
any modification or termination of existing licensing regulations or any revocation  suspension or modification of our licenses could adversely affect our business  financial condition and overall profitability 
our gaming activities are subject to extensive government regulation and any additional government regulation or taxation of gaming activities could substantially reduce our revenue or profit video lottery slot machine gaming  harness horse racing and pari mutuel wagering are subject to extensive government regulation 
delaware law regulates the win we are entitled to retain and the percentage of commission we are entitled to receive from our gaming revenues  which comprises a significant portion of our overall revenues 
the state granted us a license to conduct video lottery slot machine operations and a license to conduct harness horse races and pari mutuel wagering 
the laws under which these licenses are granted could be modified or repealed at any time and we could be required to terminate our gaming operations 
if we are required to terminate our gaming operations or if the amount of the commission we receive from the state for conducting our gaming operations is decreased  our business operations and overall profitability would be significantly impaired 
we believe that the prospect of significant additional tax revenue is one of the primary reasons why jurisdictions have legalized gaming 
as a result  gaming operators are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes 
these taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time 
we pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations and will likely incur similar burdens in any other jurisdiction in which we may conduct gaming operations in the future 
any material increase in taxes or fees  or the adoption of additional taxes or fees  may have a material adverse effect on our future financial results 
we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations 
these laws and regulations include  but are not limited to  restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages  environmental matters  employees  currency transactions  taxation  zoning and building codes  and marketing and advertising 
such laws and regulations are always subject to change  can be interpreted differently in the future  and new laws and regulations may be enacted which could adversely affect the tax  regulatory  operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and our company 
furthermore  noncompliance with one or more of these laws and regulation could result in the imposition of substantial penalties against us 
we do not own or lease our video lottery slot machines and related technology we do not own or lease the video lottery slot machines or computer systems used by the state in connection with its video lottery gaming operations 
the lottery director enters into contracts directly with the providers of the video lottery slot machines and computer systems 
the state purchases or leases all equipment and the lottery director licenses all technology providers 
our operations could be disrupted if a licensed technology provider violates its agreement with the state or ceases to be licensed for any reason 
such an event would be outside of our control and could adversely affect our gaming revenues 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and holds no derivative financial instruments which could expose it to market risk 
our exposure to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our variable rate borrowings of  at december  under our revolving credit facility 
a change in interest rates of one percent on the balance outstanding at december  would cause a change in total annual interest costs of  the carrying values of these borrowings approximate their fair values at december
