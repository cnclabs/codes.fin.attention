item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements contained in part iv of this annual report 
overview shire is committed to a strategy which is focused on the development of late stage projects and the marketing and selling of products in three main therapeutic areas cns  gi and gp  with the flexibility to add new therapeutic areas to the extent opportunities arise 
as a result of the company s recent reorganization a simplified operating model has been implemented 
the company will search  develop and market drugs in areas where it has a commercial presence 
the company will also seek to augment its existing portfolio of commercialized products by acquiring new products with substantive patent protection rather than just three years hatch waxman exclusivity 
the company will also focus its in licensing and m a efforts on the us market  obtaining european rights whenever possible 
the company has existing sales and marketing activities in the us  canada and europe 
the company is organized into four operating segments us  international  r d and corporate 
shire s revenues are primarily derived from product sales and royalties received on products that have been out licensed to third parties 
of total revenues is derived from product sales  of which is from adderall xr  and from royalties 
the geographic split of product sales is from the us and from international which represents all non us sales 
the markets in which the company conducts its business are highly competitive and highly regulated 
the health care industry is experiencing pressure from governments and healthcare providers to keep prices low whilst increasing the access to drugs  increased r d costs as clinical studies are typically larger and take longer to get approval from the regulators  challenges to existing patents from generic manufacturers  low cost generic drugs entering the market on expiration of patent protection  and higher marketing costs due to the use of direct to consumer campaigns and competition for market share 
shire s strategy has been developed to address these competitive pressures 
this has resulted in a series of initiatives in the following areas markets whilst the existing portfolio of approved products is heavily weighted towards the north american market  shire remains committed to diversifying the risk associated with being reliant on one market by continuing to expand its european operations 
the expansion in europe will be driven by the development of products with patent rights in both the north american and european markets wherever possible 
the us and swedish regulatory approvals of fosrenol  a new phosphate binder that reduces elevated blood levels of phosphate in patients with end stage renal disease  during is an example of shire s execution of this strategy 
shire will continue to pursue further european approvals for this product via the mutual recognition process 
in addition  and as a result of shire s strategic intent to focus on north america and europe  the company has sought out licensing partners to cover the japanese market for products in development 
the company has successfully out licensed the japanese marketing and development rights for agrylin and fosrenol to two companies with an established presence in this market 
r d over the last two years shire has significantly refocused its r d efforts and technology in order to concentrate on therapeutic areas where it has a commercial presence 
the company divested the vaccines business during and closed lead optimization in the third quarter of in addition the company has concentrated its resources on four projects that are currently in phase iii 
both of these actions are aimed at delivering the combined benefit of increased returns from the development of products that have a lower risk profile 
patents and market exclusivity the loss or expiration of patent protection or market exclusivity with respect to any of the company s major products could have a material adverse effect on future revenues and net income as generic manufacturers may produce similar drugs and generally sell these drugs at a lower price 
as adderall xr is shire s largest product  representing of total revenues  the loss  expiration or circumvention of patent protection on this product in particular could be material to the results of operations of the company 
shire is engaged in a number of legal proceedings with respect to its adderall xr patents and these are discussed below and in more detail in item legal proceedings 
new products with six product approvals in  the company aims to launch four new products during  including fosrenol 
the launch of fosrenol and other products will require significant investment to promote these products at the outset causing selling  general and administrative expenses as a proportion of product sales to increase in the short term 
infrastructure shire has advanced its plans to consolidate its number of north american sites from to a new us headquarters has been opened in wayne  pennsylvania during and the company is progressing well in centralizing the us operations on this site 
the cost of the reorganization was million in and this is analyzed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in part iv of this annual report 
this reorganization will improve the operational efficiency of the business and cost savings should be made over time 
results of operations for the years to december  and for the year to december   the company s total revenues increased by to  million  compared to  million in net income for the year to december  was million compared to million in  a decrease of 
the company s net income for has been impacted by both the loss on disposal of the vaccines business and the million of reorganization costs recorded in total revenues the following table provides an analysis of the company s total revenues by source year to december  change m m product sales   royalties licensing and development other revenues n a total   product sales year to december  product sales growth us prescription growth m m adderall xr agrylin xagrid pentasa carbatrol others n a total   the following discussion includes references to prescription and market share data for key products 
the source of this data is ims  december adderall xr us prescription growth for the year to december  was  due primarily to a increase in the us adhd market 
as of december  adderall xr had a market share of the total us adhd market december  despite increased competition and was the leading brand in the us adhd market 
the difference between sales growth and prescription growth is due to the impact of price increases in november  june and december which have been partially offset by higher sales deductions and allowances primarily medicaid rebates and promotional activities 
following submission to the fda of clinical data examining the effect of adderall xr in adolescent pediatric patients and meeting the fda s written request requirements  shire gained an additional six months market exclusivity for adderall xr in the us under the hatch waxman regulations 
this has extended the exclusivity period for the pediatric indication to april  in august the fda approved an adderall xr once daily treatment for adults with adhd 
adderall xr was made commercially available for the treatment of children in canada during february on february   shire announced that health canada had suspended sales of adderall xr in canada where sales in amounted to million 
following the health canada announcement  the fda issued a statement in which it advised that after consultation with the canadian authorities regarding the basis for their action  it did not feel that any immediate changes were warranted in the fda labeling or approved use of adderall xr in the us based on its preliminary understanding of health canada s analyses of adverse event reports and the fda s own knowledge and assessment of those reports 
although shire is complying with health canada s suspension request  the company strongly disagrees with the conclusions drawn by health canada and has lodged an appeal and taken other actions to preserve its legal rights and options 
it is too early to tell at the time of filing of this annual report on form k what impact the actions of health canada will have on consumer sentiment in the us adhd market or on adderall xr s us market share 
the company has filed suits against barr and impax in connection with their seeking to market generic versions of adderall xr 
shire has decided not to sue colony in connection with its seeking to market a generic version of adderall xr and is considering what action  if any  to take against teva 
in connection with it seeking to market a generic version of adderall xr 
although shire aggressively defends the patent rights covering its products against generic and other challenges  the loss or expiration of patent protection on this product in particular could have a material adverse effect on shire s financial condition and results of operations 
none of barr  impax  colony or teva may launch their generic versions of adderall xr before they receive final approval of their respective andas from the fda 
the lawsuits initiated by shire against barr and impax triggered stays of fda approval of their andas of up to months from the company s receipt of  respectively  barr s and impax s notices to allow the court to resolve the suits 
in the barr case  the latest month stay expires in february in the impax cases  the month stay for the mg product expires in may and for the strengths of mg  mg  mg  mg and mg  in june the impax court case is scheduled to go to trial in october and the barr court case is scheduled to go to trial in january should barr receive a tentative approval from the fda  it cannot lawfully launch its generic version before the earlier of the expiration of the latest currently pending month stay february or a district court decision in its favor 
none of impax  colony or teva will be able to lawfully launch a generic version of adderall xr without the necessary final approval from the fda 
the fda may grant days of generic market exclusivity to the first to file an anda and subsequent anda holders will have to wait for the expiration of the first to file s exclusivity rights should they be awarded fda approval

the company intends to defend its intellectual property  and as a result may need cash funding for litigation expenses incurred 
the company ordinarily finances its activities through cash generated from operating activities  private and public offerings of equity and debt securities and the proceeds of asset or investment disposals

off balance sheet arrangements there are no off balance sheet arrangements that  have or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
foreign currency fluctuations a number of operating units including the corporate office are located outside the united states 
as such  the consolidated financial results are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly those between the us dollar  canadian dollar  pound sterling and euro 
the accumulated foreign currency translation differences are reported within accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet 
as at december  the company had two outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with a total principal amount of million used to manage the risk associated with holding canadian dollar investments 
there were no material gains or losses on these contracts 
concentration of credit risk the company s revenues from product sales are mainly derived from agreements with major pharmaceutical companies and relationships with pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and retail pharmacy chains 
such clients typically have significant cash resources and as such the risk is considered minimal 
the company has taken positive steps to manage any credit risk associated with these transactions 
shire operates clearly defined credit evaluation procedures 
for the year to december   there were four customers in the us who accounted for of the company s total revenues 
financial instruments that potentially expose shire to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of short term cash investments and trade accounts receivable 
excess cash is invested in short term money market instruments  including bank and building society term deposits  commercial paper and other debt securities from a variety of companies with strong credit ratings 
these investments typically bear minimal risk 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services which are used in the business 
however  the company believes that the net effect of inflation on its operations has been minimal during the past three years 
critical accounting estimates the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as such  it is required to make estimates  judgements and assumptions that management believes are reasonable based on the information available 
the estimates  judgements and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies listed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in part iv of this annual report  that management believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its financial condition and the results of operations  are discussed below 
i litigation the company has a number of lawsuits pending that relate to product liability claims 
shire accounts for litigation losses in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
under sfas no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss 
where the estimated loss lies within a range and no particular amount within that range is a better estimate than any other amount the minimum amount is recorded 
in other cases management s best estimate of the loss is recorded 
these estimates are developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information becomes known 
in instances where shire is unable to develop a best estimate of loss  the lower end of the range is recorded 
the best estimates are reviewed quarterly and the estimates are changed when expectations are revised 
any outcome upon settlement that deviates from shire s best estimate may result in an additional expense in a future accounting period 
ii valuation of intangible assets the company has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets  recorded at acquisition cost 
as of december   the carrying value of such intangibles was million  which primarily related to the company s agrylin  carbatrol  colazide  fosrenol  mts methypatch  pentasa  reminyl  solaraze  and vaniqa products 
those assets which do not yet have a defined revenue stream and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed upon acquisition as acquired in process r d  and those that do have a defined revenue stream namely commercial products or rights to products awaiting final regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful life 
management s estimate of the useful life considers  inter alia  the following factors the expected use of the asset by the company  any legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life and the effects of demand  competition  and other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels 
there is a high occurrence of transactions involving the transfer of intangible assets between companies in the health care field  and valuations are usually based on discounted cash flow analysis 
the company uses a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets acquired  which requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk  the cost of capital  and terminal values 
each of these assumptions is significant to the value of the intangible asset 
the company engages independent valuation experts who review critical assumptions for significant acquisitions of intangibles 
the company reviews intangible assets for impairment periodically using an undiscounted net cash flows approach whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than its carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value  based on estimated discounted cash flows 
when cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
a prolonged general economic downturn  sustained government pressure on prices and  specifically  competitive pricing  could create an imbalance of industry supply and demand  or otherwise diminish volumes or profits 
such events  combined with changes in interest rates  could adversely affect shire s valuation of the estimated future net cash flows generated by its long lived assets 
as a result  future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by additional impairment charges related to the recoverability of long lived assets 
in the year to december   changes to the estimated future net cash flows from certain products resulted in a million impairment of intangible assets million  million 
the estimate of net cash flows from intangible assets changed in all three years following strategic business decisions by shire that resulted in a redirection of resources away from certain products that were no longer believed to be core to its business and towards products that shire believed to be more profitable and in line with its strategic direction 
in addition a decline in certain product prices and a decision not to renew product licenses that were not core to the business had a negative impact on the estimated net cash flows 
iii valuation of fixed asset investments the company has investments in certain public and private pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the carrying values of these investments are periodically reviewed for other than temporary impairments whenever certain events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an investment exceeds the fair market value of the investment 
indicators of other than temporary impairments include the market value of a quoted investment being below the carrying value of the investment for an extended period  adverse news on a private company s progress in scientific technology development of compounds  and recent stock issuances at a price below the investment price 
if the fair value appears to be below the carrying value the company considers all available evidence in assessing whether there is an other than temporary impairment 
this evidence would include the level of progress in the investee s scientific technology development of compounds  ongoing activity in collaborations with the investee  whether or not other substantial investee specific adverse events have occurred which may cause a decline in value  analysis and valuation of comparable companies  and the overall financial condition of the investee 
in instances when the review indicates that there is an other than temporary impairment  the company writes down the investment to the fair value of the investment  recording an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations net of any tax related effect 
the determination of the fair value of private company investments and the determination of whether an unrealized loss on a publicly quoted investment is permanent requires significant judgment and can have a material impact on the reported results 
during  shire recorded impairments on fixed asset investments of million million  million 
iv sales deductions sales deductions primarily consist of statutory rebates to state medicaid and other government agencies  contractual rebates with health maintenance organizations hmos  product returns  trade discounts  wholesaler chargebacks and allowances for the coupon sampling program 
statutory rebates to state medicaid agencies and contractual rebates with hmos are based on price differentials between a base price and the selling price 
rebates generally increase as a percentage of the selling price over the life of the product as prices increase 
provision for rebates are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales with estimates of future utilization derived from historical trends 
revisions or clarification from centers for medicare and medicaid services cms related to state medicaid and other government program reimbursement practices with retroactive application can result in changes to management s estimates of the rebates reported in prior periods 
however  at the time of sale  the prices of the company s products are fixed and consequently the rebates can be reasonably determinable at the outset of each transaction it undertakes with its customers  and therefore these factors would not impact the recording of revenues in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
provisions for product returns and trade discounts to customers are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales with estimates based upon past activity levels  the duration of time in the processing of deductions  and other factors such as the launch of a new drug  the loss of patent protection or new competition 
where such factors are relevant  shire develops provisions for returns based on wholesaler customer channel checks for slow moving product and a separate management review of estimated customer inventory levels  by product 
to the extent that shire is unable to estimate returns  recognition of revenue is deferred until either the product is sold to the pharmacy or until shire receives payment from the wholesaler 
shire accepts customer returns in the following circumstances a expiration of product  b product damaged while in the possession of shire  or c specific sales terms  at product launch  that allow for unconditional return of product guaranteed sales 
customer return periods range from one to twenty four months with an average return period of six months 
in addition  shire monitors customer inventory levels  based on estimated prescription demand  and limits the amount of product shipped to a customer when there appears to be a protracted pattern of customer ordering that exceeds shire s estimate of underlying demand 
the practice of monitoring inventory levels allows shire to more accurately predict customer returns 
the actual experience and the level of these deductions to revenue may deviate from the estimate 
shire revises its estimates every period and may be required to adjust the estimate in a subsequent period 
there have been no material adjustments to the estimates recognized related to shire s provisions for sales rebates or returns  in any of the periods presented 
v income taxes shire operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments 
because shire operates globally  the nature of the audit items are often very complex 
the company employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible 
the company also has significant deferred assets due to net operating losses nols in the united states  canada and other countries 
the realization of these assets is not assured and is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the future 
management has exercised judgment in determining the extent of the realization of these losses based upon estimates of future taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which these nols exist 
where there is an expectation that on the balance of probabilities there will not be sufficient taxable profits to utilize these nols a valuation allowance has been made against these deferred tax assets 
if actual events differ from management s estimates  or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted in the future  any changes to the valuation allowance could materially impact the company s financial position and results 
although the valuation allowance has decreased overall in  the movement includes an increase of million decrease million  due to changes in estimates of shire s ability to utilize nols in the future 
the overall movement is a consequence of various items  including tax planning strategies entered into by shire and based on revised projections of operating results by tax jurisdiction 
at december   the company had gross deferred tax assets of million and had recorded a valuation allowance of million against this amount 
at december   the company had gross deferred tax assets of million and had recorded a valuation allowance of million against this amount
