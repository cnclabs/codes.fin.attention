item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a seller of spoken audio and nostalgia products  including audiobooks and old time radio shows  through direct response  retail and internet channels 
our content and products are sold in multiple formats  including physical cassette and compact disc and secure digital download formats 
on march   we received an infusion of million in private equity financing from several institutional investors 
we retired all of our borrowings and our cash reserves increased to approximately million 
because of this financing  we believe that we have sufficient cash to implement our new strategy  including for required marketing expenditures  for at least twelve months 
we report financial results on the basis of four business segments  corporate  audio book club  radio spirits and mediabay 
com 
a fifth division  radioclassics  is aggregated with radio spirits for financial reporting purposes 
except for corporate  each segment serves a unique market segment within the spoken word audio industry 
in  our audio book club segment had net sales of approximately million  our radio spirits segment had net sales of approximately million  our mediabay 
com segment had sales of approximately million and we had eliminating inter segment sales of million 
we derive our principal revenue through sales of audiobooks  classic radio shows and other spoken word audio products directly to consumers principally through direct mail 
we also sell classic radio shows to retailers either directly or through distributors 
we derive additional revenue through rental of our proprietary database of names and addresses to non competing third parties through list rental brokers 
we also derive a small amount of revenue from advertisers who advertise on our nationally syndicated classic radio shows 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns  bad debts  the carrying value and net realizable value of inventories  the recoverability of advances to publishers and other rightsholders  the future revenue associated with deferred advertising and promotion costs  investments  fixed assets  the valuation allowance provided to reduce our deferred tax assets and valuation of goodwill and other intangibles 
the securities and exchange commission sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however the following policies are considered to be critical within the sec definition revenue recognition we derive our principal revenue through sales of audiobooks  classic radio shows and other spoken word audio products directly to consumers principally through direct mail 
we also sell classic radio shows to retailers either directly or through distributors 
we derive additional revenue through rental of our proprietary database of names and addresses to non competing third parties through list rental brokers 
we also derive a small amount of revenue from advertisers included in our nationally syndicated classic radio shows 
we recognize sales to consumers  retailers and distributors upon shipment of merchandise 
list rental revenue is recognized on notification by the list brokers of rental by a third party when the lists are rented 
we recognize advertising revenue upon notification of the airing of the advertisement by the media buying company representing us 
allowances for future returns are based upon historical experience and evaluation of current trends 
the historical return rates for abc members have been consistent for the past year and our estimate is based on a detailed historical examination of trends 
based on the current performance and historical trends  we do not expect significant changes in the estimate of returns for abc members 
the estimate of returns for wholesale sales of our old time radio products is based on a detailed review of each significant customer  depending on the amount of products sold to a particular customer in a specific periods  the overall return rate for wholesale sales could vary 
we record reductions to our revenue for future returns and record an estimate of future bad debts arising from current sales in general and administrative expenses 
these allowances are based upon historical experience and evaluation of current trends 
if members and customers return products to us in the future at higher rates than in the past or than we currently anticipate  our net sales would be reduced and our operating results would be adversely affected 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  which addresses the income statement classification of certain credits  allowances  adjustments  and payments given to customers for the services or benefits provided 
we adopted eitf no 
effective january   and  as such  have classified the cost of these sales incentives as a reduction of sales 
the effect on sales of applying eitf no 
in  and was   and  respectively 
downloadable content revenue from the sale of individual content titles is recognized in the period when the content is downloaded and the customer s credit card is processed 
content revenue from the sale of content subscriptions is recognized pro rata over the term of the subscription period 
rebates and refunds are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period in which the rebate or refund is paid in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
accounts receivable valuation we record an estimate of our anticipated bad debt expense and return rates based on our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers  including either individual consumers or retail chains  were to deteriorate  or if the payment or buying behavior were to change  resulting in either their inability or refusal to make payment to us  additional allowances would be required 
for example  a one percent increase in returns as a percentage of gross sales for the year ended  assuming a constant gross profit percentage and all other expenses unchanged  would have resulted in a decrease in net sales of  and a increase in net loss available to common shares of  a one percent increase in bad debt expenses as a percentage of net sales  assuming all other expenses were unchanged  would have resulted in an increase in bad debt expenses and a corresponding increase in net loss available to common shares of  income taxes the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary timing differences become deductible 
we determine the utilization of deferred tax assets in the future based on current year projections by management 
based on a change in our strategy  which we believe will result in lower sales and losses in the near term  but ultimately will be more profitable  we have determined that it is not more likely than not that we will  in the foreseeable future  be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset 
we have accordingly made an adjustment to the deferred tax asset recording an increase to the valuation allowance  resulting in a deferred tax expense charged against income in the fourth quarter of  the period when such determination was made 
deferred member acquisition costs promotional costs directed at current members are expensed on the date the promotional materials are mailed 
the cost of any premiums  gifts or the discounted audiobooks in the promotional offer to new members is expensed as incurred 
we account for direct response advertising for the acquisition of new members in accordance with aicpa statement of position  reporting on advertising costs sop 
sop states that the cost of direct response advertising a whose primary purpose is to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the advertising and b that results in probable future benefits should be reported as assets net of accumulated amortization accordingly  we have capitalized direct response advertising costs and amortized these costs over the period of future benefit the average member life  which has been determined to be generally months 
the costs are being amortized on accelerated basis consistent with the recognition of related revenue 
in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted the amortization period for advertising to attract customers to its world s greatest old time radio continuity program and revised the estimate period for amortization of these advertising costs down to months  which resulted in an increase in advertising expenses for the year ended december  of sop requires that the realizability of the mounts of direct response advertising reported as assets should be evaluated at each balance sheet date by comparing the carrying amounts of the assets to their probable remaining future net revenues 
based on the change in our strategy we have determined that the future net revenue from our audio book club does not support the carrying amount of the direct response advertising reported as assets relating to the audio book club 
accordingly  we have made an adjustment to write off the carrying amount of the asset in the fourth quarter for resulting in an increase in advertising expense of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that an intangible asset that is acquired shall be initially recognized and measured based on its fair value 
the statement also provides that goodwill should not be amortized  but shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount 
at december   we had million of goodwill  all of which relates to our radio spirits operations 
we completed our annual impairment test as of january  utililizing the services of an independent third party appraiser  which did not result in an impairment loss 
however  if conditions or circumstances were to change resulting in a deterioration of our radio spirits business  a future impairment of goodwill could be necessary
