interest expense increased  or  due to the accelerated amortization of the subordinated debt discount resulting from the amended subordinated note agreements  coupled with an increase in the effective interest rate on outstanding debt prior to the debt refinancing in june subsequent to the debt refinancing  interest expense has declined principally due to lower amortization of the discount on the restructured subordinated debt  coupled with the effect of a lower senior debt balance 
other income decreased million primarily due to gains on sales of assets recognized in the prior year  which reflected the sale of five previously closed stores 
these gains were partially offset by a loan commitment fee expensed in fiscal the company owns several long lived assets that are classified as held for sale as a result of disposal activities that were initiated prior to the initial application of sfas accordingly  gains and losses realized on the sales of these assets are classified as other income  net  in compliance with sfas  under the transition guidance provided in paragraph of sfas for fiscal  the company recognized a million tax benefit related to a reduction in the income tax valuation allowance triggered by the establishment of a deferred tax liability for the modification of the beneficial conversion feature on its convertible subordinated debt

ebitda the company s operating performance is evaluated using several measures 
one of those measures  ebitda  is a non gaap financial measure that is derived from the income loss from operations  which is a gaap measurement 
ebitda has historically been used by the company s lenders to measure compliance with certain financial debt covenants 
the company s revolving credit facility generally defines ebitda as the consolidated income loss from operations set forth in the company s consolidated statements of operations before depreciation  amortization  other noncash expenses  interest expense  taxes  noncash income and extraordinary gains or losses  and other nonrecurring items of income or expense as approved by the required lenders 
ebitda is the denominator used in determining all of the financial covenant ratios that are measured against predefined limits for compliance under the company s revolving credit facility 
see debt  note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
noncompliance with any of the financial covenants would constitute an event of default under the company s revolving credit facility  requiring the company to obtain replacement financing to repay amounts owed under these agreements and to meet future working capital requirements 
management believes that such replacement financing would be available and that the cost of such financing would not have a significant effect on the company s liquidity or results of operations 
page 
table of contents the company believes that ebitda provides a meaningful measure of liquidity  providing additional information regarding the company s cash earnings from ongoing operations and the company s ability to service its long term debt and other fixed obligations 
ebitda increased by million from fiscal to compared to an increase of million from fiscal to these net changes were due to various reasons noted above 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
the following table reconciles the company s non gaap financial measure  ebitda  with income from operations  prepared in accordance with gaap 
fiscal year ended august  august  as adjusted august as adjusted days days days in thousands income from operations plus excluded items reversal of provision for asset impairments and restaurant closings gains on sales  net relocation and voluntary severance costs depreciation and amortization noncash executive compensation expense ebitda as noted previously  prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation  including the applicable reclassifications of store activity discontinued in accordance with the implementation of the business plan 
while the company and many in the financial community consider ebitda to be an important measure of operating performance  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  such as operating income and net income 
in addition  the company s definition of ebitda is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

affiliations and related parties page 
table of contents affiliations the company entered into an affiliate services agreement effective august   with two companies  pappas partners  lp and pappas restaurants  inc  which are restaurant entities owned by christopher j 
pappas and harris j 
pappas  the company s ceo and coo  respectively 
that agreement was amended on july   to limit the scope of expenditures therein to professional and consulting services because there had been a significant decline in the use of professional and consulting services from pappas entities 
additionally  on july   the company entered into a master sales agreement with the same pappas entities 
through this agreement  the company contractually separated the design and fabrication of equipment and furnishings from the affiliate services agreement 
the master sales agreement covers the costs incurred for modifications to existing equipment  as well as custom fabrication  including stainless steel stoves  shelving  rolling carts  and chef tables 
these items are custom designed and built to fit the designated kitchens and are also engineered to give a longer service life than comparably manufactured equipment 
the pricing of equipment  repair  and maintenance is set and evaluated periodically and is considered by management to be primarily at or below market for comparable goods and services 
to assist in periodically monitoring pricing of the transactions associated with the master sales agreement and the affiliate services agreement  the finance and audit committee of the company s board of directors has periodically in the past used independent valuation consultants 
as part of the affiliation with the pappas entities  the company leases a facility  the houston service center  in which luby s has installed a centralized restaurant service center to support field operations 
the building at this location has  square feet of warehouse space and  square feet of office space 
it is leased from the pappas entities by the company at an approximate monthly rate of per square foot 
from this center  luby s repair and service teams are dispatched to the company s restaurants when facility or equipment maintenance and servicing are needed 
the facility is also used for repair and storage of new and used equipment 
the amount paid by the company pursuant to the terms of this lease was approximately   and  for fiscal   and  respectively 
the company previously leased a location from an unrelated third party 
that location is used to house increased equipment inventories due to store closures under the business plan 
the company considered it more prudent to lease this location rather than to pursue purchasing a storage facility  as its strategy is to focus its capital expenditures on its operating restaurants 
in a separate transaction  the third party property owner sold the location to the pappas entities during the fourth quarter of fiscal  with the pappas entities becoming the company s landlord for that location effective august  the storage site complements the houston service center with approximately  square feet of warehouse space at an approximate monthly rate of per square foot

pappas and harris j 
pappas are general partners of phcg investments

related parties in june  new two year employment contracts were finalized for christopher and harris pappas 
as in the past four years  they will both continue to devote their primary time and business efforts to luby s  while maintaining their roles at pappas restaurants  inc critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note  nature of operations and significant accounting policies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of the financial statements requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we believe the following are the company s critical accounting policies due to the significant  subjective and complex judgments and estimates used when preparing our consolidated financial statements 
we regularly review our assumptions and estimates with the finance and audit committee of the company s board of directors 
income taxes the company records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and page 
table of contents liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carrybacks and carryforwards 
the company periodically reviews the recoverability of tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary 
management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability 
in addition  the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years 
historically  the company has been periodically reviewed by the internal revenue service irs 
the company is currently under review for the    and fiscal years 
the irs review may possibly result in a reduction of the cumulative net operating losses million at august  that are currently being carried forward to offset future taxable income 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company estimates future cash flows expected to result from the use and possible disposition of the asset and will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows is less than the carrying amounts of such assets 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
the span of time for which future cash flows are estimated is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
the company considers the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset as determined by discounted cash flows or appraisals  if available 
property held for sale the company also periodically reviews long lived assets against its plans to retain or ultimately dispose of properties 
if the company decides to dispose of a property  it will be moved to property held for sale and actively marketed 
property held for sale is recorded at amounts not in excess of what management currently expects to receive upon sale  less costs of disposal 
the company routinely monitors the estimated value of property held for sale and records adjustments to these values as required 
the company periodically measures and analyzes its estimates against third party appraisals 
insurance and claims the company self insures a significant portion of risks and associated liabilities under its employee injury  workers compensation and general liability programs 
the company maintains insurance coverage with third party carriers to limit its per occurrence claim exposure 
accrued liabilities have been recorded based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates  and is reviewed by the company on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
actual workers compensation and employee injury claims expense may differ from estimated loss provisions 
the company cannot make any assurances as to the ultimate level of claims under the in house safety program or whether declines in incidence of claims as well as claims costs experiences or reductions in reserve requirements under the program will continue in future periods 
stock based compensation the company accounts for its employee stock compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and the related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the company s stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
new accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas  requires pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share for companies not adopting its fair value accounting method for stock based employee compensation 
the pro forma disclosures presented in note employee benefit plans and agreements use the fair value method of sfas to measure compensation expense for stock based employee compensation plans 
page 
table of contents the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 share based payments revised  effective september  among other things  sfas r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation using apb and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation cost in the income statement on their fair values on the date of the grant
