as of march  we were in compliance with all covenants 
we rely primarily on our operating cash flow to support our operations 
over the last three years we generated cash flow from operations of  this operating cash flow is supplemented by our revolving credit facility to meet seasonal financing needs 
we believe our cash flow from operations  available borrowing under our revolving credit facility and existing cash balances will be adequate to satisfy our cash needs for the next twelve months 
the amount of credit available under the facility at any time is based upon a formula applied to our accounts receivable  inventory  real estate  and certain capital equipment 
as of march   we had credit available of  our credit availability and borrowings under the facility fluctuate during the year because of the seasonal nature of our business

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we annually review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see summary of significant accounting policies more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity asset impairment in assessing the recoverability of our fixed assets  goodwill and other non current assets  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows

inventory valuation we review the net realizable value and forecast demand for our products on a quarterly basis to ensure that inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and that obsolete inventory is written off 
factors that could impact forecast demand and selling prices for our products include the timing and success of new product launches  competitor actions  supplier prices and general economic conditions 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results allowance for bad debts and returns we provide an allowance for bad debts and product returns on a monthly basis based upon historical sales  credit and return experience 
the adequacy of these allowances is determined by regularly reviewing accounts receivable and returns and applying historical experience to the current balance with consideration given to the current condition of the economy  assessment of the financial position of our customers as well as past payment history and overall trends in past due accounts and returns 
historically  our allowances have been sufficient for any customer write offs or returns 
although we cannot guarantee future results  management believes its policies and procedures relating to customer exposure are adequate

we maintain a program of selling forward exchange contracts to limit our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies 
all outstanding foreign exchange contracts are marked to market at the end of each accounting period with unrealized gains and losses included in results of operations 
gains or losses on these contracts are offset primarily by the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on the assets  liabilities and underlying transactions 
as of march  we had one outstanding foreign exchange contract entered into with a financial institution to limit our exposure to loss resulting from fluctuations in the value of the euro 
we had an unrealized loss of on this contract as of march   which was recorded during the year 
a appreciation in the value of the euro from the rate at march  would increase the unrealized loss on the outstanding contract to  while a depreciation in the value of the euro would produce an unrealized gain on the contract of
