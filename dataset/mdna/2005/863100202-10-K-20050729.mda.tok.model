item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report of form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ substantially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors including  the cautionary statements set forth under business risk factors 
overview stratos is an innovative international supplier of shielded electronic and optical interconnects  plus the transceiver components that are used to connect these two transmission line mediums 
we design and manufacture interconnect components and subsystems used in telecom communications  datacom  military and video markets for signal networking 
on november   stratos acquired sterling  a privately held company based in mesa  arizona that designs and manufactures rf and microwave interconnect products via its two operating units  trompeter electronics  inc and semflex  inc 
at closing  sterling became a wholly owned subsidiary of stratos  with sterling stockholders receiving  shares of stratos common stock  which represented approximately of stratos total shares outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the merger 
of such amount   shares were placed in escrow to provide indemnification to stratos with respect to certain matters provided for in the merger agreement which shares were released from escrow during the third quarter of fiscal 
stratos common shares issued in this transaction were valued at a share  the closing price on july   the day the merger was announced 
stratos also issued  shares of series b redeemable preferred stock with a face value of million and a contingent value of up to an additional million based on certain events  including the future performance of stratos share price 
the total purchase consideration was million  consisting of common and preferred shares of stratos stock valued at million and million of acquisition related costs 
our financial statements reflect the acquisition of sterling since november  in may  we announced that our board of directors had decided to explore various strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value  including a possible sale of stratos 
after exploring various alternatives  we came to the conclusion in january that the best alternative was to implement a restructuring plan to put stratos on a path to profitability 
in november stratos announced that james w 
mcginley resigned effective that date  as president and chief executive officer and director of stratos 
in addition  stratos announced that brian j 
jackman had resigned as a director of stratos effective the same date 
on march   the term of william t 
comfort  iii expired 
as a result  the board currently has six members 
in december  the board elected phillip a 
harris as president and chief executive officer of stratos 
we are a leading designer  developer and manufacturer of rf and microwave components  active and passive optical  optoelectronic  subsystems and interconnect products used in telecom  enterprise  military and video markets 
we have a rich history of optical and mechanical packaging expertise and have been a pioneer in developing several optical devices using innovative form factors for telecom  datacom  video  military  and harsh environment applications 
we have a broad range of products and a strong intellectual property portfolio of more than patents 
we are a market leader in several niches including specialty optical products such as rj and low rider transceivers  media interface adapters  flex circuits  as well as high performance rf and microwave coax and triax interconnect products 
we currently serve more than  active customers in telecom  military and video markets 
the average unit prices of many of our products generally decrease as the products mature in response to factors such as increased competition  the introduction of new products and increased unit volumes 
we anticipate that average selling prices of many of our products will continue to decline in future periods  although the timing and degree of the declines cannot be predicted with any certainty 
we must continue to develop and introduce new products that incorporate features that can be sold at higher average selling prices  on a timely basis 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to introduce new products to offset the anticipated decrease in the average selling prices of our products 
license fees and royalties represent payments received from licensees of our patented technology  which is also used by us in our optical subsystems 
these license agreements generally provide for up front payments and or future fixed payments or ongoing royalty payments based on a percentage of sales of the licensed products 
the timing and amounts of these payments is beyond our control 
accordingly  the amount received in any given period is expected to vary significantly 
the duration of these license agreements extend generally until the expiration of the licensed patents which range from to we will consider entering into similar agreements in the future  however  we are not able to predict whether we will enter into any additional licenses in the future and  if so  the amount of any license fees or royalties 
our cost of revenues consists of materials  salaries and related expenses for manufacturing personnel and manufacturing overhead 
we purchase several key components used in the manufacture of our products from a limited number of suppliers 
we have periodically experienced shortages and delivery delays for these materials 
in some circumstances  we maintain an inventory of limited source components to decrease the risk of shortage 
if we overestimate our requirements  we may have excess inventory of these components 
the majority of our products are designed and manufactured in our own facilities 
in the future we may expand the volume of products manufactured by third parties 
in order to remain competitive  we must continually reduce our manufacturing costs through design and engineering innovations and increases in manufacturing efficiencies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce our manufacturing costs 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for design engineers  scientists and other technical personnel  depreciation of test and prototyping equipment  and tooling 
research and development expenses also consist of materials and operating expenses related to major product development projects 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
we market and sell our products domestically and internationally through our direct sales force  local resellers and manufacturers representatives 
specifically  we have established relationships with resellers and manufacturers representatives in north america  europe  south america  asia and various other countries 
stratos sells through a network of representatives  distributors  and direct sales professionals primarily across north america  europe  asia  and central america including mexico 
stratos sales teams are organized into three groups including stratos lightwave active and passive optical components and subsystems  trompeter rf interconnects and semflex microwave cable and cable assemblies 
stratos maintains three overlapping sales organizations to focus selling efforts on specific customer types and to capture the strong brand identity each has developed in its respective marketplace 
the marketing group is responsible for developing marketing strategies and programs that support the sale of stratos products and enhance its reputation in the industry 
these strategies and programs include i ongoing interaction with customers for the development of new products and technical support  ii advertising and other promotional activities in industry trade journals and publications targeting design engineers  iii participation in major trade show events and conferences in the communications network industry to promote the company s broad lines of active and passive optical and rf and microwave components and subsystems  iv public relations covering new products and company capabilities  v market research to guide r d investment  vi corporate branding to create a consistent and accurate message across the stratos lightwave  trompeter and semflex brands  and vii interaction with its customers and peers in industry associations to promote and further enhance related technologies  and to validate stratos emerging role as the technology innovator for solutions in our served markets 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including sales commissions  travel costs  outside consulting services  and product marketing and promotion costs 
we expect to continue to make significant expenditures for sales and marketing services 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our administrative and financial groups  as well as legal  accounting  information technology and other professional fees 
we expect to continue to make significant expenditures for general and administrative services 
critical accounting policies accounts receivable we sell products primarily to various oems and distributors 
sales to these customers have varying degrees of collection risk associated with them 
management periodically assesses collection risk and the related allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of accounts  historical experience and the customer s financial condition 
if an account becomes uncollectible  it is charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory reserves it is our policy to reserve of the value of inventory we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excessive to fulfilling future sales estimates 
we define obsolete inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process or items that have potential quality problems 
excess inventory is defined as inventory in excess of one to two years projected usage depending upon the product 
excess inventory is determined using our best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available to us 
in general  our policy is to scrap inventory determined to be obsolete shortly after the determination is made and to keep excess inventory for a reasonable amount of time before it is discarded 
occasionally  changed circumstances in the marketplace present us with an opportunity to sell inventory that was previously determined to be excessive and reserved for 
if this occurs  we vigorously pursue such opportunities 
impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying value of our long lived assets if the facts and circumstances  such as significant declines in sales  earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate suggest that they may be impaired 
if this review indicates that long lived assets will not be recoverable  as determined based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the long lived asset  impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the long lived asset to fair value 
fair value is determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows or appraisals 
if an asset is considered held for sale  we adjust the carrying value of the underlying assets to fair value  as determined based on the estimated net realizable proceeds of the assets 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales  net of trade discounts  is recognized when title passes  which generally occurs upon shipment 
we handle returns by replacing  repairing or issuing credit for defective products when returned 
we establish a reserve for returns based on any known and anticipated returns and accordingly adjust revenue  accounts receivable and inventories 
customer returns it is our policy to establish a reserve for customer returns based on any known returns and anticipated returns based on past experience and accordingly adjust revenue  accounts receivable and inventories 
customer demand is a changing dynamic 
occasionally  we have and will receive requests from customers to accept the return of merchandise for which they had previously accepted delivery 
although we have no obligation to do so  each such request is evaluated in light of contemplated future business from that customer 
we will continue to consider these requests in the future  however  we are not able to predict the amount of any such returns 
the sales of our products do not allow the customer the right of return

excluding the sales attributable to the product lines acquired from sterling  sales increased million in the year ended april  over fiscal our total sales order backlog decreased to million as of april  from million as of april  this decrease reflects a decline in the backlog in most end markets we service  reflecting customer push outs and cancellation of orders  due in part to delays in the launch of new product programs by our customers 
license fees and royalties license fees and royalties decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal license fees consist of payments contingent on sales volume of licensed products 
cost of revenues and gross margins cost of revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of total revenues  or gross margin  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase results from higher profit margins in our product lines acquired in the sterling acquisition that were not fully reflected in the prior fiscal year because the date of acquisition was november  in addition  the increase in sales and the reduction in fixed overhead and other manufacturing costs as a result of restructuring activities  had a positive effect on the gross margin in fiscal a decrease of million in the charge for obsolete and slow moving inventory in fiscal compared to fiscal and the sale in fiscal of million of inventory that was previously considered excess and fully reserved  were each a contributing factor to the increase in gross margin in fiscal cost of sales was charged approximately million and million in fiscal and  to increase the reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the million increase was the result of a million increase in the cost of research and development facilities and million increase in personnel costs dedicated to research and development offset partially by a million decrease in material and overhead cost related to major product development 
the above amounts include million and million of research and development expenses in fiscal years and  respectively  attributable to the product lines acquired from sterling 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due to an increase of million in sales and marketing salaries  fringe benefits  bonuses and commissions 
the above amounts include million and million of sales and marketing expenses for fiscal years and  respectively  attributable to the product lines acquired from sterling

the above amounts include million and million of general and administration expenses in fiscal years and respectively  attributable to the product lines acquired from sterling 
restructuring and other charges during fiscal years and  we recorded restructuring and other charges related to the consolidation and elimination of various operating activities 
such charges included personnel severance expenses  lease expenses for limited use facilities  and write down of the values of certain assets related to the restructuring of operations 
on january   we announced that we had concluded the process initiated in may to explore various strategic alternatives for stratos to maximize shareholder value and that we had adopted broad company wide plans to enhance out strategic and operational direction 
as part of the plans  we terminated employees  primarily administrative personnel  to allow us to compete more effectively in our markets and to create a cost structure more in line with the current level of our business 
as a result  we recorded million in restructuring charges in fiscal  of which  million related to personnel and severance costs and million related to the lease obligation for a limited use facility that we have been unable to sub lease through the end of its lease term in we completed the workforce reduction during our third quarter of fiscal during fiscal year  we terminated employees including both production and administrative personnel and recorded million in restructuring charges in accordance with the restructuring plan adopted in fiscal the million consisted of million related to personnel and severance costs  million related to the write down of the values of certain assets  million related to idle facilities and million of other costs related to the restructuring of operations 
litigation settlements  net stratos has recorded million and million of net litigation settlement income in fiscal years and respectively 
in fiscal  stratos received million in net settlements of several patent infringement cases 
this amount was partially offset by million in settlements paid by stratos related to outstanding litigation 
the settlement amount was disbursed in fiscal gain on sale of business effective may   we sold the assets and business of our wholly owned subsidiary  bandwidth semiconductor llc  located in hudson  new hampshire  realizing a net gain of approximately million in fiscal year the bandwidth business was not a separate business segment or considered a discontinued operation given the nature of its operations 
investment income  net investment income  net of investment expense  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal investment income consists of earnings on the short term investment of excess cash balances and the decrease of this income in fiscal reflects the reduction of excess cash balances 
other income other income in fiscal and principally represents unrealized foreign exchange gains on intercompany loans recorded in our operations in the united kingdom 
income taxes through april  we had recorded a valuation allowance of million against deferred income tax assets primarily associated with tax loss carry forwards  because the significant operating losses experienced in recent years establishes a presumption that realization of these income tax benefits does not meet a more likely than not standard 
we continued to experience operating losses during fiscal year  and an additional valuation allowance of million was recorded  which eliminated the tax benefit attributable to the net loss incurred in fiscal year we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million 
we believe that our acquisition of sterling holding company in november triggered internal revenue code section limitations on the net operating loss that existed prior to the acquisition  which was approximately million 
of that amount  we believe the available utilization of the net operating loss is limited to approximately million on an annual basis

these increases were offset in part by a million decrease of net sales into the storage end market 
included in the fiscal amounts above are million in sales from product lines acquired in the merger with sterling 
excluding the sales attributable to the product lines acquired from sterling  sales decreased million in the year ended april  over fiscal the decrease in sales was primarily due to lower customer demand due to the current economic climate and reduced capital spending for optical networking equipment 
sales were also negatively impacted by declines in average unit prices for our products resulting from pricing pressure and changes in product mix 
our total sales order backlog increased to million as of april  from million as of april  this increase reflected a significant increase in the backlog in our military governmental end market and million from the merger with sterling 
license fees and royalties 
license fees and royalties decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal license fees consist of both fixed schedule payments and contingent payments based on sales volumes of licensed products 
cost of revenues and gross margins cost of revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of total revenues  or gross margin  increased to in fiscal from negative in fiscal this increase results from higher profit margins in our product lines acquired in the sterling acquisition that were not reflected in the prior fiscal year because the date of acquisition was november  in addition  the increase in sales and the reduction in fixed overhead and other manufacturing costs as a result of restructuring activities had a positive effect on the gross margin in fiscal a decrease of million in the charge for obsolete and slow moving inventory in fiscal compared to fiscal and the sale in fiscal of million of inventory that was previously considered excess and fully reserved  were each a contributing factor to the increase in gross margin in fiscal research and development research and development expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the million decrease was due to a reduction of million in costs of research and development facilities  million decrease in personnel costs dedicated to research and development and million decrease in material and overhead cost related to major product development

cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle effective may   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and performed a transitional goodwill impairment test as of that date 
as a result  we determined that the goodwill of our active optical subsystems reporting unit had been impaired and we recorded a one time non cash charge of approximately million 
this charge was recorded as of may  and is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the statement of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this filing for further discussion of this item 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities totaled million  million and million for fiscal years  and respectively 
the use of cash in operating activities for fiscal resulted primarily from the net loss  and increases in accounts receivable and inventories offset in part by decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the use of cash in operating activities for fiscal resulted primarily from the net loss and increase in inventories offset in part by the decrease in accounts receivable  other assets and the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the use of cash in operating activities in fiscal resulted primarily from the net loss  an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset in part by decreases in accounts receivable and inventories 
we operate in markets that have experienced a severe economic downturn several years ago and as a result  many of our customers may  from time to time  stretch their payment terms 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days at april  compared to days at april  net cash provided by investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these amounts reflect the net proceeds from the sale of short term investments  the proceeds from the sale of assets  and in fiscal  million cash acquired in the merger with sterling net of acquisition expenses  offset in part by the purchases of equipment and facilities in all fiscal years 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal represents million of repayments of long term borrowings  and million of dividends on preferred stock  offset in part by million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal represents million repayments of long term borrowings  a million distribution to the former owners of sterling to satisfy a liability assumed in the acquisition  million in treasury stock transactions and million of dividends on preferred stock  offset in part by million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal represents repayments of long term borrowings 
as of april   our principal source of liquidity was approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we have implemented personnel reductions  shut down certain facilities  disposed of certain assets and put in place other cost reduction programs 
however  since many of our costs are fixed in the near term  we expect to continue to incur significant manufacturing  research and development  sales and marketing and administrative expenses 
consequently  we will need to generate higher revenues while containing costs and operating expenses if we are to return to profitability 
if our efforts to increase our revenues and contain our costs are not successful  we will continue to incur net losses 
we are also examining and pursuing opportunities for improving gross margins and cash flows 
the merger with sterling combined two companies with brands that are well respected by segments of the telecommunications  military  video and broadcast customer base  that seek solutions to difficult problems at the electrical side of the high performance  high bandwidth interface  which are solved by our products 
we believe that these products  when combined with superior customer service  provide the potential for improving gross margins and cash flows 
accordingly  we are examining the requirements of our customers and the broader potential customer base where our core competencies could provide value to customers in an enduring and profitable way 
we are also focused on improving customer service through better execution of delivery  support and cycle time  particularly for specialty products to those customers who value and will pay for this service 
we seek to create a customer responsive organization that executes on demand and stands behind its customers strategy 
there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to generate increased sales and our ability to manage operating expenses 
the continued diversification of our end markets and expansion of our product offerings through internal and  possibly  external growth could materially change our level of cash and cash equivalents 
this diversification may require us to seek equity or debt financing 
our cash commitments are i the repayment of the current portion of our long term debt in the amount of approximately million during the coming year and ii the payment of cumulative cash dividends on the series b preferred stock on terms specified in the certificate of designation for such stock  in the amount of approximately million annually 
also  we are obligated to redeem all shares of series b preferred stock in accordance with the terms of the certificate of designation for such stock no later than days following the occurrence of certain events relating to the achievement of million in annual revenue or million in market capitalization 
in addition  in the event of a change of control  the series b preferred stock becomes redeemable for an aggregate of million  subject to upward adjustment under certain circumstances relating to market price of our common stock 
we believe that our current cash balances will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures  the series b preferred stock dividend and repayments of borrowings for the next months 
stratos contractual obligations as of april  are as follows payment due by period in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total off balance sheet arrangements we are not party to any transactions  arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
we have no exposures to off balance sheet arrangements  no special purpose entities  and no activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
business risk factors we have incurred significant net losses  primarily due to the current economic climate in the communications industry 
unless we are able to increase our sales or further reduce our costs  we will continue to incur net losses 
the current economic climate in the communications industry has resulted in reduced capital spending from its peak for networking products 
spending for networking products appears to have stabilized and may see a rebound  although it is not expected to return to peak levels for the foreseeable future 
as a result  many of our customers continue to express uncertainty as to their future requirements 
while we have experienced a significant increase in net sales  we nevertheless incurred a net loss during fiscal year the increase in net sales is largely the result of the acquisition of sterling and a million increase in net sales into the military governmental end market 
we do not expect continued substantial growth in the markets we serve 
any decline in demand for our customers products or a deterioration of general economic conditions in the communications industry would likely result in reduction in demand for our products and our business  operating results and financial condition would suffer 
although we have implemented personnel reductions and other cost reduction programs  many of our costs are fixed in the near term 
consequently  we will need to generate higher revenues while containing costs and operating expenses if we are to return to profitability 
if our efforts to increase our revenues and contain our costs are not successful  we will continue to incur net losses 
our success depends on the long term growth of the communications industry and its use of our technologies 
if these events do not occur  our net sales may decline and our business would likely be significantly harmed 
our subsystems and components are used primarily in military  video broadcast  industrial  enterprise  metropolitan area  wide area and telecommunication networks 
these markets are rapidly evolving and it is difficult to predict their potential size or future growth rate 
in addition  there is uncertainty as to the extent to which communications technologies will be used throughout these markets 
our success in generating revenue in these markets will depend on the long term growth of these markets and their use of communications technologies 
if these markets do not grow  or if the use of communications technologies in these markets does not expand  our net sales may decline and our business would likely be significantly harmed 
the market for communications equipment is changing rapidly and is dominated by several large manufacturers 
our future growth will depend  in part  upon our ability to develop and introduce new products for this market and the growth of the communications equipment market and our ability to compete successfully in the communications industry 
the growth in the market for communications equipment products and services is dependent on a number of factors  including without limitation the amount of capital expenditures by network providers regulatory and legal developments changes to capital expenditure rates by network providers the addition of new customers to the market end user demand for integrated internet  data  video  voice and other network services we cannot predict the growth rate of the market for telecommunications equipment products and services 
the economic climate in the communications industry  changes and consolidation in the service provider market and constraints on capital availability have had a material adverse effect on many of our service provider customers  causing some of these customers to go out of business and a number of other customers to substantially reduce their expansion plans and purchases 
we must develop new products and technologies as well as enhancements to existing products and technologies in order to remain competitive 
if we fail to do so  our products will no longer be competitive and our net sales will decline 
the market for our products and technologies is characterized by rapid technological change  new and improved product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
our future success will depend to a substantial extent on our ability to develop  introduce and support new products and technologies on a successful and timely basis 
if we fail to develop and deploy new products and technologies or enhancements of existing products on a successful and timely basis or we experience delays in the development  introduction or enhancement of our products and technologies  our products will no longer be competitive and our net sales will decline 
the introduction of new and enhanced products may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for existing products 
in addition  a slowdown in demand for existing products ahead of a new product introduction could result in a write down in the value of inventories relating to existing products 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may not be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new or enhanced products successfully  if at all  or on a timely basis 
further  our new products may be unable to gain market acceptance and we may not be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors  technological changes or emerging industry standards 
any failure to respond to technological change would significantly harm our business 
our products are incorporated into larger systems  which must comply with various domestic and international government regulations 
if the performance of our products adversely affects our customers ability to comply with these requirements  we may lose these customers and our net sales will decline 
our products are incorporated into larger systems  which must comply with various regulations and standards established by different countries  which may vary considerably 
if the performance of our products contributes to our customers inability to comply with existing or evolving standards established by regulatory authorities or to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals  we may lose these customers and our net sales will decline 
if our products fail to comply with evolving industry standards or alternative technologies in our markets  we may be required to make significant expenditures to redesign our products 
our products comprise only a part of an entire networking system and must comply with evolving industry standards in order to gain market acceptance 
in many cases  we introduce a product before an industry standard has become widely accepted and we depend on the companies that provide other components to support industry standards as they evolve 
because industry standards do not exist in some cases at the time we are developing new products  we may develop products that do not comply with the eventual industry standard 
if this occurs  we would need to redesign our products to comply with adopted industry standards 
in addition  if alternative technologies were adopted as an industry standard within our target markets  we would have to dedicate significant time and resources to redesign our products to meet this new industry standard 
if we are required to redesign our products  we may incur significant expenses and losses due to lack of customer demand  unusable purchased components for these products and the diversion of our engineers from future product development efforts 
if we are not successful in redesigning our products or developing new products to meet new standards or any other standard that may emerge  our net sales will decline 
we are also dependent on sales to the military aerospace industry  including us and foreign government entities 
approximately of our sales for the fiscal year came from direct and indirect sales to the military aerospace industry  which is heavily dependent on sales to us and foreign government entities  either directly through contracts with such entities or indirectly through distributors and to prime contractors or subcontractors who are building systems or subsystems for them 
a significant decline in us and foreign government expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our sales 
our sales cycle runs from our customers initial design to production for commercial sale 
this cycle is long and unpredictable and may cause our net sales to decline or our operating expenses to increase 
because of the length of our sales cycles  are ability to accurately predict the timing of our sales is limited 
as a result  if sales forecasts from specific customers are not realized  we may be unable to compensate for the sales shortfall and our net sales may decline 
the period of time between our initial contact with a customer and the receipt of a purchase order may span over a year or more  and varies by product and customer 
during this time  customers may perform  or require us to perform extensive evaluation and qualification testing of our products 
generally  they consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase our products  including ability to interoperate with other subsystems and components  product performance and reliability 
we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort while our potential customers are qualifying our products 
even after incurring these costs  we ultimately may not sell any or may only sell small amounts of our products to these potential customers 
consequently  if new sales do not result from our efforts to qualify our products  our operating expenses will increase 
our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time and may cancel or defer purchases on short notice  which may cause our net sales to decline or increase our operating expenses 
we generally do not have long term contracts with our customers 
sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders  often with short lead times  that may be canceled or deferred by customers on short notice without significant penalty 
our customers base their orders for our products on the forecasted sales and manufacturing schedules for their own products 
our customers have in the past significantly accelerated  canceled or delayed orders for our products in response to unanticipated changes in the manufacturing schedules for their own products  and will likely do so again in the future 
if we do not decrease our manufacturing costs or increase sales of higher margin products as the average unit price of our existing products decreases  our gross margins will decline 
the average unit prices of our products frequently decrease as the products mature in response to increased competition  the introduction of new products and increased unit volumes 
most of our products are designed and manufactured in our own facilities 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of sales is fixed over the near term 
in order to remain competitive  we must continually reduce our manufacturing costs through design and engineering changes and increases in manufacturing efficiencies 
we must also continue to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products that incorporate features that can be sold at higher average selling prices 
our inability to reduce manufacturing costs or introduce new products with higher average selling prices will cause our gross margins to decline  which would significantly harm our operating results 
the market for our products is highly competitive  which may result in lost sales or lower gross margins 
the market for our products is highly competitive 
for optoelectronics  we compete primarily with agilent technologies  inc  finisar corporation  jds uniphase corporation and optical communications products  inc for fiber optics  we compete primarily with amphenol corporation  molex  inc and tyco international  ltd 
and numerous other smaller companies 
for rf products we compete with adc telecommunications  inc  amphenol  itt cannon a subsidiary of itt industries  kings electronics co  inc  radiall  sa and numerous other companies globally 
in the microwave products business  we compete with huber suhner  wl gore associates  inc and a large number of smaller companies 
many of these companies have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources and brand name recognition than we have 
as a result  these competitors are able to devote greater resources than we can to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
in addition  several of our competitors have large market capitalizations or cash reserves and are much better positioned than we are to acquire other companies in order to gain new technologies or products 
many of our competitors have much greater name recognition  more extensive customer bases  better developed distribution channels and broader product offerings than we do 
these companies may leverage their customer bases and broader product offerings and adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
in addition  companies with diversified product offerings can better sustain an economic downturn 
we expect that more companies  including some of our customers  will enter the markets for our products 
we may not be able to compete successfully against either current or future competitors 
competitive pressures  combined with weakening demand  may result in further price reductions  lower margins and loss of market share 
in addition  some of our current and potential customers are attempting to integrate their operations by producing their own subsystems or components or acquiring one or more of our competitors  which may eliminate the need to purchase our products 
furthermore  larger companies in other related industries are developing and acquiring technologies and applying their significant resources  including their distribution channels and brand name recognition  in an effort to capture significant market share 
while this trend has not historically impacted our competitive position  it may result in future decreases in our net sales 
further  we manufacture many of our products in the united states and the united kingdom 
our manufacturing costs are higher than the manufacturing costs of some of our competitors  particularly those located in foreign countries that benefit from lower priced labor and government subsidies 
if our current or potential future customers decide to purchase products from these lower cost competitors  we could suffer a significant decline in our sales  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we depend on suppliers for several key components 
if we underestimate or overestimate our requirements for these components  our business could be significantly harmed 
we purchase several key components that are incorporated into our products from a limited number of suppliers 
we have experienced shortages and delays in obtaining key components in the past and expect to experience shortages and delays in the future 
these shortages and delays have typically occurred when demand within the industry has increased rapidly and exceeded the capacity of suppliers of key components in the short term 
delays and shortages also often occur in the early stages of a product s life cycle 
the length of shortages and delays in the past has varied from several days to a month 
we are unable to predict the length of any future shortages or delays 
some of our critical components used in production of certain of our products are purchased from a key supplier  which has been acquired by one of our competitors 
if this supplier increases prices  reduces quantities available to us or ceases to supply us  our business and results of operations may be significantly harmed 
the inability to obtain sufficient quantities of these components that meet our quality requirements may interrupt and delay the manufacturing of our products or result in the cancellation of orders for our products 
in addition  our suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of these components at any time 
we may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion  or at all 
any transition to alternative suppliers may result in delays in shipment and increased expenses and may limit our ability to deliver products to our customers 
furthermore  if we are unable to identify an alternative source of supply  we may have to redesign or modify our products  which may cause delays in shipments  increased design and manufacturing costs and increased prices for our products 
we make forecasts for our component requirements based on anticipated product orders 
although from time to time we enter into long term agreements for the purchase of key components  our purchases of key components are generally made on a purchase order basis 
we may also maintain an inventory of limited source components to limit the potential impact of a component shortage 
we may not accurately predict the demand for our products and the lead time required to obtain key components 
if we overestimate our requirements  we may have excess inventory  which may become obsolete and would increase our costs 
if we underestimate our requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing and delay delivery of our products to our customers 
either of these occurrences would significantly harm our business 
our success depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel  and if we are unable to do so  our product development efforts and customer relations will suffer 
our products require sophisticated manufacturing  research and development  marketing and sales  and technical support 
our success depends on our ability to attract  train and retain qualified technical personnel in each of these areas 
competition for personnel in all of these areas is intense and we may not be able to hire or retain sufficient personnel to achieve our goals or support the anticipated growth in our business 
the market for the highly trained personnel we require is very competitive  due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products and technology 
if we fail to hire and retain qualified personnel  our product development efforts and customer relations will suffer 
our products may contain defects  which may cause us to incur significant costs  divert our attention from product development efforts and result in a loss of customers 
our products are complex and may contain defects  particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released 
our customers integrate our subsystems and components into systems and products that they develop themselves or acquire from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur in equipment or systems into which our products have been incorporated  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
we may be subject to liability claims for damages related to product defects or experience manufacturing delays as a result of these defects in the future  any or all of which could be substantial 
the length of any future manufacturing delays in connection with a product defect will depend on the nature of the defect  and whether we or one of our component suppliers was the source of the defect 
moreover  the occurrence of defects  whether caused by our products or technology or the products of another vendor  may result in significant customer relations problems and injury to our reputation and may impair the market acceptance of our products and technologies 
we are subject to environmental laws and other legal requirements that have the potential to subject us to substantial liability and increase our costs of doing business 
our properties and business operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental  health and safety laws and other legal requirements  including those relating to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous substances used in our manufacturing processes 
these legal requirements may impose on us the need for additional capital expenditures or other requirements 
if we fail to obtain required permits or otherwise fail to operate within these or future legal requirements  we may be required to pay substantial penalties  suspend our operations or make costly changes to our manufacturing processes or facilities 
although we believe that we are in compliance and have complied with all applicable legal requirements  we may also be required to incur additional costs to comply with current or future legal requirements 
economic  political and regulatory risks associated with international operations may limit our sales and increase our costs of doing business abroad 
a significant portion of our sales is generated from customers located outside the united states  principally in europe 
we also operate a manufacturing facility in the united kingdom 
sales to customers located outside of the united states were approximately of our net sales during fiscal year and approximately of our net sales during fiscal year  which only reflected sales from sterling  after november th  our international operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including difficulties in managing operations in different locations changes in foreign currency rates longer accounts receivable collection cycles difficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems seasonal reductions in business activities in some parts of the world  such as during the summer months in europe trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions potentially adverse tax consequences rights in some foreign countries the potential difficulty in enforcing intellectual property acts of terrorism directed against the united states or us affiliated targets these  and other factors could adversely impact our international sales or increase our costs of doing business abroad or impair our ability to expand into international markets  and therefore could significantly harm our business 
we may pursue additional acquisitions 
if we are unable to successfully integrate any businesses or technologies that we acquire in the future or are unable to realize the intended benefits of any future acquisitions  our business will be harmed 
as part of our strategy  we may pursue opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products  expand our markets or enhance our technical capabilities  or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
our experience in acquiring other businesses and technologies is limited 
acquisitions could result in a number of financial consequences  including use of significant amounts of cash the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities large one time write offs amortization expenses related to intangible assets acquisitions also involve numerous operational risks  including difficulties in integrating operations  products  technologies and personnel unanticipated costs or write offs associated with the acquisition diversion of management s attention from other business concerns diversion of capital and other resources from our existing businesses potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations if we are unable to successfully integrate other businesses or technologies that we may acquire in the future or are unable to realize the intended benefits of any future acquisitions  our business will be harmed 
our inability to protect our intellectual property rights would significantly impair their value and our competitive position 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
although we have numerous issued patents and pending patent applications  we cannot be sure that any patents will be issued as a result of our pending patent applications or  if issued  that any patent claim allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  we cannot be sure that any existing or future patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that any right granted thereunder would provide us with meaningful protection of our technology 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property or to take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
policing unauthorized use of our products and technology is difficult 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
further  enforcing our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and the success of these efforts cannot be predicted with certainty 
litigation has been necessary and may continue to be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights 
such litigation could be costly and its outcome cannot be predicted with certainty 
our inability to adequately protect against unauthorized use of our intellectual property would significantly impair its value and our competitive position 
various litigation matters  in which we are defendants  could result in significant monetary damages and expenses or restrictions on our ability to sell our products 
we are involved in various litigation matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
our annual reports on form k and quarterly reports on form q describe certain matters  in which we are defendants 
see discussion under part i  item legal proceedings above 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
from time to time  third parties may assert patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies used in our business 
in addition  our rights to use our name or other trademarks are subject to challenge by others 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
if we are unsuccessful in defending ourselves against such claims  we could be subject to significant monetary damages and may be required to do one or more of the following stop using the challenged technology or selling our products that use or incorporate such technology  attempt to obtain a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  attempt to license a substitute technology on reasonable terms or redesign the applicable products to avoid infringement 
in the event a claim against us were successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement  our business would be significantly harmed 
risks relating to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock the market prices for securities of technology related companies have been volatile in recent years and our stock price could fluctuate significantly 
our common stock has been publicly traded only since june  the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations since the date of our initial public offering 
these fluctuations could continue 
factors that could affect our stock price include economic and stock market conditions generally and specifically as they may impact participants in the communications industry earnings and other announcements by  and changes in market evaluations of  participants in the communications industry changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts following our stock announcements or implementation by us or our competitors of technical innovations or new products  and strategic moves by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions in addition  the securities of many companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years  often unrelated to the companies operating performance 
specifically  market prices for securities of technology related companies have frequently reached elevated levels  often following their initial public offerings 
these levels may not be sustainable and may not bear any relationship to these companies operating performances 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law and our shareholder rights plan may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company  which could decrease the value of the shares of our common stock 
our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include the authority of our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders 
in addition  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan designed to protect stratos and its shareholders from unfair or coercive takeover tactics  that is similar to stockholder rights plans adopted by many other companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and interest rates 
although our stratos uk subsidiary enters into transactions in currencies other than its functional currency  the pound sterling  foreign currency exposures arising from these transactions are not material to us 
the primary foreign currency exposure arises from the translation of our net equity investment in our foreign subsidiary to us dollars 
we view our investment in our foreign subsidiary as long term 
the primary currency to which we are exposed is the pound sterling 
we do not have exposure to interest rate risk related to our debt obligation because the interest rate is fixed 
our market risks include lower income from our short term investments if interest rates decline
