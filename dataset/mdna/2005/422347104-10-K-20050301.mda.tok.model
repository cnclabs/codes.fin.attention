item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview heartland express  inc is a short to medium haul truckload carrier 
the company transports freight for major shippers and generally earns revenue based on the number of miles per load delivered 
during  freight revenue  excluding fuel surcharge  increased to million from million in the company takes pride in the quality of the service that it provides to its customers 
the keys to maintaining a high level of service are reliable equipment and equipment availability 
during the company purchased million in revenue equipment 
these purchases were financed through cash generated by operating activities  and the company expects future revenue equipment purchases to be financed using current cash and investment balances and cash flow provided by future operations 
the company continues to work with shippers and drivers to minimize the impact of the revised dot hours of service regulations that took effect on january  these revised regulations have had minimal effect on our operations to date primarily due to proper planning and customer cooperation 
on july   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia issued a decision vacating the new hours of service regulations because of concerns for driver health and safety 
on september  the extension of the federal highway bill signed by the president extended the current hours of service rules for one year or whenever the fmcsa develops a new set of regulations  whichever comes first 
the fmcsa will continue to enforce hours of service regulations during this period 
the course of action by the fmcsa is unknown at this time 
in addition to the revised hours of service regulations  the trucking industry is experiencing a shortage of qualified drivers 
in order to attract and retain experienced drivers  the company increased pay for all drivers by per mile during the first quarter of effective october   the company began paying all drivers an additional per mile for miles driven in the upper northeastern united states 
effective the first quarter of  the company will increase driver pay an additional per mile 
the and the first quarter driver pay increases will increase driver pay approximately over the period 
management believes that the company continues to offer one of the highest pay packages in the industry 
this pay package along with increased recruiting efforts should allow the company to attract qualified drivers  however  a long term shortage of drivers could hinder growth 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company s management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
the company has identified certain accounting policies  described below  that are the most important to the portrayal of the company s current financial condition and results of operations 
the company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in item note  significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect the financial statements include the following revenue is recognized when freight is delivered 
selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers are and years  respectively 
estimates of salvage value are based upon the expected market values of equipment at the end of the expected useful life 
management estimates accruals for the self insured portion of pending accident liability  workers compensation  physical damage and cargo damage claims 
these accruals are based upon individual case estimates  including reserve development  and estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past experience 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
these factors may significantly impact the company s results of operations from period to period

liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business requires significant investments in new revenue equipment 
historically the company has been debt free  funding revenue equipment purchases with cash flow provided by operations 
the company also obtains tractor capacity by utilizing independent contractors  who provide a tractor and bear all associated operating and financing expenses 
the company s primary source of liquidity for the year ended december   was net cash provided by operating activities of million compared to million in the corresponding period 
capital expenditures for property and equipment  net of trade ins  totaled million for the year during compared to million during capital expenditures for revenue equipment  net of trades  are expected to be approximately million in the company paid cash dividends of million in compared to million in the company began paying cash dividends in the third quarter of management believes the company has adequate liquidity to meet its current and projected needs

the company ended the year with million in cash  cash equivalents  and investments and no debt 
based on the company s strong financial position  management believes outside financing could be obtained  if necessary  to fund capital expenditures 
factors that may affect future results the company s future results may be affected by a number of factors over which the company has little or no control 
fuel prices  insurance and claims costs  liability claims  interest rates  the availability of drivers  fluctuations in the resale value of revenue equipment  economic and customer business cycles and shipping demands are economic factors over which the company has little or no control 
significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  interest rates or insurance and claims costs  to the extent not offset by increases in freight rates  and the resale value of revenue equipment could reduce the company s profitability 
weakness in the general economy  including a weakness in consumer demand for goods and services  could adversely affect the company s customers and the company s growth and revenues  if customers reduce their demand for transportation services 
customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss  and the company may be required to increase its reserve for bad debt losses 
weakness in customer demand for the company s services or in the general rate environment may also restrain the company s ability to increase rates or obtain fuel surcharges 
inflation and fuel cost most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to the drivers 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
the company historically has limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect profitability 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company historically has been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and operating taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  shorter term increases are not fully recovered 
fuel prices have remained high throughout most of   and  thus increasing our cost of operations 
in addition to the increased fuel costs  the reduced fuel efficiency of the new engines will put additional pressure on profitability due to increased fuel consumption 
competitive conditions in the transportation industry  such as lower demand for transportation services  could affect the company s ability to obtain rate increases or fuel surcharges 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  as of december  the company has no debt outstanding 
commitments expiration by period total less than year years purchase obligations    operating lease obligations   standby letters of credit   total    the purchase obligations reflect the total purchase price  net of trade in values  for tractors scheduled for delivery through december these purchases are expected to be financed by existing cash and investment balances  and with cash flows from operations 
the operating lease obligation is for the company s corporate offices and expires may  the lease contains a five year renewal option 
the standby letters of credit are primarily required for self insurance purposes and there are no balances outstanding on the letters of credit 
the company has no contractual obligations extending beyond december  forward looking statements and risk factors statements in this report that are not reported financial results or other historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on present information the company has related to its existing business circumstances and involve a number of business risks and uncertainties  any of which could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements 
further  investors are cautioned that the company does not assume any obligation to update forward looking statements based on unanticipated events or changed expectations 
in addition to specific factors that may be described in connection with any particular forward looking statement  the following factors could cause actual results to differ materially 
growth with existing customers and the ability to solicit new business is dependent upon the company s ability to provide on time service and certain economic factors 
weakness in the economy  including decreased consumer demand  could adversely affect the demand for the company s transportation services and future growth 
the ability to negotiate increased freight rates to offset effects of inflation and cost increases is also dependent upon the state of the economy to a certain extent 
the company may also be affected by the financial failure of existing customers resulting in fewer shipments or potential bad debt write offs 
an extended period of economic downturn could also enhance revenue growth because of industry consolidation 
the truckload industry is highly competitive with an abundance of trucking companies  both profitable and marginal 
the business failures of the marginal competition may result in increased opportunities for the financially strong 
the company generates a significant amount of its revenues from a few major customers 
for the year ended december   the company s top customers accounted for of its revenue 
a reduction or a termination of business with a major customer could have a material adverse effect on financial results 
the availability and cost of petroleum are affected by worldwide political  economic  and market factors that are beyond our control 
shortages of fuel and the resulting increase in the price of diesel can have an adverse impact on operations and profitability 
the company s operating results are negatively impacted to the extent that high fuel costs cannot be recovered through customer fuel surcharge agreements 
the company is subject to regulation by the dot  epa  and various other federal and state authorities 
new or more comprehensive regulations pertaining to fuel emissions  driver hours of service  or other mandated regulation could result in increased cost of operations 
in addition  increased taxes and operating fees mandated by federal and state taxing authorities can have an adverse effect on profitability 
effective october   epa emissions control regulations require that newly manufactured diesel engines must satisfy considerably more restrictive emissions standards 
additional changes to engine design requirements will take effect in the costs of compliance with the epa engine design requirements have significantly increased new equipment prices and further increases may result in connection with the implementation of the standards 
in addition  the epa compliant engines are less fuel efficient 
to the extent we are unable to offset increased expenses associated with the epa mandate with rate increases or cost savings  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company s operation is highly dependent on the hiring and retention of experienced drivers with safe driving records 
there has been a shortage of qualified drivers and independent contractors over the past several years 
the availability of independent contractors has declined due to high fuel prices and the decreased availability of tractor financing 
the company expects that the hiring of qualified drivers will remain competitive 
a shortage of qualified drivers and independent contractors for an extended period of time could effect the growth and operating results of the company 
the company increased driver compensation the first quarter of and is implementing a comparable increase in the first quarter of in the fourth quarter of the company increased driver pay for miles driven in the upper northeastern united states 
increases in driver compensation could adversely affect our earnings if not offset by corresponding increases in freight rates 
the company is a party to ordinary  routine litigation and administrative proceedings incidental to its business 
these proceedings primarily involve claims for personal injury  property damage  and workers compensation incurred in connection with the transportation of freight 
the company maintains insurance to cover liabilities arising from the transportation of freight for amounts in excess of certain self insured retentions 
claims in excess of these retentions are covered by premium based policies to levels that management considers adequate 
in recent years the cost of insurance in the industry has increased dramatically due to increased claims and economic conditions 
the company s current insurance policies expire in increases in premiums and self retention levels could impact the results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements see note of the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial position
