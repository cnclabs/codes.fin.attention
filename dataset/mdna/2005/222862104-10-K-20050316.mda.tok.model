federal regulation health insurance portability and accountability act of the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa imposes requirements relating to a variety of issues that affect the company s business  including the privacy and security of medical information  limits on exclusions based on preexisting conditions for certain plans  guaranteed renewability of health care coverage for most employers and individuals and administrative simplification procedures involving the standardization of transactions and the establishment of uniform health care provider  payor and employer identifiers 
various agencies of the federal government have issued regulations to implement certain sections of hipaa 
for example  the department of health and human services issued a final rule that establishes the standard data content and format for the electronic submission of claims and other administrative health transactions 
we are compliant with the electronic data standards established by the final rule 
further  the department of health and human services has issued a final privacy rule that applies to individually identifiable health information 
the primary purposes of the privacy rule are to protect and enhance the rights of consumers by providing them access to their health information and controlling the inappropriate use of that information  and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health care delivery by creating a national framework for health privacy protection that builds on efforts by states  health systems  individual organizations and individuals 
we are compliant with the final rule 
on january   the us department of labor s pension and welfare benefits administration  the irs and the department of health and human services issued two regulations that provide guidance on the nondiscrimination provisions under the hipaa as they relate to health factors and wellness programs 
these nondiscrimination provisions prohibit a group health plan or group health insurance issuer from denying an individual eligibility for benefits or charging an individual a higher premium based on a health factor 
we currently do not believe that these regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business 
on february   the department of health and human services issued its final rule for security standards under the hipaa 
this rule establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic individually identifiable health information 
the compliance date for the security standards rule is april  we have implemented a plan of action to achieve compliance with the final security standards rule by the compliance date 
employee retirement income security act of the provision of services to certain employee health benefit plans is subject to the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
erisa regulates certain aspects of the relationships between us and employers who maintain employee benefit plans subject to erisa 
some of our administrative services and other activities may also be subject to regulation under erisa 
in addition  some states require licensure or registration of companies providing third party claims administration services for benefit plans 
we provide a variety of products and services to employee benefit plans that are covered by erisa 
the us department of labor adopted federal regulations that establish claims procedures for employee benefit plans under erisa insured and self insured 
the regulations shorten the time allowed for health and disability plans to respond to claims and appeals  establishes requirements for plan responses to appeals and expands required disclosures to participants and beneficiaries 
these regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our business 
medicare and medicaid some of our health plans contract with the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to provide services to medicare beneficiaries pursuant to the medicare program 
some of our health plans also contract with states to provide health benefits to medicaid recipients 
as a result  we are subject to extensive federal and state regulations 
cms may audit any health plan operating under a medicare contract to determine the plan s compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations 

table of contents cms and the appropriate state regulatory agency have the right to audit any health plan operating under a medicaid managed care contract to determine the plan s compliance with state and federal law 
in some instances  states engage peer review organizations to perform quality assurance and utilization review oversight of medicaid managed care plans 
our health plans are required to abide by the peer review organizations standards 
cms rules require medicaid managed care plans to have beneficiary protections and protect the rights of participants in the medicaid program 
specifically  states must assure continuous access to care for beneficiaries with ongoing health care needs who transfer from one health plan to another 
states and plans must identify enrollees with special health care needs and assess the quality and appropriateness of their care 
these requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our business 
the federal anti kickback statute imposes criminal and civil penalties for paying or receiving remuneration which is deemed to include a kickback  bribe or rebate in connection with any federal health care program  including the medicare  medicaid and federal employees health benefits programs 
the law and related regulations have been interpreted to prohibit the payment  solicitation  offering or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for the referral of federal health care program patients or any item or service that is reimbursed  in whole or in part  by any federal health care program 
similar anti kickback provisions have been adopted by many states  which apply regardless of the source of reimbursement 
with respect to the federal anti kickback statute  there exists a statutory exception and two safe harbors addressing certain risk sharing arrangements 
a safe harbor is a regulation that describes relationships and activities that are deemed not to violate the federal anti kickback statute 
however  failure to satisfy each criterion of an applicable safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement constitutes a violation of the law  rather the arrangement must be analyzed on the basis of its specific facts and circumstances 
we believe that our risk agreements satisfy the requirements of these safe harbors 
in addition  the office of the inspector general has adopted other safe harbor regulations that relate to managed care arrangements 
we believe that the incentives offered by our health plans to medicare and medicaid beneficiaries and the discounts our plans receive from contracting health care providers satisfy the requirements of these safe harbor regulations 
we believe that our arrangements do not violate the federal or similar state anti kickback laws 
cms has promulgated regulations that prohibit health plans with medicare contracts from including any direct or indirect payment to physicians or other providers as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services to a medicare beneficiary 
these regulations impose disclosure and other requirements relating to physician incentive plans such as bonuses or withholds that could result in a physician being at substantial financial risk as defined in medicare regulations 
our ability to maintain compliance with such regulations depends  in part  on our receipt of timely and accurate information from our providers 
although we believe we are in compliance with all such medicare regulations  we are subject to future audit and review 
federal employees health benefits program we contract with the office of personnel management opm to provide managed health care services under the federal employee health benefits program fehbp 
these contracts with the opm and applicable government regulations establish premium rating arrangements for this program 
the opm conducts periodic audits of its contractors to  among other things  verify that the premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with the community rating and other requirements under fehbp 
the opm may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program 
managed care legislative proposals numerous proposals have been introduced in the us congress and various state legislatures relating to managed health care reform 
the provisions of legislation that may be adopted at the state level cannot be accurately and completely predicted at this time  and we therefore cannot predict the effect of proposed legislation on our operations 
on the federal level  it is possible that some form of managed health care reform may be enacted 
at this time  it is unclear as to when any legislation might be enacted or the content of any new legislation  and we cannot predict the effect on our operations of the proposed legislation or any other legislation that may be adopted 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of on december   president george w 
bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of this act makes changes to the existing medicare law  including the creation of a new outpatient drug benefit beginning in and an immediate drug discount card for the interim period until january  the act makes managed care organizations eligible to be sponsors of both the drug card and drug benefit plan programs 
our members have access to a cms endorsed prescription drug discount card throughout and we are currently monitoring the implementation of the law to determine how it will impact our offerings in and will continue to monitor this issue as new regulations are released

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the organization of our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is as follows 

executive level overview 
critical accounting policies 
new accounting standards 
acquisitions 
membership 
results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources 
other disclosures 
risk factors executive level overview general operations we are a leading publicly traded managed health care company with approximately million members as of december  we operate a diversified portfolio of local market health plans  insurance companies and provider networks serving markets 
our operations are based in bethesda  maryland with our local markets primarily covering the mid atlantic  midwest and southeast regions of the united states 
our primary focus has been owning and operating health plans with a concentration on risk business with mid sized employer groups 
on january   we acquired first health which operates one of the largest national preferred provider organization networks 
first health is a major national provider of non risk administrative and medical management services to commercial  governmental and third party payor customers 
since the acquisition was consummated in  first health s financial position and operating results are not included in this discussion 
we believe the combination of coventry and first health creates a leading health benefits company with the size  scale and product breadth to be a market leader with significant growth opportunities 
first health s strengths and business mix are highly complementary to our existing business  enabling the following benefits  among others significantly expands our geographic presence  creating a national healthcare platform with substantial growth opportunities  diversifies our product offerings and client base and enables us to serve a full spectrum of healthcare clients nationwide  ranging from national accounts to small businesses and including corporate  federal government  state government  medicaid and medicare clients  significantly increases our fee based  non regulated cash flows  and leverages our existing operating expertise and administrative infrastructure 
highlights of performance membership increased over the prior year 
revenue increased over the prior year 
medical loss ratio of improved basis points over the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of operating revenue  a basis point improvement over the prior year 
operating margin of improved basis points over the prior year 
diluted earnings per share increased over the prior year 
cash flows from operations was million  a improvement over the prior year 
total cash and investments was billion  a increase over the prior year 

table of contents operating revenue and products we generate our operating revenues from premiums for a broad range of managed care and management service products 
premiums for our commercial risk products  for which we assume full underwriting risk  can vary 
for example  premiums for our preferred provider organization ppo and point of service pos products are typically lower than our health maintenance organization hmo premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and co payments that are typically required of the ppo and pos members 
premium rates for our government programs  medicare and state sponsored managed medicaid  are established by governmental regulatory agencies 
these government products are offered in selected markets where we believe we can achieve profitable growth based upon favorable reimbursement levels  provider costs and regulatory climates 
revenue for our management services products non risk is generally a fixed administrative fee for access to our provider networks and management services  for which we do not assume underwriting risk 
the management services we provide typically include network management  claims processing  utilization review and quality assurance 
in addition  we rent our network of providers  including claims repricing and utilization review  to other managed care plans or non risk employers and assume no underwriting risk 
during the three years ended december   we experienced substantial growth in operating revenues due in part to membership increases from acquisitions 
acquisitions must have a manageable regulatory and business climate and have the ability to add value to our company 
additionally  membership growth was achieved organically through marketing efforts  geographic expansion and increased product offerings 
our ability to introduce products quickly to each market has helped us to expand our customer base 
in particular  we have been able to add a large variety of lower cost products  which has proven especially attractive to customers 
operating expenses our medical costs include medical claims paid under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers and capitation arrangements 
medical costs also include an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
our health plans maintain provider networks that furnish health care services through contractual arrangements with physicians  hospitals and other health care providers 
prescription drug benefits are provided through a formulary comprised of an extensive list of drugs 
drug prices are negotiated through a national network of pharmacies at discounted rates 
we have capitation arrangements for certain ancillary heath care services  such as mental health care  and a small percentage of our membership is covered by global capitation arrangements 
under the typical arrangement  the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover costs of all medical care or of the specified ancillary services provided to the globally capitated members 
under some capitated arrangements  physicians may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements 
global capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs  but expose us to risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider organization 
we are ultimately responsible for the coverage of our members pursuant to the customer agreements 
to the extent that the respective provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangements  we will be required to perform such obligations 
consequently  we may have to incur costs in doing so in excess of the amounts we would otherwise have to pay under the original global or ancillary capitation arrangements 
we have established systems to monitor the availability  appropriateness and effectiveness of the patient care we provide 
we collect utilization data in each of our markets that we use to analyze over utilization or under utilization of services and assist our health plans in providing appropriate care for their members and improving patient outcomes in a cost efficient manner 
medical directors also monitor the utilization of diagnostic services and encourage the use of outpatient surgery and testing where appropriate 
each health plan collects data showing each physician s utilization profile for diagnostic tests  specialty referrals and hospitalization and presents such data to the health plan s physicians 
the medical directors monitor these results in an effort to ensure the use of cost effective  medically appropriate services 
we operate four regional service centers that perform claims processing  premium billing and collection  enrollment and customer service functions for our health plans 
our regional service centers enable us to take advantage of economies of scale  implement standardized management practices at each of our plans and capitalize on the benefits of our integrated information technology systems 
we centralize the underwriting and product pricing functions for our health plans  which allows us to utilize our underwriting expertise and a disciplined pricing strategy at each of our health plans 

table of contents cash flows we generate cash through operations 
as a profitable company in an industry that is not capital equipment intensive  we have not needed to use financing methods to fund operations 
we have a low debt to capital ratio and while we did issue senior notes in as described in 
note h to our consolidated financial statements in this form k  the entire proceeds were used to repurchase a portion of our common stock and were not used to fund operations 
our primary use of cash is to pay medical claims 
any excess cash has historically been used for acquisitions and for repurchases of our common stock 
in late january  in connection with the first health merger  we incurred approximately million of indebtedness in order to finance the acquisition of all of first health s outstanding common stock  refinance the existing indebtedness of first health and pay related transaction fees and expenses 
we do not anticipate that any of the proceeds of such indebtedness will be used to fund operations 
critical accounting policies we consider the accounting policies described below critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are ones that require difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
revenue recognition managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service 
premiums are based on both a per subscriber contract rate and the number of subscribers in our records at the time of billing 
premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage 
premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations  additions  or other changes 
due to early timing of the premium billing  we are able to identify the retroactive adjustments for two subsequent months billings 
current period revenues are adjusted to reflect these retroactive adjustments 
based on information received subsequent to generating premium billings  historical trends  bad debt write offs and the collectibility of specific accounts  we estimate  on a monthly basis  the amount of bad debt and future membership retroactivity and adjust our revenue and allowances accordingly 
as of december   we maintained allowances for retroactive billing adjustments of approximately million compared with approximately million at december  we also maintained allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the calculation for these allowances is based on a percentage of the gross accounts receivable with the allowance percentage increasing for the older receivables 
the allowances have declined as a result of an improvement in the aging of our premium receivables 
we also receive premium payments from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms on a monthly basis for our medicare membership 
membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with cms and could result in adjustments to revenue 
premiums collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenue 
we contract with the office of personnel management opm to provide managed health care services under the federal employee health benefits program fehbp 
these contracts with the opm and applicable government regulations establish premium rating arrangements for this program 
the opm conducts periodic audits of its contractors to  among other things  verify that the premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with the community rating and other requirements under fehbp 
the opm may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program 
we periodically reconcile our contracts with the opm and such reconciliations could result in adjustments to revenue 
premiums for services to federal employee groups are subject to audit and review by the opm on a periodic basis 
such audits are usually a number of years in arrears 
we record reserves  on an estimated basis annually  based on appropriate guidelines 
any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized 
we enter into performance guarantees with employer groups where we pledge that we will meet certain standards 
these standards vary widely and could involve customer service  member satisfaction  claims processing  claims accuracy  telephone on hold time  etc 
under these performance guarantees  we could be at risk and may incur penalties for not maintaining the standards established in the contracts 
the risk level varies by agreement with penalties based on a variety of calculations including per member per month  percentage of premium  or percentage of administration fees 
risk levels are evaluated at least quarterly 
we estimate our potential exposure and record appropriate reserves 
the penalties that we have incurred have been immaterial and  although  we can not predict with precision the future effect on our results of operations of these penalties  we expect them to remain immaterial 

table of contents medical claims expense and liabilities medical liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported 
medical liabilities estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider  among other things  historical claims payment patterns  provider reimbursement changes  historical utilization trends  current levels of authorized inpatient days  other medical cost inflation factors  membership levels  benefit design changes  seasonality  demographic mix change and other relevant factors 
we employ a team of actuaries that have developed  refined and used the same set of reserve models over the past several years 
these reserve models do not calculate separate amounts for reported but not paid and incurred but not reported  but rather a single estimate of medical claims liabilities 
these reserve models make use of both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities 
within these models  historical data of paid claims is formatted into claim triangles which compare claim incurred dates to the claim payment dates 
this information is analyzed to create completion factors that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred 
completion factors are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period 
actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims 
for the more recent incurred months  the percentage of claims paid to claims incurred in those months is generally low 
as a result  the completion factor methodology is less reliable for such months 
for that reason  incurred claims for recent months are not projected solely from historical completion and payment patterns 
instead  they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based upon recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels  or trend factors 
as these months mature over time  the two estimates completion factor and trend are blended with completion factors being used exclusively for older months 
within the reserve setting methodologies for inpatient and non inpatient services  we use certain assumptions 
for inpatient services  authorized days are used for utilization factors  while cost trend assumptions are incorporated into per diem amounts 
the per diem estimates reflect anticipated effects of changes in reimbursement structure and severity mix 
for non inpatient services  a composite trend assumption is applied which reflects anticipated changes in cost per service  provider contracts  utilization  and other factors 
changes in the completion factors  trend factors and utilization factors can have a significant effect on the claim liability 
the following example provides the estimated effect to our december  unpaid claims liability assuming hypothetical changes in the completion  trend  and inpatient day factors 
while we believe the selection of factors and ranges provided are reasonable  certain factors and actual results may differ 
completion factor claims trend factor inpatient day factor increase decrease in completion factor decrease increase in unpaid claims liabilities decrease increase in claims trend factor decrease increase in unpaid claims liabilities decrease increase in inpatient day factor decrease increase in unpaid claims liabilities we also establish reserves  if required  for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under the group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts 
accruals are continually monitored and reviewed  and as settlements are made or accruals adjusted  differences are reflected in current operations 
changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term 
certain situations require judgment in setting reserves  such as system conversions  processing interruptions  environmental changes or other factors 

table of contents actuarial standards of practice generally require the actuarial developed medical claims estimates to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions 
adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims 
in many situations  the claims paid amount experienced will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 
medical claims liabilities are recorded at an amount we estimate to be appropriate 
adjustments of prior years estimates may result in additional medical costs or  as we have experienced during the last several years  a reduction in medical costs in the period an adjustment was made 
our reserve models have historically developed favorably suggesting that the accrued liabilities calculated from the models were more than adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims 
we believe that this favorable development is a result of good communications between our health plans and our actuarial staff regarding medical utilization  mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trend 
the following table presents the components of the change in medical claims liabilities for the years ended december   and  respectively in thousands 
medical liabilities  beginning of period   acquisitions   reported medical costs current year    prior year    total reported medical costs    claim payments payments for current year    payments for prior year    total claim payments    medical liabilities  end of period   acquisition balances represent medical liabilities of the acquired company as of the applicable acquisition date 
subsequent changes in estimates related to the acquired balances are recorded as adjustments to the settlement account with the acquired entity s previous owner 
the negative amounts noted as prior year medical costs are favorable adjustments for claim estimates being settled for amounts less than originally anticipated 
as noted above  these favorable restatements from original estimates occur due to changes in medical utilization  mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trends 
medical claim liabilities are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider 
accordingly  the prior year medical costs relate almost entirely to claims incurred in calendar year we believe that the amount of medical liabilities is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of december   however  actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates 

table of contents investments we account for investments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all of our investments as available for sale 
investments are evaluated at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary 
in making that determination  we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security 
this evidence includes  but is not limited to  the following adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer  segment  industry  region or other variables  the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value  elimination or reduction in dividend payments  or scheduled interest and principal  rating agency downgrade of a debt security  and expected cash flows of a debt security 
temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity 
a decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be other than temporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings 
realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis 
the following table shows our investments gross unrealized losses and fair value  at december   aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position in thousands 
less than months months or more total description of securities fair value unrealized loss fair value unrealized loss fair value unrealized loss state and municipal bonds   us treasury agency securities   mortgage backed securities    asset backed securities    corporate debt and other securities    the securities presented in this table do not meet the criteria for an other than temporarily impaired investment 
these securities have an investment grade credit rating 
the current unrealized loss is the result of interest rate increases and not unfavorable changes in the credit ratings associated with these securities 
these investments are not in high risk industries or sectors and we intend to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in market value 
investments with original maturities in excess of three months and less than one year are classified as short term investments and generally consist of corporate bonds  us treasury notes and commercial paper 
long term investments have original maturities in excess of one year and primarily consist of fixed income securities 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives are subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we use three approaches to identifying the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets a market approach  a market capitalization approach and an income approach 
the market approach estimates a business s fair value by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies 
the market capitalization approach is based on the market value of our total shares outstanding 
the income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
all three approaches are reviewed together for consistency and commonality 
any impairment charges that may result will be recorded in the period in which the impairment took place as recalculated on october  our annual impairment test date 
we have not incurred an impairment charge related to goodwill or indefinite intangibles

new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no

accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r on july  using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  have recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have an effect on our results of operations  although it will have no material effect on our overall financial position 
the effect of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods using the black scholes method of valuation  the effect of that standard would have approximated the effect of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in 
note a to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future as it is dependent upon  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows that would have been recognized under sfas no 
in  and for such excess tax benefits were million  million  and million  respectively 
acquisitions during the three years ended december   we completed several business combinations and membership purchases 
these business combinations are all accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the operating results of each acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their effective date of acquisition 
the purchase price for each business combination was allocated to the assets  including the identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities based on estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill 
the purchase price of our membership purchases is allocated to identifiable intangible assets and is being amortized over a useful life of ten to twenty years 

table of contents the following table summarizes all business combinations and membership purchases for the three years ended december  the purchase price of each business combination includes the payment for net worth and estimated transition costs 
the estimated transition costs may be adjusted as actual expenses are incurred  thereby affecting the final purchase price of the acquisition 
in addition  most of our acquisition agreements contain a provision for a final retroactive balance sheet settlement which may result in adjustments to the purchase price 
the purchase price shown for recent acquisitions  in thousands  is inclusive of all retroactive balance sheet settlements to date and transaction cost adjustments

december  percent change risk membership commercial   medicare medicaid total risk membership   non risk membership total membership   medicaid membership increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of omnicare in the fourth quarter of the increase in non risk membership was influenced by three large groups changing from a risk product to a non risk product effective january   as well as from additional organic membership obtained in the missouri market 
in january  we lost a large commercial insured account to an administrative services only aso bid and a large existing aso account to another third party administrator 
because of the loss of this membership  organic growth was negative in january but currently is expected to be one to three percent for all of

commercial yields premium per member per month increased as a result of rate increases on renewals that occurred throughout all markets 
medicare yields increased as a result of the rate increases from the annual adjusted community rating filings and from the medicare modernization act 
the rate increases from the medicare modernization act were required to be used for enhanced member benefits and or network access and thus did not affect profitability 
the acquisition of altius effective september  and omnicare effective october  accounted for million of the increase in managed care premium revenue over the prior year 
management services revenue increased due to the increase in non risk membership discussed earlier 
medical costs have increased due to medical trend  acquisitions and organic growth 
however  total medical expense as a percentage of managed care premium revenue has improved to over the prior year 
this favorable change was attributable mostly to our commercial business and is a result of the commercial premium rate increases mentioned above outpacing commercial medical trend 
reported commercial medical trend  net of benefit buy downs  was 
our medicare business medical loss ratio improved compared to the prior year as a result of the increase in premium yields discussed above 
our overall medicaid medical loss ratio was essentially flat compared to prior year 
excluding omnicare  the medicaid medical loss ratio would have improved to 
the same store improvement is as a result of rate increases across our markets and as a result of much improved performance in our medicaid virginia market 
the virginia market benefited from lower utilization  lower drug costs and favorable provider contract renegotiations 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense increased primarily due to normal operating costs of recent acquisitions  an increase in broker commissions and an increase in salary expenses 
broker commissions  excluding acquisitions  have increased due to the growth in both organic membership and in premium rates 
salary expenses  excluding acquisitions  have increased due to annual compensation increases  additional amortization expense related to restricted shares of common stock granted in and  and incremental compensation expense related to our organic membership growth 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue have improved as a result of continuing revenue growth and success in controlling customer service costs 
other income increased due to an increase in interest income as a result of higher interest rates and as a result of a larger investment portfolio in additionally  other income included a gain from sale of our single derivative investment which partially offsets the current year increase 
our provision for income taxes increased due to an increase in earnings before taxes

excluding the altius acquisition  the commercial yield increased 
medicare yields increased as a result of changes being made to rate structures  as well as changes in demographics 
the acquisitions of mid america  personalcare  and altius resulted in an increase in managed care premium revenue of approximately million

management services revenue increased due to the increase in non risk membership discussed earlier 
medical costs have increased due to acquisitions  organic growth and medical trend 
our total medical costs as a percentage of managed care premiums for all products improved 
this favorable change was attributable mostly to our commercial business and is a result of the commercial premium rate increases mentioned above outpacing commercial medical trend 
reported commercial medical trends  net of benefit buy downs  have been below for each of the last two years 
our medicare business medical loss ratio improved as a result of an increase in premium yields discussed above and exiting three counties in the kansas city market on january  our medicaid medical loss ratio increased as a result of changes in the geographical markets in which we operate  and an increase in membership in a capitated service 
we exited the delaware medicaid market on july  within our pennsylvania market  membership in our capitated medicaid behavioral health program has increased significantly during and this program has a high medical loss ratio  but is lower in risk to our company 
our days in total medical claims liabilities have decreased days from prior year due to faster claim receipts and processing cycle times as well as efforts to reduce claim inventories

as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense decreased by 
senior notes interest and amortization expense has increased in due to the issuance of the notes on february   the prior year period represented eleven months of interest compared to twelve months in also contributing to the increase is a million loss on the repurchase of a portion of our senior notes at a premium in the third quarter of other income increased due to a larger investment portfolio in offset by a decrease in interest income as a result of lower interest rates 
additionally  the current year included a gain from our single derivative investment compared to a loss in the prior year 
this derivative investment was sold during the second quarter of our provision for income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in earnings before taxes 
the effective tax rate increased to in from in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity the nature of our operations is such that cash receipts from premium revenues are typically received up to two months prior to the expected cash payment for related medical costs 
premium revenues are typically received at the beginning of the month in which they are earned  and the corresponding incurred medical expenses are paid in a future time period  typically to days after the date such medical services are rendered 
the lag between premium receipts and claims payments creates positive cash flow and overall cash growth 
as a result  we typically hold approximately two months of float 
in addition  accumulated earnings provide further positive cash flow 
in addition to ample current liquidity  our long term investment portfolio is available for further liquidity needs 
our investment guidelines emphasize investment grade fixed income instruments in order to provide liquidity to meet future payment obligations and minimize the risk to the principal 
the fixed income portfolio includes government and corporate securities with an average quality rating of aa and an average contractual duration of years  as of december  typically  the amount and duration of our short term assets are more than sufficient to pay for our short term liabilities  and we do not anticipate that sales of our long term investment portfolio will be necessary to fund our claims liabilities 
our total cash and investments  consisting of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments  but excluding deposits of million restricted under state regulations  increased million to billion at december  from billion at december we will continue to fund our working capital requirements from our cash flow from operations 
we believe that because our long term investments are available for sale  the amount of such investments should be considered when assessing our liquidity 
on such basis  current assets plus long term investments available for sale less current liabilities increased to billion at december  from million at december  the demand for our products and services are subject to many economic fluctuations  risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the way we do business 
please refer to the section entitled risk factors in this form k for more information 
management believes that the combination of our ability to generate cash flows from operations  cash and investments on hand and the excess funds held in certain of our regulated subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund continuing operations  capital expenditures  debt interest costs and any other reasonably likely future cash requirements 
cash flows net cash from operating activities is primarily driven by net earnings 
for the year ended december   operating cash flow was positively affected by an increase in medical claims liabilities and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities 
medical liabilities were unusually low at december  due to an effort to pay down medical claims inventory at year end 
the medical liabilities increased in as claim inventory levels returned to more normal levels and due to medical liabilities recorded for the new members brought on with the omnicare membership purchase in october of accounts payable and other liabilities increased as a result of an increase in taxes payable and an increase in the deferred compensation liability 
offsetting these operating cash inflows was a decrease in deferred revenue 
as a result of the timing of cms payments for medicare beneficiaries  we only received eleven monthly cms payments in versus twelve monthly cms payments in partially offsetting the one less cms payment was an increase in commercial deferred revenue collections 
cash flow from operating activities has improved over the prior year as a result of higher earnings  an increase in unpaid medical liabilities and a larger increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
offsetting these improvements was a change in deferred revenue  the reasons for which are noted above 
prior year operating cash flows included a decrease in other receivables due to accelerated collections of our pharmacy rebate receivable as a result of improved procedures implemented in the pharmacy rebate receivable remained consistent at december  compared to december  and thus did not change operating cash flow year over year 
financing and investing activities our board of directors has approved a program to repurchase up to of our outstanding common stock 
stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices on the open market  by block purchase or in private transactions 
as a part of this program  we purchased million shares of our common stock in at an aggregate cost of million  no shares in and million shares during the first quarter of at an aggregate cost of million 
as of december   the total remaining common shares we are authorized to repurchase under the program is approximately million 
excluded from these amounts are shares purchased in exchange for employee payroll taxes on vesting of restricted stock awards as these purchases are not part of the program 

table of contents on february  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the proceeds from the sale were used to purchase  from principal health care  inc  million shares of our common stock and a warrant exercisable  at that time  for million shares of our common stock 
the aggregate purchase price for the shares of common stock and warrant was million 
interest on our senior notes is payable on february and august each year 
the notes mature on february  in august  we repurchased a portion of our senior notes with a face value of million and a weighted average premium of 
we recorded a loss on the repurchase in accordance with sfas no 
which requires gains and loses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations 
the loss of million was included as additional interest expense 
the carrying value of our senior notes is equal to the face value and the fair value is based on the quoted market prices 
as of december   the carrying value was million and the fair value was million 
our senior notes contain certain covenants and restrictions regarding incurring additional debt  limiting dividends or other restricted payments  and restricting transactions with affiliates  sales of assets and consolidations or mergers 
we have complied with all covenants under the senior notes 
during january  we incurred approximately million of additional indebtedness related to the acquisition of first health 
the additional indebtedness includes new senior  unsecured credit facilities consisting of a million five year term loan  all of which was drawn at closing  and a million five year revolving credit facility  of which million was drawn at closing 
loans under the new senior credit facilities bear interest at a margin or spread in excess of either the one  two  three or six month rate for the eurodollar deposits the eurodollar rate or the greater of the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate of the administrative agent abr  as selected by us 
the margin or spread depends on the debt ratings assigned to the new credit facilities and our consolidated leverage ratio and varies from to for eurodollar rate loans and from to for abr loans 
commitment fees will accrue and be payable quarterly in arrears at an initial rate of per annum  and subsequently at a rate ranging from to depending on the debt ratings assigned to the new credit facilities and our consolidated leverage ratio  multiplied by the daily average undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility 
the term loan has a maturity of five years and will amortize in consecutive quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to of the original principal amount of the term loan during the first two years thereof  of the original principal amount of the term loan during the next two years  with the balance payable in four equal installments in year five 
unless terminated earlier  the revolving credit facility terminates five years after closing and is payable in full upon its maturity on the termination date 
the credit agreement contains covenants  including  among other things  covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  incur guarantee obligations  create or permit liens on assets  engage in mergers or consolidations  dispose of assets  pay dividends or other distributions  purchase or redeem our equity securities or those of our subsidiaries and make other restricted payments  make loans  advances or other investments including acquisitions  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  agree with others to limit their ability to grant liens on assets  agree with others to limit the ability of the our subsidiaries to pay dividends or other restricted payments or to make loans or transfer assets to us or another of our subsidiaries 
the new senior credit facilities also require compliance with specified financial ratios and tests  including a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum net worth requirement 
the additional indebtedness also includes the private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due these senior notes have since been registered with the securities and exchange commission 
the senior notes are general unsecured obligations of ours and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt  including our existing senior notes due and our new credit facilities 
the indentures under which the new notes have been issued  among other things  restrict our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to make investments  incur or guarantee additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock  create liens  incur dividend or other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries  and merge or consolidate with other entities 
from and after the date on which the notes receive investment grade ratings from two designated rating agencies  certain covenants related to the notes will terminate 
we used the proceeds from the new credit facilities and senior notes  together with approximately million of cash on hand  to fund the first health acquisition  including the repayment of first health s outstanding bank debt and related transaction expenses 
projected cash payments for the final payment for the omnicare purchase are million in the first quarter of projected capital payments in of approximately million to million consist primarily of computer hardware  software and related equipment costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational and communication systems 

table of contents health plans our regulated hmo and insurance company subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances  thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from our regulated entities 
during  we received million in dividends and million for note repayments from our regulated subsidiaries 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has proposed that states adopt risk based capital rbc standards that  if adopted  would generally require higher minimum capitalization requirements for hmos and other risk bearing health care entities 
rbc is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile 
the managed care organization s rbc is calculated by applying factors to various assets  premiums and reserve items 
the factor is higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items 
the adequacy of a managed care organization s actual capital can then be measured by a comparison to its rbc as determined by the formula 
our health plans are required to submit an rbc report to the naic and their domiciled state s department of insurance with their annual filing 
regulators will use the rbc results to determine if any regulatory actions are required 
regulatory actions that could take place  if any  range from filing a financial action plan explaining how the plan will increase its statutory net worth to the approved levels  to the health plan being placed under regulatory control 
the majority of states in which we operate health plans have adopted a risk based capital rbc policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the company action level which is currently equal to of their rbc 
we have adopted an internal policy to maintain all of our regulated subsidiaries statutory capital and surplus at or above of their rbc and a level of in aggregate referred to below as of rbc 
some states in which our regulated subsidiaries operate require deposits to be maintained with the respective states departments of insurance 
the table below summarizes our statutory reserve information  as of december  and in millions  except percentage data 
statutory information in millions  except percentage data regulated capital and surplus a of rbc a excess capital and surplus above of rbc a capital and surplus as percentage of rbc a statutory deposits a unaudited the increase in capital and surplus for our regulated subsidiaries is a result of income from offset by dividends paid to the parent company 
we believe that all subsidiaries which incur medical claims maintain more than adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet these short term obligations as a matter of both company policy and multiple department of insurance regulations 
excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation  we had cash and investments of approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in non regulated cash and investments is primarily a result of dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries  as mentioned above  and ordinary operating activities offset by stock repurchases made and payments for acquisitions 
during the year ended december   we made capital contributions of approximately million to our hmo subsidiaries 
of this total  million was made to our newly formed michigan subsidiary to meet statutory capital requirements 

table of contents other the united states department of health and human services has issued rules  as mandated by the health insurance portability and accountability act of  which  among other things  impose security and privacy requirements with respect to individually identifiable patient data  including a member s transactions with health care providers and payors  as well as requirements for the standardization of certain electronic transaction code sets and provider identifiers 
we have spent approximately million  million and million on compliance matters for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we do not anticipate future spending related to these rules to be material 
as of december   we were contractually obligated to make the following payments within the next five years and thereafter in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years senior notes  interest payable on senior notes      operating leases      total contractual obligations      less sublease income      net contractual obligations     refer to

we have typically paid to of medical claims within months of the date incurred and approximately of medical claims within months of the date incurred 
accordingly  we believe medical claims liabilities are short term in nature and therefore do not meet the listed criteria for classification as contractual obligations and have been excluded from the table above 
after giving effect to the new senior notes and new credit facilities in january  we will be contractually obligated to make the following payments  in addition to the payments shown in the table above  within the next five years and thereafter in thousands payments due by period new debt obligations total less than year years years more than years new senior notes  interest payable on new senior notes     new credit facilities     interest payable on new credit facilities a    total additional contractual obligations   a subject to changes in the variable interest rates as discussed earlier 

table of contents other disclosure legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims denied by the company  medical malpractice actions  employment related claims and other various claims seeking monetary damages 
the claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
incidents occurring through december  may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we maintain general liability  professional liability and employment practices liability insurances in amounts that we believe are appropriate  with varying deductibles for which we maintain reserves 
the professional liability and employment practices liability insurances are carried through our captive subsidiary 
we are a defendant in the provider track in the managed care litigation filed in the united states district court for the southern district of florida  miami division  multi district litigation mdl  styled in re managed care litigation  mdl no 
this lawsuit was filed by a group of physicians as a class action against coventry and twelve other companies in the managed care industry 
the plaintiffs have alleged violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico  conspiracy to violate rico and aiding and abetting a scheme to violate rico 
in addition to these federal law claims  the complaint includes state law claims for breach of contract  violations of various state prompt payment laws and equitable claims for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit 
the trial court has dismissed several of the state law claims and ordered that all physicians who have an arbitration provision in their provider contracts must submit their direct rico claims and all of their remaining state law claims to arbitration 
as a consequence of this ruling  all the plaintiffs who have arbitration provisions voluntarily dismissed all of their claims that are subject to arbitration 
the trial court however has ordered that the plaintiffs claims of conspiracy  conspiracy to violate rico and aiding and abetting violations of rico are not subject to arbitration 
the defendants appeal to the th circuit challenging the trial court s arbitration decision was denied 
the trial court has certified various subclasses of physicians  however  we are not subject to the class certification order because the motion to certify was filed before we were joined as a defendant 
the plaintiffs have now filed a motion to certify various subclasses as to coventry 
we have filed our opposition to that motion which remains pending before the trial court 
the defendants who were subject to the class certification order filed an appeal to the th circuit court of appeals 
the court of appeals has overturned the class certification order as to the plaintiffs state law claims but affirmed the certification with respect to the plaintiffs federal law claims 
the us supreme court has denied the defendants petition to review the th circuit s class certification decision 
two defendants have entered into settlement agreements with the plaintiffs 
both settlement agreements have been filed with the court and have received final approval 
this mdl lawsuit has triggered the filing of copycat class action complaints by other health care providers such as chiropractors  podiatrists  acupuncturists and other licensed health care professionals 
each of these actions has been transferred to the mdl and has been designated as tag along actions 
the court has entered an order which stays all proceedings in the tag along actions until all pre trial proceedings in the mdl action have been concluded 
although we can not predict the outcome  management believes that the mdl lawsuit and tag along actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or its results of operations 
management also believes that the claims asserted in these lawsuits are without merit  and we intend to defend our position 
several companies in the insurance industry have received subpoenas for information from the new york attorney general and the connecticut attorney general with respect to an industrywide investigation into certain insurance brokerage practices  including broker compensation arrangements  bid quoting practices and potential antitrust violations 
as of the filing of this annual report on form k  coventry has not been served with any such subpoenas 
as a consequence of the attorney general investigations in new york and connecticut  coventry  like most other companies in the insurance industry  has received letters of inquiry from the departments of insurance in several states in which it does business 
these letters  which are very similar  if not identical  seek information regarding broker compensation arrangements  bid quoting practices and conduct which may potentially constitute antitrust violations 
coventry has provided the information requested by these letters and currently does not anticipate any additional follow up or requests for additional information 
legislation and regulation as a managed health care company  we are subject to extensive government regulation of our products and services 
the laws and regulations affecting our industry generally give state and federal regulatory authorities broad discretion in their exercise of supervisory  regulatory and administrative powers 
these laws and regulations are intended primarily for the benefit of the members of the health plans 
managed care laws and regulations vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and changes are frequently considered and implemented 
likewise  interpretations of these laws and regulations are also subject to change 
although the provisions of any legislation adopted at the state or federal level can not be accurately predicted at this time  management believes that the ultimate outcome of currently proposed legislation should not have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations in the short term 
nevertheless  it is possible that future legislation or regulation could have a significant effect on our operations 

table of contents inflation in recent years  health care cost inflation has exceeded the general inflation rate 
to reduce the effect of health care cost inflation on our business operations we have  where possible  increased premium rates and implemented cost control measures in our patient care management and provider contracting 
we can not be certain that we will be able to increase future premium rates at a rate that equals or exceeds the health care cost inflation rate or that our other cost control measures will be effective 
outlook our health plans operate in highly competitive markets  but we believe that the pricing environment is rational in our existing markets  thus creating the opportunity for reasonable price increases 
we will continue to obtain adequate premium increases and expect premium rates to continue to rise at a rate equal to or greater than medical trend in management believes that existing markets have potential for premium growth for our commercial and governmental products 
in  we have received medicare premium rate increases of seven to ten percent 
additionally  we have received a medicaid rate increase of effective january  in missouri  our largest medicaid market 
the acquisition of first health will provide significant growth opportunities 
for  we will pursue achievement of synergies  the alignment business operations  accountabilities  and people toward future success  and the establishment of a foundation for future growth in each of the businesses 
risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
further  the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to accurately estimate and control future health care costs 
most of the premium revenue we receive is based upon rates set months before we deliver services 
as a result  our results of operations largely depend on our ability to accurately estimate and control future health care costs 
we base the premiums we charge  at least in part  on our estimate of expected health care costs over the applicable premium period 
factors that may cause health care costs to exceed our estimates include an increase in the cost of health care services and supplies  including pharmaceuticals  higher than expected utilization of health care services  periodic renegotiations of hospital  physician and other provider contracts  the occurrence of epidemics and catastrophic events  changes in the demographics of our members and medical trends affecting them  general inflation or economic downturns  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes that increase our costs  and other unforeseen occurrences 
in addition  medical liabilities in our financial statements include our estimated reserves for incurred but not reported and reported but not paid claims 
the estimates for medical liabilities are made on an accrual basis 
we believe that our reserves for medical liabilities are adequate  but we can not assure you of this 
any adjustments to our medical liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations 
our results of operations will be adversely affected if we are unable to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs 
our results of operations depend on our ability to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs 
although we attempt to base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs  we may not be able to control the premiums we charge as a result of competition  government regulations and other factors 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to set premium rates at appropriate levels or adjust premium rates in the event our health care costs increase 

table of contents a reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations 
a reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations 
factors that could contribute to the loss of membership include competition in premium or plan benefits from other health care benefit companies  reductions in the number of employers offering health care coverage  reductions in work force by existing customers  our increases in premiums or benefit changes  our exit from a market or the termination of a health plan  and negative publicity and news coverage relating to our company or the managed health care industry generally 
we do not currently anticipate additional growth through acquisitions in part of our growth strategy historically has been to grow through the acquisition of additional health plans 
during the last several years  we have significantly increased our membership through a number of acquisitions 
because of the size of the first health acquisition  we anticipate that our management will focus on the integration of first health and we do not currently intend to acquire additional health plans in competition in our industry may limit our ability to attract new members or to increase or maintain our premium rates  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment that may affect our ability to attract new members and increase premium rates 
we compete with other health plans for members 
we believe the principal factors influencing the choice among health care options are price of benefits offered and cost and risk of alternatives such as self insurance  location and choice of health care providers  quality of customer service  comprehensiveness of coverage offered  reputation for quality care  financial stability of the plan  and diversity of product offerings 
we face competition from other managed care companies that may have broader geographical coverage  more established reputations in our markets  greater market share  larger contracting scale  lower costs and or greater financial and other resources 
we also may face increased rate competition from certain blue cross plan competitors that might be required by state regulation to reduce capital surpluses that may be deemed excessive 
competition in the federal employees benefit plan and recent plan design changes in the mail handlers benefit plan may reduce membership and revenues 
the mail handlers benefit plan  which is administered by first health  competes against a number of national carriers and local health plans for federal employee membership 
first health has sought through plan design changes  including premium increases  changes in employee cost sharing and benefit changes  to create a more attractive and competitive mail handlers product offering to attract new members as well as retain existing members 
as these new products are introduced for  it is expected that there will be some loss of existing membership as the new benefit plans may be more attractive to potential members than existing members 
in addition  the new plan design changes for the benefit plan year may result in a greater than expected loss of membership if these products are not as attractive or competitive as we anticipate 
competition in the multi site  national account business may limit our ability to grow revenues which could adversely affect our results of operations 
first health competes in a highly competitive environment against other major national managed care companies in its corporate line of business to provide administrative  network access  and medical management services to large  multi site  self insured employers 
among these competitors are aetna  united healthcare and blue card a joint venture of major blue cross plans  all of which have greater resources  brand identity and contracting scale compared to first health or coventry 

table of contents we depend on the services of non exclusive independent agents and brokers to market our products to employers  and we can not assure you that they will continue to market our products in the future 
we depend on the services of independent agents and brokers to market our managed care products and services  particularly to small employer group members 
we do not have long term contracts with independent agents and brokers  who typically are not dedicated exclusively to us and frequently market the health care products of our competitors 
we face intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent agents and brokers  and we can not assure you that agents and brokers will continue to market our products in a fair and consistent manner 
our failure to obtain cost effective agreements with a sufficient number of providers may result in higher medical costs and a decrease in our membership 
our future results largely depend on our ability to enter into cost effective agreements with hospitals  physicians and other health care providers 
the terms of those provider contracts will have a material effect on our medical costs and our ability to control these costs 
in addition  our ability to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a particular geographic market will impact the relative attractiveness of our managed care products in those markets 
in some of our markets  there are large provider systems that have a major presence 
some of these large provider systems have operated their own health plans in the past or may choose to do so in the future 
these provider systems could adversely affect our product offerings and results of operations if they refuse to contract with us  place us at a competitive disadvantage or use their market position to negotiate contracts that are less favorable to us 
provider agreements are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiations 
we can not assure you that these large provider systems will continue to contract with us or that they will contract with us on terms that are favorable to us 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally or our company in particular could adversely affect our results of operations or business 
over the last several years  the managed health care industry has been subject to negative publicity 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally or our company in particular may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations by requiring us to change our products and services  increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate  or adversely affecting our ability to market our products or services 
negative publicity relating to our company or the managed care industry generally also may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain members 
a failure of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 
we depend on our information technology systems for timely and accurate information 
failure to maintain effective and efficient information technology systems or disruptions in our information technology systems could cause disruptions in our business operations  loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  disputes with customers and providers  regulatory problems  increases in administrative expenses and other adverse consequences 
the anticipated benefits of acquiring first health may not be realized 
we anticipate our acquisition of first health will result in various benefits including  among other things  benefits relating to enhanced revenues  a strengthened market position  cross selling opportunities  technology  cost savings and operating efficiencies 
achieving the anticipated benefits of the first health acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties  including whether we integrate first health in an efficient and effective manner  and general competitive factors in the marketplace 
failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs  decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management s time and energy and could materially impact our business  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents we may face substantial difficulties  costs and delays in integrating first health 
these factors may include potential difficulty in leveraging the value of the separate technologies of the combined company  perceived adverse changes in product offerings available to customers and customer services standards  whether or not these changes do  in fact  occur  managing customer and provider overlap and potential pricing conflicts  costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures  potential charges to earnings resulting from the application of purchase accounting to the transaction  difficulty comparing financial reports due to differing management systems  diversion of management resources from the business of the combined company  the retention of existing customers of each company  including  with respect to first health  the mail handlers benefit plan a nationally offered health plan for federal employees  reduction or loss of customer orders due to the potential for market confusion  hesitation and delay  retaining and integrating management and other key employees of the combined company  and coordinating infrastructure operations in an effective and efficient manner 
after the first health acquisition  we may seek to combine certain operations and functions using common information and communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resource practices  including training  professional development and benefit programs 
we may be unsuccessful in implementing the integration of these systems and processes 
for its fiscal year  first health s revenues were approximately million 
while we believe that the companies share certain similar cultural characteristics and philosophies  the differences in size and scope of operations may affect our management processes 
any one or all of these factors  many of which are outside of our control  may cause increased operating costs  worse than anticipated financial performance or the loss of customers and employees 
many of these factors are also outside the control of either company 
we conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and changes in laws or regulations or violations of regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our business is heavily regulated by federal  state and local authorities 
legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we currently do business may in the future adversely affect our business and results of operations 
legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm us and our subsidiaries include changes that impose increased liability for adverse consequences of medical decisions  limit premium levels  increase minimum capital  reserves and other financial viability requirements  impose fines or other penalties for the failure to pay claims promptly  impose fines or other penalties as a result of market conduct reviews  prohibit or limit rental access to health care provider networks  prohibit or limit provider financial incentives and provider risk sharing arrangements  require health plans to offer expanded or new benefits  limit the ability of health plans to manage care and utilization due to any willing provider and direct access laws that restrict or prohibit product features that encourage members to seek services from contracted providers or through referral by a primary care provider  limit contractual terms with providers  including audit  payment and termination provisions  implement mandatory third party review processes for coverage denials  and impose additional health care information privacy or security requirements 
we also may be subject to governmental investigations or inquiries from time to time 
for example  several companies in the insurance industry have received subpoenas for information from the new york attorney general and the connecticut attorney general with respect to an industry wide investigation into certain insurance brokerage practices  including broker compensation arrangements  bid quoting practices and potential antitrust violations 
insurance regulators in several states  including states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled  have sent letters of inquiry concerning similar matters to the companies subject to this jurisdiction  including our subsidiaries 
we have furnished the information requested and have cooperated with the insurance regulatory authorities 
the existence of such investigations in our industry could negatively impact the market value of all companies in our industry including our stock price 
any similar governmental investigations of coventry could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or business or result in significant liabilities to the company  as well as adverse publicity 

table of contents in addition  we are required to obtain and maintain various regulatory approvals to market many of our products 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could adversely impact our results of operations 
federal  state and local authorities frequently consider changes to laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business 
we can not predict the changes that government authorities will approve in the future or assure you that those changes will not have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we face periodic reviews  audits and investigations under our contracts with federal and state government agencies  and these audits could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business 
we contract with various federal and state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services 
pursuant to these contracts  we are subject to various governmental reviews  audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations 
any adverse review  audit or investigation could result in refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts  imposition of fines  penalties and other sanctions on us  loss of our right to participate in various federal programs  damage to our reputation in various markets  increased difficulty in selling our products and services  and loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurer or hmo or to otherwise provide a service 
we are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our business  including litigation based on new or evolving legal theories  that could adversely affect our results of operations 
due to the nature of our business  we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including claims relating to our denial of non covered benefits  vicarious liability for our actions or medical malpractice claims  disputes with our providers over alleged violations of rico  disputes with our providers over compensation and termination of provider contracts  disputes related to our non risk business  including actions alleging breach of fiduciary duties  claim administration errors and failure to disclose network rate discounts and other fee and rebate arrangements  disputes over our co payment calculations  customer audits of our compliance with our plan obligations  and disputes over payments for out of network benefits 
in addition  plaintiffs continue to bring new types of legal claims against managed care companies 
recent court decisions and legislative activity increase our exposure to these types of claims 
in some cases  plaintiffs may seek class action status and substantial economic  non economic or punitive damages 
the loss of even one of these claims  if it resulted in a significant damage award  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in the event a plaintiff were to obtain a significant damage award it may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain 
we can not determine with any certainty what new theories of recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on the managed care industry in general or on us in particular 
we have  and expect to maintain  liability insurance coverage for some of the potential legal liabilities we may incur 
currently  professional liability and employment practices liability insurance is covered through our captive subsidiary 
potential liabilities that we incur may not  however  be covered by insurance  our insurers may dispute coverage or may be unable to meet their obligations or the amount of our insurance coverage may be inadequate 
we can not assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future  or that insurance will continue to be available on a cost effective basis  if at all 
our stock price and trading volume may be volatile 

table of contents from time to time  the price and trading volume of our common stock  as well as the stock of other companies in the health care industry may experience periods of significant volatility 
company specific issues and developments generally in the health care industry including the regulatory environment and the capital markets may cause this volatility 
our stock price and trading volume may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  including variations in our operating results  changes in the market s expectations about our future operating results  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our company or the health care industry generally  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  news reports relating to trends in our markets  changes in the laws and regulations affecting our business  acquisitions and financings by us or others in our industry  and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our directors and executive officers or principal stockholders  or the perception that such sales could occur 
our indebtedness imposes restrictions on our business and operations 
the indentures for our senior notes and bank credit agreement impose restrictions on our business and operations 
these restrictions limit our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  create or permit certain liens on our assets  sell assets  create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and consolidate or merge with or into other companies or sell all or substantially all of our assets 
our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness will depend on numerous factors beyond our control 
our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
our ability to generate the cash necessary to service our indebtedness is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
in addition  we will be more vulnerable to economic downturns  adverse industry conditions and competitive pressures as a result of our significant indebtedness 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms 
our stockholder rights plan  certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could delay  discourage or prevent a change in control of our company that our stockholders consider favorable 

table of contents we have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals 
the rights issued under the stockholder rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors 
in addition  provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may delay  discourage or prevent a merger  acquisition or change in control involving our company that our stockholders may consider favorable 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
among other things  these provisions authorize us to issue preferred stock  the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors and may adversely affect the voting or economic rights of our common stockholders  provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms so that no more than one third of our directors can be replaced at any annual meeting  provide that directors may be removed without cause only by the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding shares  provide that any amendment or repeal of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation establishing our classified board of directors must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of three fourths of our outstanding shares  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at a meeting 
these provisions of our stockholder rights plan  certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
general economic conditions changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the state of the economy could adversely affect our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to collect or increase premiums 
the state of the economy could also adversely affect the states budgets  which could result in the states attempting to reduce payments to medicaid plans in those states in which we offer medicaid plans  and increase taxes and assessments on our activities 
although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through  among other things  increases in premiums  there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs resulting from any budget cuts in states in which we operate 
although we have attempted to diversify our product offerings to address the changing needs of our membership  the effects of economic conditions could cause our existing membership to seek health coverage alternatives that we do not offer or could result in significant membership loss  lower average premium yields or decreased margins on continuing membership

we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments 
our policies include an emphasis on credit quality and the management of our portfolio s duration and mix of securities 
we believe our investment portfolio is diversified and currently expect no material loss to result from the failure to perform by the issuers of the debt securities we hold 
the mortgage backed securities are insured by several associations  including government national mortgage administration  federal national mortgage administration and the federal home loan mortgage corporation 
we invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all our investments as available for sale 
investments are evaluated at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary 
in making that determination  we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security 
this evidence includes  but is not limited to  the following adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer  segment  industry  region or other variables  the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value  elimination or reduction in dividend payments  or scheduled interest and principal  rating agency downgrade of a debt security  and expected cash flows of a debt security 

table of contents temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity 
a decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be other than temporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings
