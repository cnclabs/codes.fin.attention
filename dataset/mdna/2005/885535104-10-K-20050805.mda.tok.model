accordingly  the consolidated financial statements reflect the commworks division as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to our continuing operations 
business overview we provide secure  converged networking solutions on a global scale to businesses of all sizes 
our products and solutions enable customers to manage business critical voice and data in a secure and efficient network environment 
we deliver networking products and services for enterprises that view their networks as mission critical and value superior performance 
our products form integrated solutions and function in multi vendor environments 
our products are sold on a worldwide basis through a combination of value added partners and direct sales representatives 
our long term technology based strategy centers on enterprises and public sector organizations migrating to secure internet protocol ip based infrastructures that deliver converged voice and data applications 
our products and services can generally be classified in the following categories networking infrastructure  voice over ip voip telephony  security  network and security management  and global services we have undergone significant changes in recent years  including significant headcount reductions  restructuring activities which included outsourcing of information technology  all manufacturing activity  and other functions  and selling excess facilities  significant changes to our executive leadership  forming the huawei com joint venture h c  acquiring tippingpoint technologies  inc  and realigning our sales and marketing channels and expenditures 
we believe an overview of these significant recent events is helpful to an understanding of our operating results 
significant events in fiscal  as our sales and overall financial performance declined  we undertook several broad initiatives to achieve cost savings 
the first of these actions included the integration of certain central functions of our business units in order to achieve cost savings 
this integration did not substantially change our management and operating structure 
other actions pursued in fiscal were headcount reductions  outsourcing of certain it functions  and efforts to consolidate and sell excess facilities 
all of these actions generated restructuring charges  but also resulted in reductions of research and development and general and administrative expenses 
during fiscal  we undertook a number of actions  affecting both sales and expenses 
we expanded our product portfolio to include more layer plus and higher end products  additional modular switches and routers  and a higher end voip offering 
we consolidated our company s operations into a single integrated business organized along functional lines  and we relocated headquarters and key management positions and functions from our santa clara  california location to our marlborough  massachusetts location as a more effective way to run this simplified business 
also  we consolidated our operations into fewer facilities  disposed of excess real estate  relocated transaction processing activities to lower cost locations  outsourced our dublin  ireland manufacturing operations to our contract manufacturers  and upgraded and modified our it infrastructure and systems to more cost effective alternatives 
in addition  during fiscal  we reduced our overall workforce by approximately forty percent 
on november   we formed our joint venture  huawei com h c  which is domiciled in hong kong and has its principal operating center in hangzhou  china 
we contributed million in cash  assets related to our operations in china and japan  and licenses to intellectual property related to those operations in exchange for a percent ownership interest of the joint venture 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we expanded the joint venture s market to include hong kong in addition to china and japan 
we expect this venture to provide three key benefits to us an expanded product line  access to low cost and highly effective engineering talent  and a significant presence in the china  japan  and hong kong markets 
two years after formation of h c  we have the one time option to purchase an additional two percent ownership interest from huawei for an amount subject to negotiation by huawei and us  however  the original agreement provides that the amount shall not exceed million 
in april  we informed huawei that we were interested in beginning negotiations concerning our purchase of such additional ownership interest 
we are currently in the early stages of negotiating the terms of this transaction with huawei  including the purchase price  closing date and other material terms 
if this purchase is consummated  we will own a majority interest in the joint venture and expect to consolidate h c from the date of acquisition 
our purchase of such shares is subject to regulatory approval by the chinese government  as well as the successful negotiation of the terms of the purchase between us and huawei 
although we have begun negotiations with huawei  there can be no assurance that regulatory approval will be granted  that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms with huawei  or that the transaction will be consummated at all 
both partners have the right to purchase all of the other partner s ownership interest through a bid process at any time after the third anniversary of h c s formation 
in china  japan  and hong kong  h c sells its own products  as well as products it purchases directly from huawei and us 
outside of china  japan  and hong kong  we resell h c s products under the com brand 
through this reseller agreement  we are expanding our product line to include router products and modular switching products 
the addition of these products to our product portfolio increases the size of the market opportunity for which we can compete 
during fiscal  we undertook several additional actions that we believe will enhance our competitiveness  execution and profitability over the longer term 
we are implementing a strategy to compete in all sizes of the enterprise networking market  through the following continued advances in products  increased focus on our customer facing capabilities in the areas of sales and marketing  and service improvements 
we have introduced multiple new products targeted at the large enterprise market  including modular switches and routers sourced from h c  as well as voip  security and wireless solutions 
we also continue to develop solutions for the small to medium enterprise market  including voip  smart switches  and power over ethernet technology 
we have also increased our focus on sales and marketing activities 
current initiatives include developing an expanded set of enterprise class channels to support effective sales into the large enterprise market  and implementing marketing programs that we believe will improve our effectiveness and productivity in our existing channels  particularly those that target small and mid sized businesses 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we entered an agreement with siemens business services to provide expanded service offerings on a global basis for enterprise customers 
on january   we acquired tippingpoint technologies  inc tippingpoint  a provider of network based intrusion prevention systems 
we believe the acquired technologies are uniquely qualified to protect a converged voice and data environment 
we believe our acquisition of those technologies will expand our ability to design innovative and reliable voice  data and security solutions 
summary of fiscal financial performance our sales for fiscal were million  a seven percent decrease from fiscal sales of million 
sales from our enterprise networking products for fiscal were million  a two percent increase from fiscal sales of million 
our gross margin improved from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal our operating expenses in fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal  a net decrease of million 
restructuring charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal were included in operating expenses 
our net loss in fiscal was million compared to a net loss in fiscal of million 
our balance sheet remains strong with cash and short term investment balances at the end of fiscal of million  compared to cash and short term investment balances of  million at the end of fiscal business environment and future trends networking industry analysts and participants differ widely in their assessments concerning the prospects for near term industry growth 
industry factors and trends also present significant challenges in the medium term with respect to our goals for sales growth  gross margin improvement and profitability 
such factors and trends include intense competition in the market for higher end  enterprise core routing and switching products  aggressive product pricing by competitors targeted at gaining share in market segments where we have had a strong position historically  such as the small to medium sized enterprise market  and the advanced nature and ready availability of merchant silicon  which allows low end competitors to deliver competitive products and makes it increasingly difficult for us to differentiate our products 
our key focus for fiscal is on execution of our business plan to enhance our go to market capabilities and grow sales 
during fiscal  we continue to face significant challenges with respect to sales growth  gross margin and profitability 
future sales growth for our company depends on increased sales of our enterprise networking products  and our largest growth opportunity continues to be linked to the expansion of our product lines targeting mid to large enterprise customers 
in order to achieve our sales goals for fiscal  it is imperative that we continue to enhance the features and capabilities of these products in a timely manner in order to expand our addressable market opportunities  distribution channels and market competitiveness 
also  we expect a very competitive  difficult pricing environment for the foreseeable future  this will exert downward pressure on our sales  gross margin and profitability 
our planned actions for fiscal are based on certain assumptions concerning the overall economic outlook for the markets in which we operate  the expected demand for enterprise networking products  our ability to compete effectively and gain market share  and the cost and expense structure of our business 
these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate 
if current economic conditions deteriorate  or if our planned actions are not successful in achieving our goals  there could be additional adverse impacts on our financial position  sales  profitability or cash flows 
in that case  we might need to modify our strategic focus and restructure our business again to realign our resources and achieve additional cost and expense savings 
we are committed to our objective of being a leading provider of secure  converged networking solutions for small  medium and large enterprises 
we believe that our recent initiatives and our business strategy are consistent with our goals of growth and profitability over the longer term 
basis of presentation our fiscal year ends on the friday closest to may fiscal consisted of weeks and ended on june  fiscal years and each consisted of weeks and fiscal ended on may  and fiscal ended on may  for convenience  the consolidated financial statements have been shown as ending on the last day of the calendar month 
we account for our investment in h c by the equity method 
under this method  we record our proportionate share of h c s net income or loss based on the most recently available quarterly financial statements of h c under the caption equity interest in loss of unconsolidated joint venture in our consolidated financial statements 
since h c has adopted a calendar year basis of reporting  we have reported our equity in h c s net loss for h c s fiscal period from april  through march  in our results of operations for fiscal and from the date of formation november  through march  in our results of operations for fiscal our acquisition of tippingpoint on january   was accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the assets purchased and liabilities assumed are included in the consolidated balance sheet as of may  the operating results of tippingpoint are included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are outlined in 
note to the consolidated financial statements  which appear in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported by us 
the following items require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation revenue recognition we recognize a sale when the product has been delivered and risk of loss has passed to the customer  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the fee is fixed or determinable 
the assessment of whether the fee is fixed or determinable considers whether a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms 
if we determine that the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue at the time the fee becomes due  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
also  sales arrangements may contain customer specific acceptance requirements for both products and services 
in such cases  revenue is deferred at the time of delivery of the product or service and is recognized upon receipt of customer acceptance 
for arrangements that involve multiple elements  such as sales of products that include maintenance or installation services  revenue is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element have been met 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of all the undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including general economic and market conditions  past transaction history with the customer  and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of the fee is not reasonably assured  then we defer the fee and recognize revenue upon receipt of payment 
we do not typically request collateral from our customers 
a significant portion of our sales is made to distributors and value added resellers vars 
revenue is generally recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
sales to these customers are recorded net of appropriate allowances  including estimates for product returns  price protection  and excess channel inventory levels 
we maintain reserves for potential allowances and adjustments  if the actual level of returns and adjustments differ from the assumptions we use to develop those reserves  additional allowances and charges might be required 
for sales of products that contain software that is marketed separately  we apply the provisions of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
sales of services  including professional services  system integration  project management  and training  are recognized upon delivery and completion of performance 
other service revenue  such as that related to maintenance and support contracts  is recognized ratably over the contract term  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
royalty revenue is generally recognized when we receive payment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts  we take into account various factors including our accounts receivable aging  customer creditworthiness  historical bad debts  and geographic and political risk 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates cost  or net realizable value 
we perform detailed reviews related to the net realizable value of inventory on an ongoing basis  for both inventory on hand and inventory that we are committed to purchase  giving consideration to deterioration  obsolescence  and other factors 
if actual market conditions differ from those projected by management and our estimates prove to be inaccurate  additional write downs or adjustments to cost of sales might be required  alternatively  we might realize benefits through cost of sales for sale or disposition of inventory that had been previously written off 
goodwill and intangible assets carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for possible impairment in accordance with the applicable accounting literature 
we test our goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
we review the value of our intangible assets  in accordance with the applicable accounting literature for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
as of may   we had million of goodwill and million of net intangible assets remaining on the balance sheet  which we believe to be realizable based on the estimated fair value of these assets 
we estimate fair value of goodwill using quoted market prices and the fair value of our intangible assets using estimated future cash flows of the associated products and technology 
it is possible that the estimates and assumptions used in assessing the carrying value of these assets  such as future sales and expense levels  may need to be reevaluated in the case of continued market deterioration  which could result in further impairment of these assets 
equity securities and other investments we account for non marketable equity securities and other investments at historical cost or  if we have the ability to exert significant influence over the investee  by the equity method 
investments accounted for by the equity method include investments in limited partnership venture capital funds and our investment in h c 
in accounting for these investments by the equity method  we record our proportionate share of the fund s net income or loss  or h c s net income or loss  based on the most recently available quarterly financial statements 
since h c has adopted a calendar year basis of reporting  we report our equity in h c s net income or loss based on h c s most recent quarterly financial statements  two months in arrears 
we review all of our investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be fully recoverable 
the impairment review requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
investments identified as having an indication of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the impairment is other than temporary  in the event that the indicated impairment is other than temporary  we write the investment down to its impaired value 
restructuring charges over the last several years we have undertaken significant restructuring initiatives 
these initiatives have required us to record restructuring charges related to severance and outplacement costs  lease cancellations  accelerated depreciation and write downs of held for sale properties  write downs of other long term assets  and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of our restructuring activities and the time required for execution and completion of such activities  the process of estimating restructuring charges is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
the accounting for restructuring costs and asset impairments requires us to record charges when we have taken actions or have the appropriate approval for taking action  and when a liability is incurred 
our policies require us to continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
as we continue to evaluate the business  we might be required to record additional charges for new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded 
warranty a limited warranty is provided on our products for periods ranging from days to limited lifetime  depending upon the product  and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale 
the determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty 
if actual return rates and or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales might be required 
income taxes we are subject to income tax in a number of jurisdictions 
a certain degree of estimation is required in recording the assets and liabilities related to income taxes  and it is reasonably possible that such assets may not be recovered and that such liabilities may not be paid or that payments in excess of amounts initially estimated and accrued may be required 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from our future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider historical taxable income  estimates of future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
based on various factors  including our recent losses  retained deficit  operating performance in fiscal  and estimates of future profitability  we have concluded that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be insufficient to recover our us net deferred tax assets as of may  accordingly  we have established an appropriate valuation allowance to offset such deferred tax assets 
in addition to valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  we maintain reserves for potential tax contingencies arising in jurisdictions in which we do or have done business 
many of these contingencies arise from periods when we were a substantially larger company 
such reserves are based on our assessment of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the expected potential loss from such contingency  and are monitored by management 
these reserves are maintained until such time as the matter is settled or the statutory period for adjustment has passed 
adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that the amount to be realized is greater or less than the valuation allowance we have recorded or that our reserves for tax contingencies are inadequate 
results of operations years ended may    and as mentioned above  effective at the beginning of fiscal  we began managing and reporting our operations as a single  integrated business

comparison of fiscal and sales the following table shows our sales from enterprise networking products and desktop  mobile and server connectivity products in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total sales for fiscal and fiscal in millions fiscal year enterprise networking desktop  mobile and server connectivity total sales of enterprise networking products in fiscal increased two percent from fiscal the increase in sales was primarily driven by certain products in targeted high growth technology areas  such products included fixed configuration gigabit switches  wireless lan  and modular switches and routers sourced from h c 
increased sales of these products was largely due to higher unit volumes  resulting from both the industry shift towards gigabit switching solutions mentioned above  as well as enhanced sales and marketing efforts targeting enterprise customers 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in average selling prices resulting from significant price competition  particularly for our mbps switching products as the industry migrates to gigabit switching solutions  and by a shift in mix towards lower priced products 
sales of our desktop  mobile and server connectivity products in fiscal decreased percent from fiscal the decrease in such sales was due largely to lower volumes as well as to lower overall average selling prices in fiscal compared to the previous fiscal year 
we believe the lower volumes resulted from a continuing shift in technology from traditional network interface card nic  personal computer pc card  and mini peripheral component interconnect mini pci form factors to pc chipsets with embedded networking technology for which we have lower market share 
we expect sales from desktop  mobile and server connectivity products to decline again in fiscal due to both reduced demand for our products and continued pricing pressures 
the additional week included in fiscal did not have a significant impact on sales  compared to fiscal sales by geographic region are as follows in millions fiscal year americas europe  middle east  and africa asia pacific total sales information by geography is reported based on the customer s designated delivery point 
international sales in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal the major factor contributing to this decrease was lower sales of our desktop  mobile and server connectivity products  other important factors contributing to the decrease were lower sales of mbps switching products  as well as a decline in sales to customers in china  japan  and hong kong following h c s assumption of responsibility for sales of products into these territories 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales improved percentage points from percent of sales in fiscal to percent of sales in fiscal significant components of the improvement in gross margins were as follows outsourced manufacturing and facility closure it and facilities related expenses volume related impacts other total gross margin benefited compared to fiscal due to effects associated with our decision to outsource our remaining manufacturing operations in dublin  ireland during fiscal in addition to the absence of impairment and transition costs that were incurred in fiscal and not in fiscal  these actions also resulted in lower operating costs 
we allocate and report both it and facilities related expenses as a component of cost of sales and operating expenses 
the portion of such expenses allocated to cost of sales decreased in fiscal due to the outsourcing of our it operations 
volume related impacts include higher post sale technical support costs  manufacturing overhead costs  royalty fees and warranty costs as a percent of sales 
these costs did not decline at the same rate as sales since a portion of these costs is not directly variable with sales 
in the second quarter of fiscal we entered into an agreement to contract with siemens business services and enhance our customer service offerings 
this agreement resulted in transition costs in fiscal that were not incurred in fiscal operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal  a net decrease of million 
included in the net decrease in operating expenses were decreases in restructuring charges of million  general and administrative expenses of million  sales and marketing expenses of million and research and development expenses of approximately million 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases in in process research and development expenses of million and amortization and write down of intangibles of million 
as a percent of sales  total operating expenses in fiscal were percent  compared to percent in fiscal in aggregate  sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses were percent of sales in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal  and decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal to a significant degree  these expenses are controllable and discretionary over time  but they are not directly variable with sales levels within a particular period 
the most significant component of the decrease of million was a reduction of it related expenses 
we allocate and report both it and facilities related expenses as a component of cost of sales and operating expenses 
on an overall basis  total operating expenses in fiscal reflected a decrease of million in it related expenses compared to fiscal  largely as a result of employee reductions and asset write offs associated with our it outsourcing initiatives during fiscal a more detailed discussion of the factors affecting each major component of total operating expenses is provided below 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percent of sales increased to percent in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal the most significant factors in the million decrease were reduced it expenses  as well as reduced workforce related and facilities related expenses due to our restructuring initiatives 
largely offsetting these decreases were higher marketing expenses and travel and entertainment expenses 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal research and development expenses as a percent of sales increased to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the most significant factors in the million decrease were reduced it and facilities related expenses and reduced workforce expenses as a result of restructuring activities and movement towards lower cost geographies 
partially offsetting these reductions were increased use of third parties for development work  as well as an increase in facilities related expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased million  or percent  from fiscal as a percent of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the most significant factors in the million decrease were reduced workforce related expenses due to our restructuring initiatives  reduced professional services and legal costs relating to fiscal non recurring formation costs associated with h c  and reduced it and facilities related expenses 
partially offsetting these reductions were lower credits in fiscal relating to bad debt expense 
amortization and write down of intangibles 
amortization and write down of intangibles were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  an increase of million 
amortization and write down of intangibles increased due to million of purchased intangibles acquired in the tippingpoint acquisition in fiscal that are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of between two and six years 
partially offsetting this increase was a reduction in impairment charges 
in fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to developed and core technology associated with the acquisition of assets from alteon in fiscal and million related to developed and core technology associated with the fiscal acquisition of nbx 
in fiscal  impairment charges totaled million and solely related to the developed and core technology associated with nbx 
in process research and development 
million of the total purchase price of tippingpoint has been allocated to in process research and development and was expensed in the third quarter of fiscal projects that qualify as in process research and development represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use 
at the time of acquisition  tippingpoint had multiple in process research and development efforts under way for certain current and future product lines 
we utilized the multi period excess earnings method to value the in process research and development 
at the time of acquisition  it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next twelve months at an estimated cost of approximately million 
additionally  we incurred million of in process research and development expenses related to technology assets purchased during the first quarter of fiscal restructuring charges 
restructuring charges were million in fiscal and million in fiscal restructuring charges in fiscal were composed primarily of charges for actions taken in fiscal  including severance and outplacement costs of million  long term asset write downs and other costs of million and facilities related charges of million 
restructuring charges for fiscal were the result of reductions in workforce and continued efforts to consolidate and dispose of excess facilities 
additionally  in fiscal we recognized a benefit of million primarily relating to a reduction in severance and outplacement costs partially offset by additional facilities related charges for the completion of restructuring activities initiated in fiscal years   and restructuring charges in fiscal were composed primarily of charges for actions taken in fiscal  including facilities related charges of million  severance and outplacement costs of million  and long term asset write downs and other costs of million 
facilities related charges in fiscal included million for an impairment and accelerated depreciation of a santa clara facility due to our plan to vacate the facility and move to a smaller santa clara facility already owned  offset by a million gain on the sale of this vacated facility later in fiscal  million for an impairment and accelerated depreciation of our dublin manufacturing facility  an million impairment and million loss on sale of certain other santa clara properties  a loss of million related to the sale of our rolling meadows  illinois facility  charges of million related to fair value adjustments of properties classified as held for sale prior to fiscal  and million related to estimated lease obligation costs 
restructuring charges for fiscal were the result of reductions in workforce  outsourcing of our remaining manufacturing operations in dublin  and efforts to consolidate and dispose of excess facilities 
additionally  in fiscal we incurred charges of million relating to the completion of restructuring activities initiated in fiscal years   and further actions may be taken if our business activity declines and additional cost reduction efforts are necessary 
gain loss on investments  net during fiscal  net gains on investments were million  reflecting million of recognized gains from the sale of an investment in a privately held company and public traded securities partially offset by a net loss of million due to fair value adjustments of investments in limited partnership venture capital funds 
in fiscal  net losses on investments were million  reflecting million of write downs of long term equity investments partially offset by a gain of million recognized upon the sale of an investment in a privately held company 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  was million in fiscal  an increase of million compared to million in fiscal an increase in interest income accounted for million of this increase  primarily attributable to higher interest rates applicable to short term investments 
partially offsetting this increase was a provision of million for unrecoverable value added tax for prior years that was recorded in fiscal as a result of an unfavorable tax authority ruling 
income tax provision benefit our income tax provision was million in fiscal  compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal our income tax provision for fiscal was the result of providing for taxes in certain state and foreign jurisdictions  partially offset by the favorable resolution of an income tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction 
included in our fiscal income tax benefit was an million benefit of a foreign net operating loss carryback 
offsetting this benefit was a tax provision for tax in certain foreign and domestic state jurisdictions 
equity interest in loss of unconsolidated joint venture as described more fully above  we account for our investment in h c by the equity method 
in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million representing our share of the net loss from operations incurred by h c from april  through march  in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million representing our share of the net loss from operations incurred by h c from the date of formation through march  in addition  at the time of formation of h c  we recorded a charge of million representing our ownership share percent of the value attributed to in process technology contributed to h c by huawei that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
in fiscal  our total reported loss related to h c was million 
discontinued operations discontinued operations in fiscal related to our commworks division that was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a loss of million in fiscal due to adjustments to previous estimates of liabilities related to the sale of commworks 
comparison of fiscal and sales fiscal sales totaled million  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of million 
sales of enterprise networking products in fiscal were million  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of million 
the decrease in sales was driven by a reduction in average selling prices resulting from significant price competition  particularly for our mbps switching products as the industry migrates to gigabit switching solutions  and by an unfavorable shift in mix towards lower priced products 
although sales of enterprise networking products declined overall  sales of certain products in targeted high growth technology areas increased  such products included fixed configuration gigabit switches  wireless lan  and modular switches and routers sourced from h c 
increased sales of these products was largely due to higher unit volumes  resulting from both the industry shift towards gigabit switching solutions mentioned above  as well as enhanced sales and marketing efforts targeting enterprise customers 
enterprise networking products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal sales of our desktop  mobile and server connectivity products in fiscal were million  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of million 
the decrease in sales was due largely to lower volumes  with unit shipments decreasing percent compared to fiscal  as well as to lower overall average selling prices 
we believe the lower volumes resulted from a continuing shift in technology from traditional network interface card nic  personal computer pc card  and mini peripheral component interconnect mini pci form factors to pc chipsets with embedded networking technology for which we have lower market share 
additionally  the decline in sales was partially attributable to the recognition in fiscal of million of royalty sales from a paid up license resulting from settlement of patent litigation with xircom  inc sales of our desktop  mobile and server connectivity products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal sales by geographic region are as follows in millions fiscal year americas europe  middle east  and africa asia pacific total sales information by geography is reported based on the customer s designated delivery point 
international sales in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal the major factor contributing to this decrease was lower sales of desktop  mobile and server connectivity products  other important factors contributing to the decrease were lower sales of mbps switching products  as well as a decline in sales to customers in china and japan following h c s assumption of responsibility for sales of products into these territories 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales declined percentage points from percent of sales in fiscal to percent of sales in fiscal significant components of the decrease in gross margins were as follows decrease in standard related margin duty refunds and proceeds from inventory previously written off transition related costs associated with closure of the dublin manufacturing facility volume related impacts impact of royalty sales other total the decrease in standard related margin was primarily the result of lower average selling prices  and  to a lesser extent  an unfavorable shift in product mix 
these unfavorable factors were partially offset by product cost reductions 
gross margin in fiscal did not benefit to any significant degree from duty refunds or proceeds from the sale of inventory that was previously written off 
however  gross margin in fiscal included benefits related to such items 
we recorded charges related to manufacturing assets and other transition related costs in fiscal as a result of our decision to outsource our remaining manufacturing operations in dublin 
volume related impacts include higher post sale technical support costs  manufacturing overhead costs  and warranty costs as a percent of sales 
since a portion of these costs is not directly variable with sales  these costs did not decline at the same rate as sales 
sales in fiscal included royalty sales of million related to the settlement of litigation with xircom 
this transaction did not have any associated cost of sales 
operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal  a net decrease of million 
included in the net decrease in operating expenses were decreases in research and development expenses of approximately million  general and administrative expenses of million  amortization and write down of intangibles of million  restructuring charges of approximately million  and loss on land and facilities of million 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in sales and marketing expenses of million 
as a percent of sales  total operating expenses in fiscal were percent  compared to percent in fiscal in aggregate  sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses were percent of sales in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal  and decreased a net million in fiscal compared to fiscal the most significant component of the decrease of million was a reduction of it related expenses 
we allocate and report both it and facilities related expenses as a component of cost of sales and operating expenses 
on an overall basis  total operating expenses in fiscal reflected a decrease of million in it related expenses compared to fiscal  largely as a result of employee reductions and asset write offs associated with our it outsourcing initiatives during fiscal partially offsetting the decrease in it related expenses was a net increase of million in facilities related expenses 
although our facilities consolidation efforts have resulted in lower gross facilities spending  these savings have been more than offset by a reduction in rental and sublease income received 
such rental and sublease income totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and is recorded as an offset to the associated facilities related expenses 
a more detailed discussion of the factors affecting each major component of total operating expenses is provided below 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal were relatively flat compared to fiscal  increasing million 
sales and marketing expenses as a percent of sales increased to percent in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal the most significant factors in the increase were higher workforce related and travel and entertainment expenses and an increase in facilities related expenses 
largely offsetting these increases were reduced it expenses  as well as reduced marketing expenses as a result of a shift in spending towards more focused  product and channel specific programs 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal decreased million  or percent  compared to fiscal research and development expenses as a percent of sales increased to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the most significant factors in the decrease were reduced it expenses  reduced workforce expenses as a result of restructuring activities and movement towards lower cost geographies  lower depreciation expense related to engineering assets reflecting write downs and disposals associated with our restructuring initiatives  and decreased spending for project tools and materials 
partially offsetting these reductions were increased use of third parties for development work  as well as an increase in facilities related expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased million  or percent  from fiscal as a percent of sales  general and administrative expenses were relatively flat  increasing to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the most significant factors in the decrease were reduced workforce related expenses due to our restructuring initiatives  reduced legal and professional services costs related to the formation of h c  and reduced it expenses 
partially offsetting these reductions was the impact of sales tax refunds in fiscal that did not recur at the same level in fiscal  as well as lower credits in fiscal relating to bad debt expense 
amortization and write down of intangibles 
amortization and write down of intangibles were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
amortization and write down of intangibles decreased due to a lower base of intangible assets as a result of an impairment charge during the first quarter of fiscal  as well as reduced impairment charges 
in fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to developed and core technology associated with the acquisition of assets from alteon in fiscal additionally  there were impairment charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal  related to developed and core technology associated with the fiscal acquisition of nbx 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges were million in fiscal and million in fiscal restructuring charges in fiscal were composed primarily of charges for actions taken in fiscal  including facilities related charges of million  severance and outplacement costs of million  and long term asset write downs and other costs of million 
facilities related charges in fiscal included million for an impairment and accelerated depreciation of a santa clara facility due to our plan to vacate the facility and move to a smaller santa clara facility already owned  offset by a million gain on the sale of this vacated facility later in fiscal  million for an impairment and accelerated depreciation of our dublin manufacturing facility  an million impairment and million loss on sale of certain other santa clara properties  a loss of million related to the sale of our rolling meadows  illinois facility  charges of million related to fair value adjustments of properties classified as held for sale prior to fiscal  and million related to estimated lease obligation costs 
restructuring charges for fiscal were the result of reductions in workforce  outsourcing of our remaining manufacturing operations in dublin  and continued efforts to consolidate and dispose of excess facilities 
additionally  in fiscal we incurred charges of million relating to the completion of restructuring activities initiated in fiscal years  and restructuring charges in fiscal were composed primarily of charges for actions taken in fiscal relating to accelerated depreciation and write downs of facilities of million  severance and outplacement costs of million  and long term asset write downs and other costs of million 
facilities charges in fiscal included million for write downs of facilities located in rolling meadows  santa clara  ireland  and the uk  accelerated depreciation of million on certain santa clara facilities  a million loss on the sale of our marlborough  massachusetts facility  and lease obligation costs of million 
restructuring charges in fiscal were the result of the consolidation of our real estate portfolio  the integration of the support infrastructure of our former connectivity and enterprise networking segments  it outsourcing efforts  and continued cost reduction actions 
additionally  in fiscal we incurred charges of million relating to the completion of restructuring activities initiated in fiscal years and as of may   the aggregate net realizable value of properties held for sale was million  and included properties located in ireland and the uk loss on investments  net during fiscal  net losses on investments were million  reflecting million of write downs of long term equity investments partially offset by a gain of million recognized upon the sale of an investment in a privately held company 
in fiscal  net losses on investments were million  including million of net losses recognized due to fair value adjustments of investments in limited partnership venture capital funds and write downs of investments in private companies for other than temporary declines in value and million of net losses realized on sales of publicly traded equity securities and investments in limited partnership venture capital funds 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  was million in fiscal  a decrease of million compared to million in fiscal a decline in interest income accounted for million of this decline  primarily driven by lower interest rates applicable to short term investments and lower interest income relating to income tax refunds 
we collected interest income of million in fiscal and million in fiscal  relating to income tax refunds received in those years 
partially offsetting the decrease in interest income was lower interest expense that resulted from the repayment of borrowings  as well as lower charges related to warrants issued to broadcom corporation broadcom 
in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million in interest and other income  net  related to a one year extension of the expiration date for the broadcom warrants that was agreed to in connection with our settlement of litigation with broadcom 
these warrants expired unexercised in december income tax provision benefit our income tax benefit was million in fiscal  compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal included in our fiscal income tax benefit was an million benefit of a foreign net operating loss carryback 
offsetting this benefit was a tax provision for tax in certain foreign and domestic state jurisdictions 
included in our fiscal income tax benefit was a million benefit of a net operating loss carryback made possible by the job creation and worker assistance act of  and a million benefit that was recorded to offset the net tax provision for discontinued operations 
offsetting these benefits was a tax provision for certain foreign and domestic state jurisdictions 
equity interest in loss of unconsolidated joint venture in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million representing our share of the net loss from operations incurred by h c from the date of formation through march  in addition  at the time of formation of h c  we recorded a charge of million representing our ownership share percent of the value attributed to in process technology contributed to h c by huawei that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
in fiscal  our total reported loss related to h c was million 
discontinued operations discontinued operations in fiscal and fiscal related to our commworks division that was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a loss of million in fiscal due to adjustments to previous estimates of liabilities related to the sale of commworks 
discontinued operations in fiscal included a gain on the sale of commworks of million  which was offset by million of taxes 
also included in fiscal were losses from operations of million  which were offset by a million tax benefit 
liquidity and capital resources cash and equivalents and short term investments as of may  were million  a decrease of approximately million compared to the balance of  million as of may  the following table shows the major components of our statements of cash flows for the last three fiscal years in millions years ended may  cash and equivalents  beginning of period net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities other cash and equivalents  end of period net cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal  primarily reflecting our loss from continuing operations of million 
we expect that cash flows from operating activities will continue to be negative during fiscal  and possibly longer  primarily due to continuing net losses 
there are no assurances that we can reduce our net losses and negative cash flow in the foreseeable future  or that we can raise capital as needed to fund our operations on an ongoing basis 
however  based on current business conditions and our current operating and financial plans  but subject to the discussion in business environment and industry trends below  we believe that our existing cash and equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months 
we expect the aforementioned fiscal restructuring actions and related charges to result in an improvement to our cash flow from operations of approximately million per quarter during fiscal this improvement excludes the impact of cash disbursements to be made in settlement of liabilities accrued as of may  significant commitments that will require the use of cash in future periods include obligations under lease  contract manufacturing and outsourcing agreements  as shown in the following table in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than years operating leases 




purchase commitments with contract manufacturers 

outsourcing agreements 




total 




we have entered into purchase agreements with our contract manufacturers 
pursuant to these agreements  if our actual orders and purchases fall below forecasted levels  we may be required to purchase finished goods inventory manufactured to meet our requirements 
in addition  we may be required to purchase raw material and work in process inventory on hand that is unique to our products  and we may be required to compensate the contract manufacturers with respect to their non cancelable purchase orders for such inventory 
the amount shown in the table above represents our estimate of inventory held by contract manufacturers as of may  that we could be required to purchase within the next months 
we do not expect any such required purchases to exceed our requirements for inventory to meet expected sales of our products to our customers 
under our customer service and it outsourcing agreements  we are subject to service level commitments providing for annual minimum payments that vary depending on the service levels we choose 
the amounts shown in the table above represent the amounts that would be payable  based on current service levels  through the expiration of the agreements 
however  these agreements may be terminated at any time upon days notice 
our customer service agreement is subject to early termination penalties that decline over time 
two years after formation of h c  we have the one time option to purchase an additional two percent ownership interest from huawei for an amount subject to negotiation by huawei and us  however  the original agreement provides that the amount shall not exceed million 
in april  we informed huawei that we were interested in beginning negotiations concerning our purchase of such additional ownership interest 
we are currently in the early stages of negotiating the terms of this transaction with huawei  including the purchase price  closing date and other material terms 
if this purchase is consummated  we will own a majority interest in the joint venture and expect to consolidate h c from the date of acquisition 
our purchase of such shares is subject to regulatory approval by the chinese government  as well as the successful negotiation of the terms of the purchase between us and huawei 
although we have begun negotiations with huawei  there can be no assurance that regulatory approval will be granted  that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms with huawei  or that the transaction will be consummated at all 
both partners have the right to purchase all of the other partner s ownership interest through a bid process at any time after the third anniversary of h c s formation 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  including approximately million for the acquisition of tippingpoint and million of outflows related to the purchase of property and equipment 
these outflows were offset by million of net proceeds from the sale of property and equipment  primarily our dublin and hemel hempstead facilities  and million of net proceeds related to purchases  sales and maturities of debt and equity securities 
we made investments totaling million in fiscal and million in fiscal  in municipal and corporate bonds and government agency instruments  as well as investments totaling million in fiscal and million in fiscal  in equity securities 
proceeds from maturities and sales of municipal and corporate bonds and government agency instruments were million in fiscal and  million in fiscal  and proceeds from the sales of equity investments totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal we selectively make strategic investments in privately held companies and in limited partnership venture capital funds  which in turn invest in privately held companies 
these investment activities are entered into with the intention of complementing our business strategies and research and development efforts  and may include a strategic commercial or technology relationship  such as a component supply agreement or technology license arrangement  with these privately held companies 
we made strategic investments of million in fiscal and have committed to make additional capital contributions to venture capital funds totaling million 
we are contractually obligated to provide funding upon calls for capital 
the expiration dates for such capital calls are generally five to eight years from the inception of the fund  and the amounts and timing of such calls during that period are at the discretion of the funds general partners 
we estimate that we will pay approximately million over the next months as capital calls are made 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal  which includes repurchases of million shares of our common stock at a total cost of million during the first quarter of fiscal these repurchases were made pursuant to the stock repurchase program that was approved by our board of directors in march  and that authorized expenditures of up to million during a two year period through march there were no repurchases during the second  third or fourth quarters of fiscal on march   our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program providing for expenditures of up to million through march  under the new stock repurchase program  we may repurchase shares of our common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to million in the open market  in privately negotiated transactions with shareholders or using derivate transactions  provided  however  that all repurchases must be pre approved by the audit and finance committee of the board of directors 
there is no requirement that we repurchase shares under the program and the program may be discontinued at any time 
additionally  during the third fiscal quarter we repaid the total borrowings of million that we assumed in connection with the acquisition of tippingpoint 
during november  our revolving line of credit agreement expired according to its terms 
during the third fiscal quarter  we entered a new agreement facilitating the issuance of standby letters of credit and bank guarantees required in the normal course of business 
as of may   such bank issued standby letters of credit and guarantees totaled million  including million relating to potential foreign tax  custom  and duty assessments 
during fiscal  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock in connection with our employee stock purchase and option plans with total proceeds from such issuances of million 
as of may   our outstanding stock options as a percentage of outstanding shares were percent

business environment and industry trends industry trends and specific risks may affect our future business and results 
the matters discussed below could cause our future results to differ from past results or those described in forward looking statements and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and stock price 
we have incurred significant net losses in recent fiscal periods  including million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal  and we may not be able to return to profitability 
we incurred a net loss of million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal although we are taking steps designed to improve our results of operations  we cannot assure you that we will return to profitability 
we have faced a number of challenges that have affected our operating results during the current and past several fiscal years 
specifically  we have experienced  and may continue to experience  the following declining sales due to price competition and reduced incoming order rate  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories  excess facilities  operating expenses that  as a percentage of sales  have exceeded our desired financial model  and disruptions resulting from our workforce reductions and employee attrition 
we focus primarily on enterprise networking  and our results of operations may fluctuate based on factors related entirely to conditions in this market 
in fiscal  we began focusing primarily on enterprise networking 
this focus reflects a streamlined management and operating structure encompassing all of our operations 
our focus on enterprise networking may cause increased risk or volatility associated with decreased diversification of our business 
there will be increased sensitivity to the business risks associated specifically with the enterprise networking market and our ability to execute successfully on our strategies to provide superior solutions for larger and multi site enterprise environments 
to be successful in the enterprise networking market  we will need to overcome negative perceptions of our company held by decision making officers of large enterprises  who may be skeptical of our long term commitment to the high end networking business as a result of our withdrawal from certain portions of that business in fiscal also  expansion of sales to large enterprises may be disruptive in a variety of ways  such as adding larger systems integrators that may raise channel conflict issues with existing distributors  or a perception of diminished focus on the small and medium enterprise market 
we may not respond effectively to increased competition caused by industry volatility and consolidation 
our business could be seriously harmed if we do not compete effectively 
we face competitive challenges that are likely to arise from a number of factors  including the following industry volatility resulting from rapid product development cycles  increasing price competition due to maturation of basic networking technologies  industry consolidation resulting in competitors with greater financial  marketing  and technical resources  and the presence of existing competitors with greater financial resources together with the potential emergence of new competitors with lower cost structures and more competitive offerings 
we may not be able to compensate for lower sales or unexpected cash outlays with cost reductions sufficient to generate positive net income or cash flow 
although we have implemented cost and expense reductions  if we are unable to achieve our growth objectives  we will need to further reduce costs which may in turn reduce our sales 
if we are not able to effectively reduce our costs and expenses  we may not be able to generate positive net income or cash flow from operations 
if we continue to experience negative cash flow from operations over a prolonged period of time or if we suffer unexpected cash outflows  our liquidity and ability to operate our business effectively could be adversely affected 
for example  our ability to raise financial capital may be hindered due to the possibility of continuing net losses and negative cash flow in the future 
an inability to raise financial capital could limit our operating flexibility 
we are unable to predict the exact amount of cost reductions required for us to generate positive net income or cash flow from operations because it is difficult to predict the amount of our future sales and gross margins 
the amount of our future sales depends  in part  on future economic and market conditions  which are difficult to forecast accurately 
efforts to reduce operating expenses could involve further workforce reductions and lead to reduced sales and other disruptions in our business 
our operating expenses as a percent of sales continue to be higher than our desired long term financial model 
we have taken  and will continue to take  actions to reduce these expenses 
such future actions could include further reductions in our workforce  relocation of functions and activities to lower cost locations  changes or modifications in it systems or applications  or process reengineering 
as a result of these actions  the employment of some employees with critical skills might be terminated  and other employees might leave our company voluntarily due to the uncertainties associated with our business environment and their job security 
in addition  reductions in overall staffing levels might make it more difficult for us to achieve our growth objectives  to adhere to our preferred business practices and to address all of our legal and regulatory obligations in an effective manner  which could  in turn  ultimately lead to missed business opportunities  higher operating costs or penalties 
if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes  our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected 
our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process 
we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future 
if we fail to continue to implement improved systems and processes  our ability to manage our business and results of operation could be adversely affected 
we entered into a joint venture in china with huawei that  if not successful  could materially and adversely impact our business  business prospects and operating results 
in november  we formed a joint venture for enterprise networking products with huawei  a leading chinese communications equipment provider 
we currently have a percent minority interest in h c  which is domiciled in hong kong and has its principal operations in hangzhou  china 
in april we notified huawei of our interest to begin negotiations concerning our option to purchase an additional two percent of the joint venture  following which  we would own percent of the joint venture 
pursuant to the joint venture agreements  as amended and supplemented in the first quarter of fiscal  we have the right to market and support the h c products under the com brand in all countries except china  japan  and hong kong 
the joint venture sells products sourced internally as well as from com and huawei under h c s brand as well as the com brand and the huawei brand directly in china  japan  and hong kong 
the business of h c is subject to all of the operational risks that normally arise for a technology company with global operations pertaining to research and development  manufacturing  sales  service  marketing  and corporate functions 
in addition  there could be disagreements between com and huawei with respect to important strategic and operational decisions 
a key factor in the success of h c is that products sourced from it remain competitive over time particularly with respect to features  performance  quality and cost 
another factor that could affect cost competitiveness is future adverse exchange rate movements between h c s local currency of operations and the us dollar 
our business  business prospects and operating results have dependencies upon the success of h c 
in particular  our product development activities will become increasingly interdependent with those of h c 
if h c and our transactions with it are not successful  we may not introduce new products needed to broaden our high end enterprise networking product line  which may adversely affect our sales and overall results of operations 
also  if h c enters into original equipment manufacturer oem agreements with companies who compete with us  we could face increased competition in the markets in which we operate 
we may pursue acquisitions of other companies that  if not successful  could adversely affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
the networking business is highly competitive 
as a result  our success is dependent  in part  on our ability to meet the needs of customers and markets by enhancing the functional capabilities of our existing products and solutions  and introducing new products and solutions  on a timely basis 
our efforts to enhance existing offerings and develop new offerings include the following internal research and development activities  the h c joint venture and other strategic relationships  and acquisitions 
on january   we completed our acquisition of tippingpoint 
in the future  we may pursue additional acquisitions of other companies with established market access and position or promising technology and products to enhance our existing capabilities 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following potential difficulties related to integrating the technologies  products and operations of the acquired company  failure to operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resources practices  diverting management s attention from the normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in process research and development  entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  and an uncertain sales and earnings stream from the acquired company  which may result in unexpected dilution to our earnings 
there can be no assurances that our acquisition of tippingpoint or other acquisitions that we might pursue will be successful 
if we pursue an acquisition but are not successful in completing it  or if we complete an acquisition but are not successful in integrating the acquired company s technology  employees  products or operations successfully  our business  financial position or results of operations could be adversely affected 
we expect to utilize strategic relationships and other alliances as key elements in our strategy 
if we are not successful in forming desired ventures and alliances or if such ventures and alliances are not successful  our ability to achieve our growth and profitability goals could be adversely affected 
we have announced alliances with third parties  such as aspect communications corporation  crossbeam systems  inc  electronic data systems corporation  trapeze networks and siemens business services 
our relationship with crossbeam systems  inc terminated 
these and other alliances that may be created over time cannot be assured of generating growth or profitability 
in the future  we expect to evaluate other possible strategic relationships  including joint ventures and other types of alliances  and we may increase our reliance on such strategic relationships to broaden our sales channels  complement internal development of new technologies and enhancement of existing products  and exploit perceived market opportunities 
strategic relationships can present a number of challenges 
for example  we compete in business areas with companies with which we  at the same time  have strategic alliances in other business areas 
also  if we fail to form the number and quality of strategic relationships that we desire  or if such strategic relationships are not successful  we could suffer missed market opportunities  channel conflicts  delays in product development or delivery  or other operational difficulties 
further  if third parties acquire our strategic partners or if our competitors enter into successful strategic relationships  we may face increased competition 
any of these difficulties could have an adverse effect on our future sales and results of operations 
our strategy of outsourcing functions and operations may fail to reduce cost and may disrupt our operations 
we continue to look for ways to decrease cost and improve efficiency by contracting with other companies to perform functions or operations that  in the past  we have performed ourselves 
during fiscal  we completed the outsourcing of all manufacturing of our products 
we now rely on outside vendors to meet all of our manufacturing needs as well as a significant portion of our it needs 
additionally  in the second quarter of fiscal  we announced an initiative to expand our service offerings with siemens business services 
to achieve future cost savings or operational benefits  we may expand our outsourcing activities to cover additional services which we believe a third party may be able to provide in a more efficient or effective manner than we could do internally ourselves 
although we believe that outsourcing will result in lower costs and increased efficiencies  this may not be the case 
because these third parties may not be as responsive to our needs as we would be ourselves  outsourcing increases the risk of disruption to our operations 
in addition  our agreements with these third parties sometimes include substantial penalties for terminating such agreements early or failing to maintain minimum service levels 
because we cannot always predict how long we will need the services or how much of the services we will use  we may have to pay these penalties or incur costs if our business conditions change 
we may not be successful at identifying and responding to new and emerging market and product opportunities  or at responding quickly enough to technologies or markets that are in decline 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technology transitions and short product life cycles 
therefore  our success depends on our ability to do the following identify new market and product opportunities  predict which technologies and markets will see declining demand  develop and introduce new products and solutions in a timely manner  gain market acceptance of new products and solutions  particularly in targeted emerging markets  and rapidly and efficiently transition our customers from older to newer enterprise networking technologies 
our financial position or results of operations could suffer if we are not successful in achieving these goals 
for example  our business would suffer if any of the following occurs there is a delay in introducing new products  our products do not satisfy customers in terms of features  functionality or quality  or our products cost more to produce than we expect 
our business would suffer if negative effects such as these were to occur 
one factor that may cause greater difficulty for us in quickly and effectively introducing new products with the features  functionality  quality  and costs that are optimal for the market is our reliance on relationships with strategic partners  such as original design manufacturers odms 
because odms manufacture the products of other companies as well as ours  the timeliness of the availability of our products depends  in part  on their production schedules 
in addition  we are relying on odms to manufacture products that meet our specifications with regard to quality and cost 
we will continue to source other products from oems and from h c 
finally  since we rely on our strategic partners  we may not be able to independently identify current product and technology trends or to respond to such trends as well as if we were working independently 
our reliance on industry standards  technological change in the marketplace  and new product initiatives may cause our sales to fluctuate or decline 
the enterprise networking industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid changes in technology and customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
as a result  our success depends on the timely adoption and market acceptance of industry standards  and timely resolution of conflicting us and international industry standards  and our ability to influence the development of emerging industry standards and to introduce new and enhanced products that are compatible with such standards 
slow market acceptance of new technologies  products  or industry standards could adversely affect our sales or overall results of operations 
in addition  if our technology is not included in an industry standard on a timely basis or if we fail to achieve timely certification of compliance to industry standards for our products  our sales of such products or our overall results of operations could be adversely affected 
a significant portion of our sales is derived from a small number of resellers 
if any of these partners reduces its business with us  our business could be seriously harmed 
we distribute many of our products through two tier distribution channels that include distributors  systems integrators and vars 
a significant portion of our sales is concentrated among a few distributors  our two largest distributors accounted for a combined percent of total sales for fiscal and a combined percent of total sales for both fiscal and fiscal if either of these distributors reduces its business with us  our sales and overall results of operations could be adversely affected 
we depend on distributors who maintain inventories of our products 
if the distributors reduce their inventories of our products  our sales could be adversely affected 
our distributors maintain inventories of our products 
we work closely with our distributors to monitor channel inventory levels and ensure that appropriate levels of products are available to resellers and end users 
we have improved certain elements of our supply chain processes so that deliveries to our channel partners can be done more rapidly  thereby enabling our channel partners to hold fewer weeks of supply of our products in their inventory 
our target range for channel inventory levels is between four and five weeks of supply on hand at our distributors 
partners with a below average inventory level may incur stock outs that would adversely impact our sales 
if our channel partners further reduce their levels of inventory of our products  our sales would be negatively impacted during the period of change 
if we are unable to successfully develop relationships with system integrators  service providers  and enterprise vars  our sales may be negatively affected as part of our sales strategy  we are targeting system integrators sis  service providers sps  and enterprise vars evars 
these resellers typically have expertise in network design and implementation  which is important when deploying end to end networking infrastructure solutions in larger enterprises 
in addition to specialized technical expertise  sis  sps and evars typically offer sophisticated services capabilities that are frequently desired by larger enterprise customers 
in order to expand our distribution channel to include resellers with such capabilities  we must be able to provide effective support to these resellers 
if our sales  marketing or services capabilities are not sufficiently robust to provide effective support to such sis  sps  and evars  we may not be successful in expanding our distribution model and current si  sp  and evar partners may terminate their relationships with us  which would adversely impact our sales and overall results of operations 
our competition with huawei in the enterprise networking market could have a material adverse effect on our sales and our results of operations 
as huawei expands its international operations  there will be increasing instances where we compete directly with huawei in the enterprise networking market 
we expect to be able to compete effectively with huawei in this market as a result of our strengths in a number of areas including our brand identity  breadth of products and solutions offerings  and professional services capabilities 
we also are free to engineer derivative models of products sourced from h c that would not be available to huawei or other h c customers 
however  as a co owner and oem customer of h c  huawei will have access to many of h c s products just as we do  thereby enhancing huawei s current ability to compete directly with us in markets outside of china  japan  and hong kong 
if this occurs  we could lose a competitive advantage in those markets  which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and overall results of operations 
we may be unable to manage our supply chain successfully  which would adversely impact our sales  gross margin  and profitability 
current business conditions and operational challenges in managing our supply chain affect our business in a number of ways in the past  some key components have had limited availability  there are a smaller number of suppliers and we have narrowed our supplier base  including  in some cases  the sole sourcing of specific components from a single supplier  as integration of networking features on a reduced number of computer chips continues  we are increasingly facing competition from parties who are our suppliers  our ability to accurately forecast demand is diminished  especially in light of general economic weakness and uncertainty following wars and terrorist events  our reliance on  and long term arrangements with  third party manufacturers places much of the supply chain process out of our direct control and heightens the need for accurate forecasting and reduces our ability to transition quickly to alternative supply chain strategies  and we may experience disruptions to our logistics 
some of our suppliers are also our competitors 
we cannot be certain that in the future our suppliers  particularly those who are also in active competition with us  will be able or willing to meet our demand for components in a timely and cost effective manner 
there has been a trend toward consolidation of vendors of electronic components 
our reliance on a smaller number of vendors and the inability to quickly switch vendors increase the risk of logistics disruptions  unfavorable price fluctuations  or disruptions in supply  particularly in a supply constrained environment 
more recently  supplies of certain key components  such as memory  have become tighter as industry demand for such components has increased 
also  the prices of some components have increased as the underlying prices of raw materials needed to manufacture such components have increased 
this is putting upward pressure on our costs as well as increasing the time necessary to obtain these components 
if this persists  we may experience an adverse impact to gross margin as costs either increase or do not decline as fast as they had in the past 
operation of the supply chain requires accurate forecasting of demand 
if overall demand for our products or the mix of demand for our products is significantly different from our expectations  we may face inadequate or excess component supply or inadequate or excess manufacturing capacity 
this would result in orders for products that could not be manufactured in a timely manner  or a buildup of inventory that could not easily be sold 
either of these situations could adversely affect our market share  sales  results of operations or financial position 
our strategies to outsource all of our manufacturing requirements to contract manufacturers may not result in meeting our cost  quality or performance standards 
the inability of any contract manufacturer to meet our cost  quality or performance standards could adversely affect our sales and overall results from operations 
the cost  quality  performance  and availability of contract manufacturing operations are and will be essential to the successful production and sale of many of our products 
the inability of any contract manufacturer to meet our cost  quality  performance  and availability standards could adversely impact our sales and overall results of operations 
we may not be able to provide contract manufacturers with product volumes that are high enough to achieve sufficient cost savings 
if shipments fall below forecasted levels  we may incur increased costs or be required to take ownership of inventory 
in addition  a significant component of maintaining cost competitiveness is the ability of our contract manufacturers to adjust their own costs and manufacturing infrastructure to compensate for possible adverse exchange rate movements 
to the extent that the contract manufacturers are unable to do so  and we are unable to procure alternative product supplies  then our own competitiveness and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
also  our ability to control the quality of products produced by contract manufacturers may be limited and quality issues may not be resolved in a timely manner  which could adversely impact our sales and overall results of operations 
we have implemented a program with our manufacturing partners to ship products directly from regional shipping centers to customers 
through this program  we are relying on these partners to fill customer orders in a timely manner 
this program may not yield the efficiencies that we expect  which would negatively impact our results of operations 
any disruptions to on time delivery to customers would adversely impact our sales and overall results of operations 
adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results 
we are subject to the periodic examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
many of the contingencies faced by us relate to periods when we were substantially larger 
the outcome of these examinations cannot be predicted with certainty and  should unfavorable rulings be made  assessments against us could be significant  and could result in substantial payments by us to the tax authorities 
we may need to engage in complex and costly litigation in order to protect  maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights 
in addition to disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of other parties rights  we may become involved in disputes relating to our assertion of our intellectual property rights 
whether we are defending the assertion of intellectual property rights against us  or asserting our intellectual property rights against others  intellectual property litigation can be complex  costly  protracted  and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
further  plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief and the measures of damages in intellectual property litigation are complex and often subjective or uncertain 
thus  the existence of this type of litigation  or any adverse determinations related to such litigation  could subject us to significant liabilities and costs 
if any of our oem  odm  or joint venture partners become involved in intellectual property disputes and are unable to hold us harmless  then we may incur liabilities or suffer disruption of our business 
any one of these factors could adversely affect our sales  gross margin  overall results of operations  cash flow or financial position 
we may not be able to defend ourselves successfully against claims that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
many of our competitors  such as telecommunications  networking  and computer equipment manufacturers  have large intellectual property portfolios  including patents that may cover technologies that are relevant to our business 
in addition  many smaller companies  universities  and individual inventors have obtained or applied for patents in areas of technology that may relate to our business 
the industry continues to be aggressive in assertion  licensing  and litigation of patents and other intellectual property rights 
in the course of our business  we receive claims of infringement or otherwise become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties 
we evaluate the validity and applicability of these intellectual property rights  and determine in each case whether we must negotiate licenses or cross licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies  protocols  or specifications in our products 
if we are unable to obtain and maintain licenses on favorable terms for intellectual property rights required for the manufacture  sale  and use of our products  particularly those that must comply with industry standard protocols and specifications to be commercially viable  our financial position or results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we are alleged to infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we could be required to seek licenses from others or be prevented from manufacturing or selling our products  which could cause disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete 
fluctuations in our operating results and other factors may contribute to volatility in the market price of our stock 
historically  our stock price has experienced volatility 
we expect that our stock price may continue to experience volatility in the future due to a variety of potential factors such as fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and cash flow  changes in our cash and equivalents and short term investment balances  variations between our actual financial results and published analysts expectations  and announcements by our competitors 
in addition  over the past several years  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the stock prices of many technology companies 
these factors  as well as general economic and political conditions or investors concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial statements and the accounting profession  may have a material adverse affect on the market price of our stock in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity security price risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
our short term investments consist mainly of fixed income securities with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by ten percent from levels as of may   the fair value of our short term investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
we currently have the ability and intention to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
if necessary  we may sell short term investments prior to maturity to implement management strategies and meet our liquidity needs 
we had no long term debt as of may  or we do not hedge any interest rate exposures 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures 
the intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures 
we attempt to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on corporate financial results by hedging existing foreign currency exposures and anticipated foreign currency transactions expected to occur within one month 
anticipated foreign currency transaction exposures with a maturity profile in excess of one month may be selectively hedged 
translation exposures are not hedged 
gains and losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposure 
a hypothetical ten percent appreciation of the us dollar from may  market rates would increase the unrealized value of our forward contracts by million 
conversely  a hypothetical ten percent depreciation of the us dollar from may  market rates would decrease the unrealized value of our forward contracts by million 
the gains or losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions and consequently a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows 
equity security price risk 
we hold publicly traded equity securities that are subject to market price volatility 
equity security price fluctuations of plus or minus percent would not have had a material impact on our financial statements as of may
