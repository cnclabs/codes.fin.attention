overview founded in  intervideo is a provider of dvd software  video editing and dvd burning software  television viewing and recording software and instanton software 
we have developed a technology platform from which we have created a broad suite of integrated multimedia software products 
these products span the digital video cycle by allowing users to capture  edit  author  distribute  burn and play digital video 
we sell our products to pc oems  ce manufacturers and pc peripherals manufacturers worldwide 
we have operations in the united states  taiwan  japan and china 
we derive revenue primarily from the sale of software licenses to oems  which install our software onto pcs prior to delivery to customers 
in addition  we derive revenue from the license of our software to ce manufacturers and manufacturers of pc peripherals that incorporate our software into their own products for distribution 
we also sell our software through retail channels and directly to end users through our websites 
historically  sales of our windvd product  a software dvd player for pcs  to pc oems have accounted for a majority of our revenue 
we derived of our revenue for the year ended december  from sales of our windvd product  primarily to pc oems  as compared to and of our revenue in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
we expect that revenue from sales of our windvd product to pc oems will continue to account for a majority of our revenue 
however  in the future  we expect to derive an increasing percentage of our revenue from sales of other products  including windvd creator  instanton  intervideo home theater  intervideo dvd copy and linux based versions of our dvd and dvr software designed for linux based pcs and ce devices  and products sold through our retail and web based sales channels 
our software is generally bundled with products sold by pc oems 
our pc oem customers include  among others  dell  fujitsu  fujitsu siemens  hewlett packard  ibm  nec and toshiba 
due to a concentration in the pc oem industry  we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a small number of customers 
for the year ended december   our two largest customers accounted for of our revenue  with hewlett packard 
table of contents intervideo  inc 
accounting for of our revenue and toshiba accounting for of our revenue 
we expect that the revenue from dell  which accounted for and of our revenue during the twelve months ended december  and december   respectively  may decrease to in future periods because we understand that our current portion of their business is moving to one of our competitors 
we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a majority of our revenue and gross profit for the foreseeable future  although the identity of those customers may change from period to period 
because there is only a limited number of potential new  large pc oem customers for our windvd product  we must derive any future revenue growth principally from increased unit sales of windvd or other products to existing pc oems  ce manufacturers  pc peripherals manufacturers  smaller pc oems and to consumers through retail channels and our websites 
because some of these other revenue opportunities are more fragmented than the pc oem market and will require more time and effort to penetrate  our revenue may decline or grow at a slower rate than in prior periods 
historically  prices for our products have declined because of competition from other software providers  competition in the pc industry and diminishing margins experienced by pc oems as a result of decreased selling prices and periodic declines in unit sales 
accordingly  we have reduced the prices we charge pc oems for our windvd  windvd creator and other products  and expect such price reductions will continue in the future 
as a matter of policy  we evaluate such price reductions on a continual basis and  in certain circumstances  may determine it would not be in the best interests of the company to reduce prices below a certain level 
we may decide not to lower our product prices  even if a loss of revenue would result 
as a result of declining prices  it may be more difficult for us to increase or maintain our revenue levels and price declines may cause a decline in our gross profits even if our windvd and other product unit sales increase 
we have an internet commerce sales initiative that allows users to purchase products from our websites 
we also continue to expand our retail channels 
for the year ended december   we derived of our revenue from web and retail sales as compared to of revenue for the prior year 
to increase our web and retail sales in the future  we intend to increase investments in associated selling and marketing programs 
the gross profits associated with our products sold through our websites are generally higher than those associated with our oem sales 
accordingly  fluctuations in our web and retail revenue as a percentage of total revenue will impact our gross profits 
we derive and expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside of the united states 
sales outside of the united states accounted for of our revenue for the year ended december   as compared to for the prior year 
currently  most of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
therefore  a strengthening dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our current distribution agreements shift foreign exchange risk to our foreign distributors 
in the future  an increasing portion of our international revenue may be denominated in foreign currencies and we may use derivative instruments to hedge foreign exchange risk 
our financial condition and results of operations are likely to be affected by seasonality in the future 
historically  pc oems have experienced their highest volume of sales during the year end holiday season 
because we generally recognize revenue associated with the sale of our products to our oems customers in the month or quarter following the sales of our products to these oems customers  we expect this seasonality to have a positive effect on our revenue and operating income in the first quarter of each calendar year and a negative effect on our revenue and operating income in the second quarter of that year 
tender offer for ulead systems  inc during the year ended december  and continuing through the first quarter of we purchased shares of stock in ulead systems  inc ulead  a publicly traded company in taiwan that is a leading developer of innovative video  imaging and dvd authoring software  accumulating a total shareholding 
table of contents intervideo  inc 
percentage at percent as of march  on march   we and our wholly owned subsidiary  intervideo digital technology corp 
announced the commencement of a tender offer to purchase an additional to percent of the issued shares of ulead at ntd us per share of ulead common stock 
our obligation to purchase the shares is subject to certain closing conditions  including the requirement that there have not been any material adverse change in the financial condition or business of ulead 
the tender offer is scheduled to expire on april  upon the successful completion of the tender offer  the transaction will be valued at between us and us million  and we will own between and percent of the outstanding shares of ulead 
these figures include the percent of ulead s outstanding shares currently owned by us  the shares to be purchased in the tender offer and an additional of ulead s shares to be purchased outside of the tender offer 
upon the successful completion of the tender offer  we will commence reporting our financial results and those of ulead on a consolidated basis 
for its fiscal year  ulead reported revenue of ntd  us million  operating income of ntd  us million and a net loss of ntd  us million 
ulead does not provide public guidance with respect to its anticipated financial results 
however  we anticipate that our financial consolidation with ulead will increase substantially the consolidated company s revenue  cost of revenue and operating expenses 
the quantitative impact on our financial results cannot be determined at this time due to the uncertainties inherent in the two companies future financial results  uncertainties regarding the amount of synergies and efficiencies that would be garnered as a result of the consolidation and uncertainties regarding the reconciliation of ulead s financial results from taiwan gaap to us gaap  among other factors 
nonetheless  we believe that the consolidation will be accretive to our net income for the current fiscal year 
there can be no assurance  however  that the transaction will be accretive  that any synergies will be achieved  that the transaction will be consummated at all or that other negative factors will not arise from the attempted or completed tender offer 
please see risk factors we may not be successful in addressing problems encountered in connection with our proposed transaction with ulead or any other acquisitions we may undertake  which could disrupt our operations or otherwise harm our business 
critical accounting estimates we base the discussions and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations upon our consolidated financial statements  which we prepare in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing these financial statements  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experiences and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments  and therefore are critical to understanding the results of our operations are revenue recognition  accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition our revenue is primarily derived from fees received under software licenses granted to pc oems  ce manufacturers  pc peripherals manufacturers  retail distributors  retail customers and directly to end users or businesses 
we record revenue generated from these sales in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  under which revenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  
table of contents intervideo  inc 
delivery of the software has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
typically  under the terms of our license agreements with our oem customers  they are entitled only to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis  prior to sale into the oem s sales channel partners or sell through to the oem s end customers 
under the terms of our revenue recognition policy  we recognize revenue based on evidence of products sold by the oems to end customers or to the oem s sales channel partners 
we do not typically provide upgrades or post contract support pcs to the oems customers or sales channel partners 
accordingly  under such agreements we do not defer any revenue  as we no longer have an obligation once an oem s products have been shipped from the oem to the oem s sales channel partners or to an oem s end customer 
under certain other agreements  we defer the recognition of oem revenue due to ongoing obligations in association with upgrade rights to end users or significant pcs provided to the oems customers 
depending on the specific contractual obligation  we recognize this revenue over a period of the shorter of the contractual obligation period or the estimated life of the product 
in general  we consider the estimated life of our products to be three years 
typically  our oem customers do not have the right to claim a credit or refund for returns from the oem s sales channel partners or end customers back to the oem 
however  in the few instances where we have granted our oem customers with the right to claim a refund or credit for these types of returns  we defer of the revenue until we are able to establish a returns reserve based on historical returns activity that is specific to the respective sales channel  product line or country 
we have determined that the return percentage for the windvd product line for our oem sales channel for sales made in the united states has been less than of sales 
as a result  we have not deferred windvd sales to oem customers in the united states that have been granted a right of return 
if in the future  the actual or estimated number of returned units materially increases as a percentage of sales  we may be required to establish a returns reserve for these sales 
under the terms of the oem license agreements  each oem qualifies our software on their hardware and software configurations 
once our software has been qualified  the oem begins shipping products and reports net sales to us  at which point we record revenue 
most oems pay a license fee based on the number of copies of licensed software included in the products sold to their customers 
these oems pay fees on a per unit basis  and we record associated revenue when we receive notification of the oems sales of the licensed software to an end customer or sales channel partner 
the terms of the license agreements generally require the oems to notify us of sales of our products within to days after the end of the month or quarter in which the sales occur 
as a result  we generally recognize revenue in the month or quarter following the sales of the software to these oems customers 
a small number of oems that sell pc components  place orders with us for a fixed quantity of units at a fixed price based on an agreed upon purchase order or contract 
in such cases  qualification of our software is not required  and these oems have no rights to upgrades or returns 
we generally recognize revenue upon the completion of shipment  in accordance with the terms of the respective agreement  to these oems 
in addition to the per unit license fees discussed above  certain oem agreements also include prepaid license fees and or non recurring engineering nre service fees primarily for porting our software to the oem s hardware and software configurations 
since we provide when and if available upgrade rights to our oem customers on the products they have licensed from the point in time when they receive the product until the point in time when they have sold the product to their sales channel partners or end customers  any prepaid license fees are recognized based on actual shipments after the upgrade rights have lapsed 
the nre service fees are recognized upon completion and acceptance of the nre service 
some oem agreements provide the oem 
table of contents intervideo  inc 
with rights to pcs to be provided by us to the oem s end customers 
this pcs may or may not include the right to unspecified future software upgrades 
however  pcs is typically not available to the oems end users 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for pcs for end customer support on a limited number of products sold to oems in japan 
on these arrangements  we use the residual method to account for the allocation between the license revenue and the service revenue 
the allocated license revenue is recognized in full upon the oem s sale of the licensed product to the oem s sales channel partners and  where the only undelivered element of the agreement is pcs  the allocated pcs is recognized over the period of the pcs obligation 
in all other agreements where we have sold pcs in which we have not been able to establish a vsoe of fair value for pcs or where there are additional undelivered elements  such as nre service fees  we defer all of the revenue until the additional undelivered elements are accepted and the only undelivered element is pcs 
once the only undelivered element is pcs  we recognize the entire arrangement fee over the pcs period 
end user sales are made directly through our websites 
we do not offer specified upgrade rights to any class of customer  and there are no unspecified upgrade rights associated with end user sales 
we recognize revenue from sales through our websites upon delivery of product and the receipt of payment by means of an authorized credit card 
end users who purchase our software from our websites have limited rights of return for products they have purchased in the previous days  which we currently reserve for using a day sales return reserve based upon historical return percentages 
we sell our products to retailers and distributors either on a consignment or non consignment basis 
for consignment product shipments  in general  the distributor will not take ownership of the product at the point in time when we ship product to the distributor 
once the distributor sells the consignment based product to a retailer or an end customer and ownership is transferred from us to the retailer or end customer  the distributor will report those sales to us and we invoice the distributor 
for non consignment product shipments  the distributor will take ownership of the product at the point in time when we ship the product to the distributor and we invoice the distributor upon such shipment 
since we do not have contractually obligated minimum orders or payment terms with our distributors  we do not recognize revenue for retail product distribution prior to invoicing 
certain distributors and retailers  primarily in japan  have limited rights to return products that were purchased in the previous six months 
these distributors have no rights to product upgrades 
we generally recognize revenue  net of contractually obligated return rights and any additional required rebate or pricing reserves  upon completion of shipment to these distributors and retailers 
other distributors and retailers  primarily in the united states and europe  have unlimited rights of return 
we generally recognize revenue upon receipt of evidence that the distributors and retailers have sold our products through to end users  less any required rebate or pricing reserves 
we have begun selling licenses of our products to corporations and other businesses in the united states 
this corporate licensing program is generally conducted either directly between intervideo and the licensee or through a reseller 
for these sales we do not provide the corporation a right to return the product once it has been delivered and we do not provide support or upgrade rights to that licensee 
we currently recognize revenue for these sales upon confirmation of delivery of the product 
certain customer agreements call for the payment by us of marketing development funds  co operative advertising fees  rebates or similar charges 
we account for such fees in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
as a reduction in revenue unless there is an identifiable benefit and the fair value of the charges can be reasonably estimated in which case we record these transactions as marketing expense 
commissions paid to third party sales representatives are included in sales and marketing expenses 
accounting for income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
we establish a valuation allowance if we determine that it is more likely 
table of contents intervideo  inc 
than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in the valuation allowance are included in our consolidated statements of income as provision for income taxes 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefits from our deferred tax assets 
if actual circumstances differ from our expectations  we may be required to adjust our estimates in future periods and our financial position  cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected

cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of license royalties  expenses incurred to manufacture  package and distribute our software products  the amortization of developed technology  costs associated with end user pcs and the cost of settlement of intellectual property matters 
license royalties consist of royalties paid or accrued for payment to third parties for technologies incorporated into our products 
in general  the amount of royalties depends on the number of our product units sold and the royalty rates associated with the third party technology incorporated into those products 
we sometimes prepay for the right to bundle and distribute certain licensed technologies 
in general  these prepayments are at a flat rate and are not determined by the number of units of the bundled product that are shipped 
in general  the license rights are granted for one year and the estimated useful life of the technology is three years 
end user pcs costs include the costs associated with providing assistance to end users of our products 
with the exception of packaging and distribution costs  the cost of revenue is generally the same for each product  regardless of sales channel 
certain product costs associated with sales to distributors  retailers and end users are deferred until the corresponding revenue has been recognized 
cost of settlement of intellectual property matters consists of amounts that we have agreed to pay to third parties in settlement of alleged infringement of certain patented technology used in our customers products and accruals for royalties related to our usage of technologies under patent where no agreement exists 

table of contents intervideo  inc 
gross profit gross profit is affected by competitive price pressures  fluctuations in unit volumes  changes in royalty amounts and changes in the mix of products sold and in our mix of distribution channels 
differences in gross profits by sales channel are primarily a reflection of product pricing differences  which can be impacted by distribution and marketing rebates  associated with each sales channel 
in addition  our gross profit may be affected by costs associated with the settlement of intellectual property matters 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs  consulting expenses associated with the development of new products  technology license fees  professional fees and product evaluation and testing costs

cost of revenue year ended december  change to year ended december  cost of revenue in thousands percentage of total revenue cost of revenue increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased unit sales and an increase in the per unit cost of licensed royalties paid to dolby laboratories 
royalties paid to dolby laboratories increased m  or  in the year ended december  over the year ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a credit of million taken during the year ended december  representing the reversal of a previous accrual for unlicensed royalties no longer deemed probable 
cost of revenue in absolute dollars will continue to be impacted by per unit costs of royalties 
we expect that cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will be impacted by the introduction of our newer  higher margin products offset by continued price erosion in our windvd sales to our oem customers 
gross profit year ended december  change to year ended december  gross profit in thousands percentage of total revenue gross profits were of revenue for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a credit of million taken during the year ended december  representing the reversal of a previous accrual for unlicensed royalties no longer deemed probable 
gross profits were also impacted by lower average selling prices of our windvd  windvd creator and other products to our major oem customers without a proportional decrease in third party royalties and an increase in per unit pricing of third party royalties paid to dolby laboratories 
these factors were offset by shifts in our sales mix volumes to higher margin products such as windvd creator 
we expect that gross profits will be impacted by the introduction of our newer  higher margin products offset by continued price erosion in our windvd sales to our oem customers and higher per unit costs 
research and development expenses year ended december  change to year ended december  research and development expenses in thousands percentage of total revenue research and development expenses were million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  and million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the increase in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to a million increase in payroll and payroll related expenses due to increased research and development headcount at our international locations  a  increase in depreciation expense due to increased capital expenditures  a  increase in legal and outside consulting fees  a  increase in travel and entertainment expenses and a  increase in facilities charges and other general operating expenses 
research and development headcount grew to during the year ended december   an increase of as compared to at december  this growth required us to increase our facilities in taiwan and china 
we believe that a significant level of research and development expenses will be 
table of contents intervideo  inc

sales and marketing expenses year ended december  change to year ended december  sales and marketing expenses in thousands percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expenses increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the increase in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to a  increase in payroll and payroll related expenses due to increased sales and marketing headcount  a  increase in outside consulting fees and commissions to outside sales representatives  a  increase in travel  promotional and tradeshow expenses and a  increase in depreciation and facilities related expenses 
the decrease  as a percentage of revenue  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year was primarily due to the overall increase in revenue without a proportional increase in sales and marketing expenses 
we intend to actively market  sell and promote our products and take actions to further develop our brand name and retail presence 
therefore  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars and that such expenses may increase as a percentage of revenue in the future as we seek to further establish our retail presence

additionally  during the year ended december   we incurred  in legal and administrative expenses associated with the pursuit of strategic transactions 
we expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue but to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we build our infrastructure to support our anticipated growth and operations as a public company

general and administrative expenses year ended december  change to year ended december  general and administrative expenses in thousands percentage of total revenue general and administrative expenses increased to million or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  this increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in directors and officers liability insurance premiums of  an increase in payroll and payroll related expenses of  and an increase in local taxes of

other income  net year ended december  change to year ended december  other income  net in thousands percentage of total revenue other income  net increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the interest earned on the additional cash generated from our initial public offering in july provision benefit for income taxes year ended december  change to year ended december  provision benefit for income taxes in thousands percentage of total revenue percentage not meaningful we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december  as compared to an income tax benefit of million for year ended december  the income tax benefit for the year ended december  was the result of the release of a significant portion of our valuation allowance 
such release of valuation allowance was due to our reassessment of the realizability of certain of our deferred tax assets as being more likely than not 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was

the non cash adjustment for tax benefits derived from stock option activity results primarily from disqualified disposition of incentive stock option and non qualified stock option exercises 
the non cash adjustment for stock based compensation expense reflects the amortization of deferred stock based compensation resulting for the granting of stock options with exercise prices less than the deemed fair market value of the underlying common stock 
beginning in the third quarter of  when we are required to adopt the aforementioned sfas no 
r  we expect our stock based compensation expense will increase but the actual impact of adopting sfas no 
r cannot be accurately estimated at this time  as it will depend on the market value and the amount of share based awards granted in future periods 
the net increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and taxes payable is primarily due to increases in accrued license royalties of million as a result of increased unit shipments as well as an increase in the per unit cost of these royalties  increases in accrued payroll and bonuses of million due to increased headcount and increases in accruals for outside consulting and external audit fees of  largely due to sarbanes oxley efforts offset by a million decrease in taxes payable due to the lower effective tax rate 
the increase in deferred revenue is primarily due to growth in retail sales in north america and europe for which revenue with certain customers has been deferred until evidence of sell through to the end user is obtained 
these increases were partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred revenue as a result of changes in certain contractual arrangements 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million  primarily comprised of million of net income adjusted for non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of  stock based compensation of  loss on disposal of property and equipment of  and other non cash charges and credits and increases in accounts payable of  and deferred revenue  accrued liabilities and taxes payable of million  offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and prepaid expenses and other current assets of million 
the non cash adjustment for stock based compensation expense reflects the amortization of deferred stock based compensation resulting for the granting of options with exercise prices less than the deemed fair market value of the underlying common stock 
the loss on disposal of property is largely a result of the relocation of our corporate headquarters and the resultant write off of assets not fully depreciated at the time of the move 
the increase in deferred revenue is partially due to growth in retail sales in north america and europe for which revenue with certain customers has been deferred until evidence of sell through to the end user is obtained 
additionally  the deferral of revenue associated with implied future obligations on certain contracts with our oem customers contributed to the increase in deferred revenue during the period 
included in the change in accrued liabilities is the reversal of an unlicensed royalty accrual of million as a result of the determination that the potential liability related to a previously established accrual is no longer deemed probable as well as payments of million on intellectual property claim settlements during the year 
these amounts were offset by an increase in accrued license fees due to increased unit shipments of our products 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  which included the purchase of property and equipment of million including the implementation of our new erp system and expanded operations in asia and net purchases of short term investments of million 
additionally  we invested million in two private companies in taiwan and invested million for the acquisition of shares of common stock of ulead systems  inc ulead  a publicly traded company in taiwan

net cash provided by financing activities in was million  consisting of net proceeds from our initial public offering in july of million and  due to the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
we currently have no significant commitments for capital expenditures but we expect to spend approximately million to million on capital expenditures in  which will include the world wide roll out of our erp system 
we anticipate that we will increase our capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in personnel and infrastructure  including facilities and systems 
as of december  we had future lease commitments for buildings of a total of million under non cancelable operating leases through we have no debt obligations 
on march   we announced the commencement of a tender offer to purchase an additional to percent of the issued shares of ulead at ntd us per share of ulead common stock 
our obligation to purchase the shares is subject to certain closing conditions  including the requirement that there have not been any material adverse change in the financial condition or business of ulead prior to the expiration of the tender offer on april  upon the successful completion of the tender offer  the transaction will be valued at between us and us million  and we will own between and percent of the outstanding shares of ulead 
these figures include the percent of ulead s outstanding shares currently owned by us  the shares to be purchased in the tender offer and an additional of ulead s shares to be purchased outside of the tender offer 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalent and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our current working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the successful completion of the tender offer would utilize between and million of our working capital 
furthermore  potential investment in ulead is likely to increase our capital requirements in although the amount of such increase is not currently known 
to the extent our existing sources of cash and cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our activities  we will need to raise additional funds 
if we issue additional stock to raise capital  your percentage ownership in us will be reduced 
if we raise funds through debt financing  we will have to pay interest and may be subject to restrictive covenants  which could limit our ability to take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes 
additional financing may not be available when needed and  even if such financing is available  it may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
we do not anticipate a need for raising funds by equity or debt financing in the year disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments we lease certain of our facilities under non cancelable operating leases  which expire at various dates through some of these facility lease agreements generally provide base rental rates which increase at various times during the terms of the leases and also provide for renewal options at fair market rental value 
we are also responsible for common area maintenance charges on certain office leases  which are generally less than of base rents and  as such are not included in the information presented below 
total operating lease expense  including month to month rentals  was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we generally make purchases under cancelable purchase orders and do not enter into long term supply agreements

as of december   future minimum commitments under operating leases are as follows in thousands and we do not have further material contractual obligations in the year ending december  thereafter we have no contractual obligations or commercial commitments that are not already accrued for in our financial statements 
risk factors we are subject to a number of risks 
some of these risks are endemic to the dvd software industry 
the fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen the significance of these risks 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of  or that we may currently deem immaterial  may become important factors that harm our business 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business could be harmed 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
you should carefully consider each of the risk factors and the other information in this annual report on form k 
the rapidly evolving nature of our industry makes it difficult to forecast our future results 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid changes in technology 
demand for our products depends on our ability to maintain competitive pricing and to provide new or improved products that keep up with changes in technology 
any evaluation of our business and prospects must be made in light of the risks and difficulties encountered by companies offering products or services in new and rapidly evolving markets 
the market for software based digital video and audio solutions for incorporation in products in the pc and consumer electronics industries is rapidly evolving  and it is difficult to forecast the future growth rate  if any  or size of the market for our products 
we may not accurately forecast customer behavior and recognize or respond to emerging trends  changing preferences or competitive factors facing us  and  therefore  we may fail to make accurate financial forecasts 
our current and future expense levels are based largely on our investment plans and estimates of future revenue and are  to a large extent  fixed 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  which would harm our operating results 
we expect our operating results to fluctuate on an annual and quarterly basis  which may result in volatility of our stock price 
we expect our operating results to fluctuate on an annual and quarterly basis  which may cause our stock price to be volatile 
important factors  many of which are outside our control  that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include fluctuations in demand for  and sales of  our products and the pcs and ce devices with which our products are bundled  timely and accurate reporting to us by our oem customers of units shipped  which determines the timing and level of revenue received from these customers  
table of contents intervideo  inc 
changes in the timing of orders or the completion of customer contracts with significant oem customers  competitive factors  including introductions of new products  product enhancements and the introduction of new technologies by our competitors and the entry of new competitors into the digital video and audio software markets  which may result in our loss of business  decisions to acquire other companies  including the announcement of our tender offer for ulead  increases in third party license fees  such as the increase in royalties paid to dolby  changes in consumer demand for our products due to the marketing of alternative technologies by our oem customers  declines in selling prices of our products to our oem customers or other customers  market acceptance of new products developed by us  such as our instanton product  changes in the relative portion of our revenue represented by our various products and customers including the mix of oem  retail and web sales  timing of revenue recognition  including deferrals of revenue  the mix of international and domestic revenue  the costs of litigation and intellectual property claims  including the settlement of claims based upon our violation or alleged violation of others intellectual property rights  economic conditions specific to the pc  consumer electronics and related industries  changes in accounting regulations that will require us to expense stock options 
due to these and other factors  period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful  and you should not rely on our results for any one period as an indication of our future performance 
in addition  our future operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in this event  our stock price could decline significantly 
changes in our product and service offerings could cause us to defer the recognition of revenue  which could harm our operating results and adversely impact our ability to forecast revenue 
we have created  and intend to continue to create  new software and software bundles such as windvd creator  intervideo home theater  intervideo dvd copy and instanton 
these products contain advanced features and functionality that have required and may continue to require us to provide an increased level of end user support 
in the future  as these new products become more complex  we may also be obligated to provide additional support to our oem customers to bundle our software with their products 
these potential increases in oem and end user support obligations could require us to defer both license and pcs revenues to future periods  which could harm our operating results and adversely impact our ability to accurately forecast revenue 
we expect our product prices to continue to decline  which could harm our operating results 
we expect prices for our products to continue to decline over the next few years 
because of competition from other software providers  competition in the pc industry and diminishing margins experienced by pc oems as a result of decreased selling prices and lower unit sales  we have reduced the prices we charge pc oems for our windvd  windvd creater and other products 
we expect this trend to continue  which will make it more difficult to increase or maintain our revenue and may cause a decline in our gross profits  even if unit sales of any particular product increase 
if unit sale increases do not offset anticipated price declines  our 
table of contents intervideo  inc 
revenue will decline 
accordingly  our future success will depend in part on our ability to increase sales of our higher margin products and to introduce and sell new products and upgrades to our existing products  which could increase our revenue and could improve our profit margins 
we may not sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we did not achieve profitability until our fiscal year ended december  as of december   we had retained earnings of million 
we expect to incur significant operating expenses over the next several years in connection with the continued development and expansion of our business 
our expenses include research and development and marketing expenses relating to products that will not be introduced and will not generate revenue until later periods  if at all 
we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
we may not be successful in addressing problems encountered in connection with our proposed transaction with ulead or any other acquisitions we may undertake  which could disrupt our operations or otherwise harm our business 
on march   we announced the commencement of a tender offer to purchase a controlling percentage of the issued shares of ulead 
the tender offer is scheduled to expire on april  we have limited experience in acquiring businesses and technologies  including businesses with international operations 
the proposed transaction with ulead will be our largest acquisition to date 
the transaction with ulead and any other proposed or completed acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks  including risks that the tender offer might not be consummated if less than percent of the issued shares of ulead are rendered  unanticipated developments or events concerning the financial condition  assets  liabilities  operations  business or prospects of ulead might arise after the completion of the tender offer because we only conducted limited due diligence on ulead based on publicly available information  unanticipated costs associated with the transaction including issues associated with complicated cross border transactions  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  diversion of management s attention from our core business including international travel to taiwan  customers acceptance of new technology or product offerings  problems maintaining internal controls and procedures and other uniform standards or policies with a company that was not subject to us generally accepted accounting principles or disclosure requirements prior to the consummation of the transaction and that has operations outside of the united states  problems integrating the operations  personnel  technologies or products of the companies  conflicts of interest issues that might arise between intervideo and ulead as a majority owned subsidiary  and potential loss of key management  engineers and other employees 
we expect to continue to review opportunities to buy or make investments in other businesses  products or technologies that would enhance our technical capabilities  complement our current products or expand the breadth of our markets or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
the successful completion of our tender offer for ulead would utilize between and million of our working capital 
any other acquisitions of 
table of contents intervideo  inc 
businesses or technologies will require significant commitment of resources beyond the substantial portion of our cash committed for the tender offer 
we may be required to pay for any acquisitions with cash  but we cannot be certain that additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
in lieu of paying cash  we could issue stock as consideration for an acquisition that would dilute existing stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt or assume contingent liabilities 
we license technology from third parties for use in our windvd and other standards based products  and we might not be able to ship our products in their present forms if we fail to maintain these license arrangements 
we license technology for use in our windvd  windvd creator and intervideo home theater products and other existing and planned products from third parties under agreements  some of which have a limited duration 
for example  we have a license agreement with dolby laboratories for its audio technology and logo  a license agreement with the dvd copy control association  inc for the content scrambling system designed to prevent the copying of dvds  a license with mpeg la for its mpeg video technology  a license from thomson licensing sa for its mp audio technology and various other license agreements relating to patents  know how and trademarks that are important to various aspects of the development  marketing and sale of our products 
we are obligated to pay royalties under each of the dolby  dvd copy control association  mpeg la and thomson licensing sa agreements  and dolby  dvd copy control association  mpeg la and thomson licensing may each terminate its license if we breach any material provision of the license or if other events occur  as specified in the license agreement 
if we fail to maintain these license arrangements  we might not be able to ship our products in their present forms and our revenue could decline 
because there is a small number of large pc oems  we have only a limited number of potential new large oem customers for our windvd product  which will likely cause our revenue to grow at a slower rate than in recent periods 
historically  our revenue growth has been achieved in large part due to sales of our windvd product to new  large pc oem customers 
more recently  we have derived an increasing percentage of our revenue from sales of our non windvd products  which include windvd creator  intervideo home theater  intervideo dvd copy and our instanton product 
because there is only a limited number of potential new  large pc oem customers for our products  we must derive any future revenue growth principally from increased sales of windvd or other products to existing pc oems and pc peripherals manufacturers and from sales to smaller regional pc oems and directly to consumers through retail channels and our websites 
because some of these other revenue opportunities are more fragmented than the pc oem market and will take more time and effort to penetrate  our revenue may grow at a slower rate than historically 
additionally  if the rate of such expansion via retail channels and our website proceeds slower than we anticipate  our financial position could be adversely affected 
we depend substantially on our relationships with a small number of pc oems  and our failure to maintain or expand these relationships would reduce our revenue and gross profit or otherwise harm our business 
the pc industry is highly concentrated  and we have derived a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our products to a small number of pc oems 
for the year ended december   our two largest customers accounted for of our revenue  with hewlett packard accounting for and toshiba accounting for of our revenue during that period 
we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a majority of our revenue  gross profit and accounts receivables for the foreseeable future because of the concentrated nature of our client base 
if our customers dispute the accounts receivables or are otherwise unable to pay the balance  our income from operations could decline 

table of contents intervideo  inc 
if the pc industry continues to consolidate  the number of customers accounting for the majority of our revenue could decrease further 
our agreements with our customers typically do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are of limited duration or are terminable with little or no notice 
the loss of any of these customers  or a material decrease in revenue from these customers  would reduce our gross profit or otherwise harm our business 
if our competitors offer our oem customers more favorable terms than we do or if our competitors are able to take advantage of their existing relationships with these oems  then these oems may not include our software with their pcs 
if we are unable to maintain or expand our relationships with pc oems  our business will suffer 
as a result of our dependency on a small number of large pc oems  any problems those customers experience  or their failure to promote products that contain our software  could harm our operating results 
as a result of our concentrated customer base  problems that our pc oem customers experience could harm our operating results 
some of the factors that affect the business of our pc oem customers  all of which are beyond our control  include the competition these customers face and the market acceptance of their products  the engineering  marketing and management capabilities of these customers and the technical challenges that they face in developing their products  the financial and other resources of these customers  new governmental regulations or changes in taxes or tariffs applicable to these customers  and the failure of third parties to develop and introduce content for dvd and other digital media applications in a timely fashion 
the inability of our pc oem customers to successfully address any of these risks could harm our business 
in addition  we have little or no influence over the degree to which these customers promote products that incorporate our software or the prices at which these products are sold to end users 
if our pc oem customers fail to adequately promote products that incorporate our software  our revenue could decline 
we have material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting that may prevent us from being able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud  which could harm our business and operating results 
effective disclosure and internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and prevent fraud 
in addition  section under the sarbanes oxley act of requires that we assess  and our independent registered public accounting firm attest to  the design and operating effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting 
if we cannot provide reliable and accurate financial reports and prevent fraud  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we have in the past discovered  and may in the future discover  areas of our internal controls that need improvement 
although we  and our independent registered public accounting firm  have not completed all of the procedures and assessments required by section and we will avail ourselves of the day exemptive order to complete such assessment  deficiencies in our internal controls that are considered to be material weaknesses have been identified in the procedures completed to date 
the material weaknesses  as well as our remediation efforts  are more fully discussed in this annual report under item a  controls and procedures 
while we have taken steps to remediate the identified material weaknesses during the first quarter of  we cannot be certain that any remedial measures we take will ensure that we design  implement  and maintain adequate disclosure and internal controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or will be 
table of contents intervideo  inc 
sufficient to address and eliminate the material weaknesses in our first quarter or next year s annual assessment 
remedying the material weaknesses that have been identified  and any additional deficiencies  significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that we or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify in the future  could require us to incur significant costs  expend significant time and management resources or make other changes 
we are currently unable to determine whether any of the material weaknesses identified in this report will be remediated by the end of our first quarter of fiscal  and if they are not  we may be required to report in our quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of fiscal or in subsequent reports filed with the securities and exchange commission that material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting continue to exist 
any delay or failure to design and implement new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation or operation  could harm our operating results  cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations  or prevent us from providing reliable and accurate financial reports or avoiding or detecting fraud 
disclosure of our material weaknesses  any failure to remediate such material weaknesses in a timely fashion or having or maintaining ineffective disclosure and internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital 
we have received notices of claims  and may receive additional notices of claims in the future  regarding the alleged infringement of third parties intellectual property rights that may result in restrictions or prohibitions on the sale of our products and cause us to pay license fees and damages 
some third parties hold patents that such parties claim cover various aspects of dvd technology incorporated into our and our customers products 
our digital video and audio products comply with industry standard dvd specifications 
some third parties have claimed that various aspects of dvd technology incorporated into our and our customers products infringe upon patents held by them  including the following mpeg la 
dvd specifications include technology known as mpeg that governs the process of storing video in digital form 
a group of companies  comprised primarily of ce manufacturers  has formed a consortium known as mpeg la  llc to enforce member companies patents covering certain aspects of mpeg technology 
mpeg la  and certain members of the consortium  have notified us that they believe that our products infringe on patents owned by members of the consortium 
in march  we entered into a license agreement with mpeg la pursuant to which we obtained a license  retroactive to our inception  to mpeg la s patents necessary to the mpeg standard in exchange for a cash payment and our agreement to make ongoing royalty payments 
this license requires that we pay a royalty to mpeg la on our sales to end users and that we notify the oems to whom we sell our products that they are obligated to obtain a license from mpeg la for any use of our products that comply with the mpeg standard 
in addition  mpeg la  and certain members of the consortium  have notified a number of pc oems  including some of our customers  that they believe mpeg la members patents are infringed by those pc oem products that incorporate mpeg technology 
we are aware that a number of pc oems  including some of our customers  have settled the mpeg la claims and entered into license agreements with mpeg la 
dvd c 
another group of companies has formed a consortium known as dvd c to enforce the proprietary rights of holders of patents covering some aspects of dvd technology 
dvd c has notified us that we may need a license so that our products that incorporate dvd technology do not infringe patents owned by members of the consortium 
in addition  dvd c or its members may demand that pc oems or other companies manufacturing or licensing dvd related products  including our customers  pay license fees or stop selling products covered by the patents of the member companies 

table of contents intervideo  inc 
others 
other third parties  including nissim corporation  have notified a number of pc oems  including some of our customers  that they believe their patents are infringed by the products of these pc oems that incorporate certain dvd related technology 
nissim and the other third parties making such claims may demand that these pc oems pay license fees or stop selling products that are covered by the third party s patents 
we and our customers may be subject to additional third party claims that our and our customers products violate the intellectual property rights of those parties 
in addition to the claims described above  we may receive notices of claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
many companies aggressively use their patent portfolios to bring infringement claims against competitors and other parties 
as a result  we may become a party to litigation in the future as a result of an alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of others  including dvd c or nissim 
in addition  we are aware that a consortium of companies  known as c  has been formed for the purpose of asserting the patent rights of its members covering some aspects of dvd technology 
c may demand that pc oems or other companies manufacturing or licensing dvd related products  including us and our customers  pay license fees and damages for the use of the technology  or be prohibited from selling products  covered by the c patents 
similarly  other parties have alleged that aspects of mpeg and other multimedia technologies infringe upon patents held by them 
we may be required to pay license fees and damages or be prohibited from selling our products in the future if it is determined that our products infringe on patents owned by these third parties 
in addition  other companies may form consortia in the future  similar to mpeg la  dvd c and c  to enforce their proprietary rights and these consortia may seek to enforce their patent rights against us and our customers 
some of our products can be used in connection with the copying of video content  which may include content protected by copyright 
though we believe these products do not contribute to copyright infringement and do not defeat encryption in violation of the digital millennium copyright act  some content owners have shown a willingness to instigate litigation against producers of products that could be used to copy copyrighted content 
defending such suits could be costly and could cause a serious disruption in our business regardless of the outcome 
we may be required to pay substantial damages and may be restricted or prohibited from selling our products if it is proven that we violate the intellectual property rights of others 
if dvd c  c  nissim or another third party proves that our technology infringes its patents  we may be required to pay substantial damages for past infringement and may be required to pay license fees or royalties on future sales of our products 
if we are required to pay license fees in the amounts that are currently published by  for example  dvd c for past sales to our large pc oem customers  such fees would exceed the revenue we have received from those pc oem customers 
in addition  if it were proven that we willfully infringed on a third party s patents  we may be held liable for three times the amount of damages we would otherwise have to pay 
in addition  intellectual property litigation may require us to stop selling  incorporating or using our products that use the infringed intellectual property  obtain a license to make  sell or use the relevant technology from the owner of the infringed intellectual property  which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  and redesign our products so as not to use the infringed intellectual property  which may not be technically or commercially feasible and may cause us to expend significant resources 
furthermore  the defense of infringement claims and lawsuits  regardless of their outcome  would likely be expensive to resolve and could require a significant portion of management s time 
in addition  rather than litigating an infringement matter  we may determine that it is in our best interests to settle the matter 
terms of a settlement may include restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to sell products incorporating the other party s 
table of contents intervideo  inc 
technology  the payment of damages and our agreement to license technology in exchange for a license fee and ongoing royalties 
these fees may be substantial 
if we are forced to take any of the actions described above  defend against any claims from third parties or pay any license fees or damages  our business could be harmed 
we may be liable to some of our customers for damages that they incur in connection with intellectual property claims 
our license agreements  including the agreements we have entered into with our large pc oem customers  generally contain warranties of non infringement and commitments to indemnify our customers against liability arising from infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
examples of third party intellectual property rights include the patents held by nissim and by members of mpeg la  dvd c and c 
these commitments may require us to indemnify or pay damages to our customers for all or a portion of any license fees or other damages  including attorneys fees  our customers are required to pay  or agree to pay  these or other third parties 
we have received notices from some of our customers asserting that we are required to indemnify them under our agreements with them  or providing notice that they have received from third parties infringement claims that are related to our products 
these customers include  among others  fujitsu  micron electronics and mpc llc formerly known as micron pc llc  as well as other customers with which we have settled 
we expect to make additional cash payments to settle similar claims in the future 
although mpeg la has stated that some of our pc oem customers  including dell  fujitsu limited  gateway  hewlett packard  sony and toshiba  are currently mpeg la licensees  not all of our pc oem customers are mpeg la licensees 
notwithstanding that we have signed a license agreement with mpeg la  we may continue to be liable to some of our customers for amounts that those customers pay or have paid to mpeg la in settlement of claims of infringement brought by mpeg la against those customers 
even with respect to those pc oem customers that have become licensees  we may have liability to these customers for prior infringement and future royalty payments 
if we are required to pay damages to our customers or indemnify our customers for damages they incur  our business could be harmed 
if our customers are required to pay license fees in the amounts that are currently published by some claimants  and we are required to pay damages to our customers or indemnify our customers for such amounts  such payments would exceed our revenue from these customers 
even if a particular claim falls outside of our indemnity or warranty obligations to our customers  our customers may be entitled to additional contractual remedies against us 
furthermore  even if we are not liable to our customers  our customers may attempt to pass on to us the cost of any license fees or damages owed to third parties by reducing the amounts they pay for our products 
these price reductions could harm our business 
we have derived a majority of our revenue from the sale of our windvd product to pc oems  and these customers may not continue to purchase this product or we may fail to attract new customers for this product 
we derived of our revenue for the year ended december  from sales of our windvd product  primarily to pc oems 
we expect that revenue from sales of our windvd product to pc oems will continue to account for a majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  our business will suffer if our existing pc oem customers do not continue to incorporate our windvd product into the pcs they sell or if we are unable to obtain new pc oem customers for our windvd product 
slow growth  or negative growth  in the pc industry could reduce demand for our products and reduce our gross profit 
our revenue depends in large part on the demand for our products by pc oems 
the pc industry has experienced slow or negative growth in the recent past due to general economic slowdowns  market saturation and other factors 
if slow or negative growth in the pc industry were to recur  demand for our products may decrease 
furthermore  if a reduction in demand for our products occurs  we may not be able to reduce expenses commensurately  due in part to the continuing need for research and development 
accordingly  continued slow growth or negative growth in the pc industry could reduce our gross profit

our success in generating revenue depends on the growth of the use of software solutions in the pc and consumer electronics industries 
our continued success in generating revenue depends on growth in the use of software solutions to add features and functionality to pcs and ce devices 
our software is currently used primarily in pcs  and we expect it to be useful for ce products 
these markets are rapidly evolving  and it is difficult to predict their potential size or future growth rate 
in addition  we are uncertain as to the extent to which software products such as ours will be used in these markets in the future 
their market acceptance may be impacted by the performance  cost and availability of semiconductors that perform similar functions and the level of copy protection that can be attained and maintained in software products 
our success in generating revenue in these markets will depend on increased adoption of software solutions based on the same standards as ours 
if the pc and consumer electronics markets adopt software solutions more slowly than we expect  or if content providers are dissatisfied with the level of copy protection available in software products  our growth would not likely continue  and our business would likely suffer 
our products are based primarily on the microsoft windows operating system  and most of our customers require that the combination of our software products and their pcs be certified by microsoft s windows hardware qualification labs 
accordingly  we are dependent on microsoft  which exposes us to risks  particularly if microsoft chooses to compete with us in the future 
our products are based primarily on the microsoft windows operating system 
if industry and customer preferences in operating systems shift  our products may not be compatible with other operating systems and our business could be harmed 
our revenue is highly dependent upon acceptance of products that are based on the microsoft windows operating system  which is currently the dominant operating system used in the pc industry 
microsoft could make changes to its operating system that could render our products incompatible 
other industry participants could develop operating systems to replace the windows operating system  and our products might not be compatible with those operating systems 
if our products are not compatible with one or more of the operating systems with significant pc market share  we could incur substantial costs and expend significant capital and other resources to adapt our products to one or more operating systems 
there is no assurance that we would be able to adapt our products to changes made in the windows operating system in the future or to a new operating system  and any failure to adapt to changes in operating systems by the pc industry could result in significant harm to our business 
most of our customers require that the combination of our software products and their pcs be certified by microsoft s windows hardware qualification labs 
if certification is not obtained  our revenue could decline or our customers may license a competitor s software 
we sell most of our products through pc oems  which bundle our products with their hardware products 
most of our pc oem customers require microsoft s windows hardware qualifications labs  or whql  certification for our products on each pc platform before bundling and distribution 
the certification process is entirely under microsoft s control  and we may not obtain certification for any product on a timely basis or at all 
furthermore  microsoft may change the requirements for certification at any time without notice 
at various times in the past  microsoft has changed standards applicable to our products  which caused us to be out of compliance for a period of time 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain necessary certification on a timely basis  if at all  for new pc models introduced by our customers  for any of our products under development or for existing products  if the current standards are changed 
any delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  such certification could cause our revenue to decline or our customers to license a competitor s software

if microsoft develops or licenses digital video and audio solutions that compete directly with ours  our business could suffer 
microsoft currently offers products in the digital video and audio software markets 
some video and audio capabilities are built directly into their operating systems or are offered as upgrades to those operating systems at no additional charge 
if microsoft develops or licenses digital video and audio solutions that compete directly with ours and incorporates the solutions into its operating system  or otherwise changes its operating system or its windows hardware qualification labs standards to render our products incompatible  our business could be harmed 
competition in our industry is intense and is likely to continue to increase  which could result in price reductions  decreased customer orders  reduced product margins and loss of market share  any of which could harm our business 
our industry is highly competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
our competitors include software companies that offer digital video or audio applications  companies offering hardware or semiconductor solutions as alternatives to our software products  and operating system providers that may develop and integrate applications into their products 
our primary competitors are adobe systems incorporated  cyberlink corporation  pinnacle systems  inc  sonic solutions  inc 
and ulead systems  inc additional competitors are likely to enter our industry in the future 
we also face competition from the internal research and development departments of other software companies and pc and ce manufacturers  including some of our current customers 
some of our customers have the capability to integrate their operations vertically by developing their own software based digital and audio solutions or by acquiring our competitors or the rights to develop competitive products or technologies  which may allow these customers to reduce their purchases or cease purchasing from us completely 
operating system providers with an established customer base  such as microsoft  already offer products in the digital video and audio software markets 
some video and audio capabilities are built directly into their operating systems or are offered as upgrades to those operating systems at no additional charge 
if microsoft or other operating system providers develop or license digital video and audio solutions that compete directly with ours and incorporate the solutions into their operating systems  our products could lose market share 
we expect our current competitors to introduce similar or improved products at lower prices  and we will need to do the same to remain competitive 
for example  we expect revenues from dell to decline in successive quarters with the possibility of no revenue from dell in the future periods  because our current portion of their business is moving to one of our competitors 
we may not be able to compete successfully against either current or future competitors with respect to new or improved products 
we believe that competitive pressures may result in price reductions  reduced margins and our loss of market share 
many of our current competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources or greater name recognition than we do 
as a result  these competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
in addition  our competitors that have large market capitalizations or cash reserves are in a better position to acquire other companies in order to gain new technologies or products that may displace our products 
any of these potential acquisitions could give our competitors a strategic advantage 
in addition  some of our current competitors and potential competitors have greater brand name recognition  a more extensive customer base  more developed distribution channels and broader product offerings than we do 
these companies can use their broader customer base and product offerings  or adopt aggressive pricing policies  to gain market share

increased competition in the market may result in price reductions  decreased customer orders  reduced profit margins and loss of market share  any of which could harm our business 
if we do not provide acceptable customer support  our reputation will suffer and it will be difficult to retain existing customers or to acquire new customers 
we will need to continue to provide acceptable customer support to our customers 
an inability to do so will harm our reputation and make it difficult to retain existing customers or acquire new customers 
most of our experience to date has been with corporate customers  some of which require significant support when familiarizing themselves with the features and functionality of our products 
we intend to increase sales of our products directly to consumers 
we have limited experience with widespread distribution of our products directly to consumers  and we may not have adequate experience or personnel to provide the levels of support that these customers require 
our failure to provide adequate customer support for our products to either our corporate or consumer customers could damage our reputation and brand in the marketplace and strain our relationships with customers 
this could prevent us from retaining existing customers or acquiring new customers 
our ability to achieve profitability will suffer if we fail to manage our growth effectively 
our success depends on our ability to effectively manage the growth of our operations 
we cannot be certain that our current cost structure is appropriate for the level of revenue that we generate 
furthermore  we expect to increase the scope of our operations in the future 
to manage the growth of our operations and personnel  we will need to improve our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls as well as hire additional qualified personnel 
our current and planned systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations and expected growth 
delays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational systems and controls could harm our relationships with customers  reputation and brand 
the loss of any of our strategic relationships would make it more difficult to design competitive products and keep pace with evolving industry standards  which could reduce demand for our products and harm our business 
we must design our software products to interoperate effectively with a variety of hardware and software products  including operating system software  graphics chips  dvd drives  pcs and pc chipsets 
we depend on strategic relationships with software developers and manufacturers of these products  particularly microsoft and intel  to achieve our design objectives  to produce products that interoperate successfully  to provide us with information concerning customer preferences and evolving industry standards and trends  and to assist us in distributing our products to users 
for example  we have been able to learn about future product lines being developed by some of our oem customers in advance so that we were able to more efficiently design products that our customers  and the ultimate end users  find valuable 
however  we generally do not have any agreements with these third parties to ensure that such information will be provided to us  and these relationships may not continue in the future 
the loss of any one of these relationships could reduce demand for our products and harm our business 
our products may have defects or may be incompatible with other software or components contained in our customers products  which could cause us to lose customers  damage our reputation and create substantial costs 
defects  referred to in the software industry as bugs  have been found in our products in the past and may be found in the future 
in addition  our products may fail to meet our customers design specifications or be incompatible with other software or components contained in our customers products  or our customers may change their design specifications or add additional third party software or components after the production of our products 
we may be required to devote significant financial resources and personnel to correct any defects 

table of contents intervideo  inc 
a failure to meet our customers design specification often results in a loss of sales due to the length of time required to redesign the product 
our products may also be required to interface with defective third party software or components 
if we are unable to detect or fix errors  or meet our customers design specifications  our business and results of operations would suffer 
we may experience seasonality in our business  which could cause our operating results to fluctuate 
our financial condition and results of operations are likely to be affected by seasonality in the future 
historically  pc oems have experienced their highest volume of sales during the year end holiday season 
because of the timing of our recognition of revenue associated with the sale of our products to oems  we expect this seasonality to have a positive effect on our revenue and operating income in the first quarter of each calendar year and a negative effect on our revenue and operating income in the second quarter of that year 
to the extent our retail sales increase as a percentage of our revenue  we expect this would also result in greater seasonality in our results of operations 
the market for our products is new and constantly changing 
if we do not respond to changes in a timely manner  our products likely will no longer be competitive 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  new and improved product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
our future success will depend to a substantial extent on our ability to develop  introduce and support cost effective new products and technologies on a timely basis 
if we fail to develop and deploy new cost effective products and technologies or enhancements of existing products on a timely basis  or if we experience delays in the development  introduction or enhancement of our products and technologies  our products will no longer be competitive and our business will suffer 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may not be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new or enhanced products on a timely basis  if at all 
furthermore  our new products may never gain market acceptance  and we may not be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors  technological changes or emerging industry standards  such as high definition and blu ray dvd 
our failure to respond to product announcements  technological changes or changes in industry standards would likely prevent our products from gaining market acceptance and harm our business 
if we do not successfully establish strong brand identity in the pc and consumer electronics markets  we may be unable to achieve widespread acceptance of our products 
we believe that establishing and strengthening the intervideo brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and to establishing key strategic relationships 
the importance of brand recognition will increase as current and potential competitors enter the market with competing products 
our ability to promote and position our brand depends largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide high quality products and customer support 
these activities are expensive and we may not generate a corresponding increase in customers or revenue to justify these costs 
if we fail to establish and maintain our brand  or if our brand value is damaged or diluted  we may be unable to attract new customers and compete effectively 
historically  we have relied primarily on a limited direct sales force  supported by third party manufacturers representatives and distributors  to sell our products 
our sales strategy focuses primarily on our corporate customers bundling our products with their hardware and distributing our products through their own distribution channels 
we rely on our customers sales forces  marketing budgets and brand images to promote sales of bundled products 
if our corporate customers fail to successfully market and sell their products bundled with our products  or if our relationship with our corporate customers are terminated  we may be unable to effectively market and distribute our products and services

we rely on patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets and license agreements to protect our proprietary rights  which afford only limited protection 
our success depends upon our ability to protect our proprietary rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as license and confidentiality agreements with our employees  customers  strategic partners and others to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
the protection of patentable inventions is important to our future opportunities 
we currently have or own the rights to issued us patents  patents issued in taiwan and three in china and we have pending patent applications  comprised of us patent applications and foreign patent applications 
it is possible that our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents  we may not apply for or obtain effective patent protection in every country in which we do business  our patents may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights  any issued patent could be successfully challenged by one or more third parties  which could result in our loss of the right to prevent others from using the inventions claimed in those patents  we may be required to grant cross licenses to our patents in accordance with the terms of the agreements we enter into with customers or strategic partners  for business reasons we may choose not to enforce our patents against certain third parties  and current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design new products in a way that circumvents our patents 
existing copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and license and confidentiality agreements afford only limited protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  and policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products  potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue 
infringement claims and lawsuits would likely be expensive to resolve and would require management s time and resources and  therefore  could harm our business 
our success depends on retaining our key personnel  including our executive officers  the loss of any of whom could disrupt our operations or otherwise harm our business 
our success depends on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key engineering  sales and marketing and operations personnel 
competition for employees in our industry can be intense 
we do not have employment agreements with  or key man life insurance policies covering  any of our executives 
in addition  significant portions of the capital stock and options held by the members of our management are vested  and some of our executives are parties to agreements that provide for the acceleration of the vesting of a portion of their unvested shares and options under certain circumstances in connection with a change of control 
there can be no assurance that we will retain our key employees or be able to hire replacements 
our loss of any key employee or an inability to replace lost key employees and add new key employees as we grow could disrupt our operations or otherwise harm our business 
we rely on the accuracy of our customers sales reports for collecting and reporting revenue 
if these reports are not accurate  our reported revenue will be inaccurate 
a substantial majority of our revenue is generated by our pc oem and consumer electronics customers that pay us a license fee based upon the number of copies of our software they bundle with the pcs that they sell 
in collecting these fees  preparing our financial reports  projections and budgets and in directing our sales efforts 
table of contents intervideo  inc 
and product development  we rely on our customers to accurately report the number of units licensed 
we have never audited any of our customers to verify the accuracy of their reports or payments 
most of our license agreements permit us to audit our customers  but audits are expensive and time consuming and could harm our customer relationships 
from time to time  customers have provided us with inaccurate reports  which resulted in our under reporting or over reporting revenue for the associated period and recording an adjustment in a future period 
if any of our customer reports are inaccurate  the revenue we collect and report will be inaccurate and we may be required to make an adjustment to our revenue for a subsequent period  which could harm our business and credibility in the financial community 
our international operations accounted for of our revenue for the year ended december  and of our revenue for the year ended december   which may expose us to political  regulatory  economic  foreign exchange and operational risks 
because we sell our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from international sales 
we intend to expand our international operations in the future 
significant management attention and financial resources are needed to develop our international sales  support and distribution channels and manufacturing 
we may not be able to maintain international market demand for our products 
our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors related to international operations  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  seasonal fluctuations in sales  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic condition  particularly in emerging markets  unusual or burdensome foreign laws or regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to those laws or requirements  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  potentially adverse tax consequences  longer accounts receivable collection cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivables  difficulty in managing widespread sales  development and manufacturing operations  and less effective protection of intellectual property 
currently  most of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
therefore  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our current distribution agreements shift foreign exchange risk to our foreign distributors 
this exchange risk may harm the businesses of those distributors or make them less willing to carry and sell our products 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge foreign exchange risk 
in the future  a portion of our international revenue and expenses may be denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we could experience the risks of fluctuating currencies and may choose to engage in currency hedging activities 
in addition  if we conduct sales in local currencies  we may engage in hedging activities  which may not be successful and could expose us to additional risks 
in addition  we and certain of our oem customers maintain significant operations in asia 
any kind of economic  political or environmental instability in this region of the world could harm our operating results 
further  we may be impacted by the political  economic and military instability in taiwan

we may require substantial additional capital  which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including acceptance of  and demand for  our products  the costs of developing new products  the need to license new technology  to enter into license agreements for existing technology or to settle intellectual property matters  the extent to which we invest in new technology and research and development projects  the number and timing of acquisitions  including the to million committed to complete our tender offer for ulead  and the costs associated with our expansion 
to the extent the proceeds of this offering and our existing sources of cash and cash flow from operations are not sufficient to fund our activities  we may need to raise additional funds 
if we issue additional stock to raise capital  each stockholders percentage ownership in the company would be reduced 
additional financing may not be available when needed on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we raise funds through debt financing  we will have to pay interest and may be subject to restrictive covenants  which could limit our ability to take advantage of future opportunities  respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes 
if we cannot raise necessary additional capital on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes 
our stock price is volatile 
the price at which our common stock trades is likely to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors  some of which are actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations  changes in securities analysts expectations or our failure to meet those expectations  developments with respect to intellectual property rights  announcements of technological innovations or significant contracts by us or our competitors  introduction of new products by us or our competitors  commencement of or our involvement in litigation  our sale of common stock or other securities in the future  conditions and trends in technology industries  changes in market valuation or earnings of our competitors  the trading volume of our common stock  changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that has affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies 
in the past  these market fluctuations were often 
table of contents intervideo  inc 
unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
any significant fluctuations in the future might result in a significant decline in the market price of our common stock 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions that could discourage a third party from acquiring us and consequently cause our stock price to decline 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in management that a stockholder might consider favorable 
our certificate and bylaws  among other things  provide for a classified board of directors  require that stockholder actions occur at duly called meetings of the stockholders  limit who may call special meetings of stockholders and require advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations 
these provisions  along with the provisions of the delaware general corporation law  such as section  prohibiting certain business combinations with an interested stockholder  may delay or impede a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in management could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
other information consistent with section a i of the securities exchange act of as added by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are responsible for listing the non audit services pre approved in the fourth quarter of by our audit committee to be performed by kpmg llp  our external auditor 
during the third quarter ended september   kpmg performed certain due diligence procedures in connection with a strategic transaction 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk to date  most of our revenue has been denominated in us dollars 
we may  however  begin denominating revenue from selected international markets in the currency of the applicable market 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of some currencies in relation to the us dollar 
we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and in the future  we may use economic hedging techniques to minimize the effect of these exchange rate fluctuations that may harm our financial results 
for the year ended december   we did not have significant foreign currency denominated net assets or net liabilities positions  and had no foreign currency contracts outstanding 
interest rate risk we have limited exposure to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that we are not exposed to any material market risk 
in addition  our investment portfolio consists of investment grade securities diversified among security types  industries  and issuers 
our cash and investments are held and managed by recognized financial institutions that follow intervideo s investment policy 
our policy limits the amount of market exposure to any one security issue or issuer  and we believe no significant concentration of market risk exists with respect to these investments
