item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we derive our revenue primarily from sales of bis monitors  our original equipment manufacturer products including bis module kits and bisx and related accessories  which we collectively refer to as equipment  and sales of bis sensors 
for management purposes  we segregate our revenue by sales by region and sales by product group as shown in the following table in thousands domestic revenue percent of total revenue international revenue percent of total revenue total revenue bis sensor revenue percent of total revenue equipment revenue percent of total revenue total revenue at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of approximately million and working capital of approximately million 
we follow a system of fiscal quarters as opposed to calendar quarters 
under this system  the first three quarters of each fiscal year end on the saturday closest to the end of the calendar quarter and the last quarter of the fiscal year always ends on december we believe our ability to grow our revenue is directly related to our ability to sell our equipment to healthcare organizations and influence our customers after they purchase our equipment to continue to purchase and use our bis sensors 
we believe the increase in our installed base of equipment resulting from the sale of bis monitors and the sale of original equipment manufacturers equipment incorporating our bis module kit has been the primary reason for the growth in revenue from the sale of bis sensors 
in order to successfully grow our revenue  we need to continue to focus on both selling our equipment and improving our per monitor and per original equipment manufacturer products sensor utilization rate 
to achieve this growth  we continue to implement new sales and marketing programs 
we expect that as we grow our business  revenue from the sale of bis sensors will continue to contribute an increasing percentage of total revenue 
additionally  we believe that  over time  revenue from the sale of bis module kits and our bisx system will increase as a percentage of total equipment revenue as healthcare organizations purchase our technology as part of an integrated solution offered by our original equipment manufacturers 
we were profitable for the fiscal year ended december  we believe that maintaining our gross profit margin and controlling the growth of our operating expenses are important factors in sustaining profitability 
to maintain our gross profit margin we believe we must continue to focus on maintaining our average unit sales prices of our bis sensors  increasing revenue from the sale of bis sensors as a percentage of total revenue  as bis sensors have a higher gross profit margin than equipment  and continuing to reduce the costs of manufacturing our products 
for those healthcare organizations desiring to purchase our bis monitors directly from us  we offer two options 
our customers have the option either to purchase bis monitors outright or to acquire bis monitors pursuant to a sales type lease agreement whereby the customer contractually commits to purchase a minimum number of bis sensors per bis monitor per year 
under our sales type leases  customers purchase bis sensors and the bis monitor for the purchase price of the bis sensors plus an additional charge per bis sensor to pay for the purchase price of the bis monitor and related financing costs over the term of the 
table of contents agreement 
we also grant these customers an option to purchase the bis monitors at the end of the term of the agreement  which is typically three to five years 
we recognize equipment revenue under sales type lease agreements either at shipment or delivery in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with interest income recognized over the life of the sales type lease 
the cost of the bis monitor acquired by the customer is recorded as costs of revenue in the same period 
sales type leases accounted for approximately  and of total revenue in  and  respectively 
under certain limited circumstances  we also offer customers the opportunity to use the bis monitors under our equipment placement program  which we refer to as the ep program 
under the ep program  the customer is granted the right to use the bis monitors for a mutually agreed upon period of time 
during this period  the customer purchases bis sensors at a price that includes a premium above the list price of the bis sensors to cover the rental of the equipment  but without any minimum purchase commitments 
at the end of the agreed upon period  the customer has the option of purchasing the bis monitors  continuing to use them under the ep program or returning them to us 
we have subsidiaries in the netherlands and the united kingdom to facilitate the sale of our products into the international market 
we are continuing to develop our international sales and distribution program through a combination of distributors and marketing partners  including companies with which we have entered into original equipment manufacturer relationships 
in january  we entered into a distribution agreement with nihon kohden corporation to distribute bis monitors in japan 
in march  nihon kohden received approval from the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare for marketing in japan our a eeg monitor with bis and in may  received approval for marketing in japan our a bis monitor 
nihon kohden has requested  but has not yet received  approval to market the bis xp system in japan 
in january  the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare granted reimbursement approval for use of our bis monitors 
with this approval  healthcare providers in japan are eligible to receive partial reimbursement of  yen each time bis monitoring is used 
in july  the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare approved our bis module for marketing in japan 
sales to nihon kohden represented approximately  and  respectively  of international revenue in  and  respectively 
various factors may adversely affect our quarterly operating results through the first fiscal quarter of and beyond 
these factors may have a potentially adverse effect on equipment revenue and gross profit margin on equipment as we continue to shift the focus of our placements from bis monitors to bis modules and bisx systems 
in addition  in japan  nihon kohden is awaiting approval of the bis xp system  and we believe customers in japan may continue to delay purchases of our products or may choose not to purchase our products pending this approval 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k includes a summary of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made estimates and judgments in determining certain amounts included in the financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we do not believe there is a significant likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows revenue recognition we sell our bis monitors primarily through a combination of a direct sales force and distributors 
our original equipment manufacturer products are sold to original equipment manufacturers who in turn sell them to the end user 
bis sensors are sold through a combination of a direct sales force  distributors and original 
table of contents equipment manufacturers 
direct product sales are structured as sales  sales type lease arrangements or sales under our ep program 
we recognize revenue from product sales when earned in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  or eitf   revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for product sales  revenue is not recognized until title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
we also recognize revenue from prepaid license and royalty fees 
this revenue is deferred until product shipment or delivery in accordance with the terms of the agreement and license and royalty fees are earned in accordance with the terms of the respective agreements 
in august  we recorded approximately  of deferred revenue related to an oem product development and distribution agreement with boston scientific corporation 
the deferred revenue is being recognized ratably over the term of the oem product development and distribution agreement  as amended  which represents our best estimate of our period of significant continuing obligation to provide boston scientific corporation exclusive distribution rights to newly developed technology 
we amended the oem product development and distribution agreement in january and extended the estimate of our period of significant continuing obligation by two years 
this will reduce the revenue that we record on a quarterly basis by approximately  in and beyond 
if our estimate of the period of significant continuing obligation is revised  this may have an impact on our revenue recognition of the deferred revenue related to the boston scientific corporation agreement 
we follow statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for leases  for our sales type lease agreements 
under our sales type leases  customers purchase bis sensors and the bis monitor for the purchase price of the bis sensors plus an additional charge per bis sensor to pay for the purchase price of the bis monitor and related financing costs over the term of the agreement 
the minimum lease payment  consisting of the additional charge per bis sensor  less the unearned interest income  which is computed at the interest rate implicit in the lease  is recorded as the net investment in sales type leases 
we recognize equipment revenue under sales type lease agreements either at shipment or delivery in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with interest income recognized over the life of the sales type lease 
the cost of the bis monitor acquired by the customer is recorded as costs of revenue in the same period 
we review and assess the net realizability of our investment in sales type leases at each reporting period 
this review includes determining  on a customer specific basis  if a customer is significantly underperforming relative to the customer s cumulative level of committed bis sensor purchases as required by the sales type lease agreement 
if a customer is underperforming  we record an allowance for lease payments as a charge to revenue to reflect the lower estimate of the net realizable investment in sales type lease balance 
we recognize revenue either at shipment or delivery in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with distributors and original equipment manufacturers in accordance with sab no 
sales to distributors and original equipment manufacturers include a clause in the contracts that indicates that customer acceptance is limited to confirmation that our products function in accordance with our applicable product specifications in effect at the time of delivery 
formal acceptance by the distributor or original equipment manufacturer is not necessary to recognize revenue provided that we objectively demonstrate that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions are satisfied 
each product is tested prior to shipment to ensure that it meets the applicable product specifications in effect at the time of delivery 
additionally  we have historically had a minimal number of defective products shipped to distributors and original equipment manufacturers and any defective products are subject to repair or replacement under warranty as distributors and original equipment manufacturers do not have a right of return 
allowance for doubtful accounts we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by using estimates based on our historical collections experience  current trends  historical write offs of our receivables  credit policy and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
we also review the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in our credit policies 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  our credit loss rates 
table of contents in the future may not be consistent with our historical experience 
to the extent we experience a deterioration in our historical collections experience or increased credit losses  bad debt expense would likely increase in future periods 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or estimated market  and determine cost on a first in  first out basis 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on production history and on our estimated forecast of product demand 
the medical industry in which we market our products is characterized by rapid product development and technological advances that could result in obsolescence of inventory 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we would need to change our estimate of the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory 
if revisions are deemed necessary  we would recognize the adjustments in the form of a charge to costs of revenue at the time of the determination 
therefore  although we continually update our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated declines in demand or technological developments  such as the introduction of new products by our competitors  could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
warranty equipment that we sell generally is covered by a warranty period of one year 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on our historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  to the extent we experience an increased number of warranty claims or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty expenses will increase  and we may experience decreased gross profit margin and cash flow 
results of operations the following tables present  for the periods indicated  information expressed as a percentage of revenue and a summary of our total revenue

net income loss 
as a result of the factors discussed above  in we had net income of approximately  compared with a net loss of approximately million in we did not record a provision for income taxes for the year ended december  as we have significant deferred tax assets available to offset any income tax liabilities and expenses 
at december   we had a full valuation allowance against these gross deferred tax assets as we have determined that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized

the increase in revenue from the sale of bis sensors from to was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately in the number of bis sensors sold as a result of growth in the installed base of bis monitors and bis modules 
the increase in the number of bis sensors sold was complemented by an increase in the average selling price of bis sensors of approximately 
our installed base of bis monitors and bis modules increased approximately to  units at december  compared to  units at december  the increase in revenue from the sale of equipment from to was primarily driven by an increase in bis module kit revenue of approximately 
the increase in module revenue for this period was due to an increase of approximately in the number of bis module kits shipped to our original equipment manufacturers  from  bis module kits in to  bis module kits in the increase in bis module kit revenue in this period was partially offset by a decrease in bis monitor revenue of approximately 
the decrease in bis monitor revenue resulted from a decrease of approximately in unit volume  as we shipped  bis monitors in compared to  bis monitors in the decrease in monitor unit volume was a result of a decrease of approximately in international bis monitors shipped  particularly relating to units shipped to japan 
sales of bis monitor units in japan decreased from units shipped in to none in as nihon kohden delayed additional bis monitor purchases pending the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare approval of the bis xp technology 
our gross profit margin was approximately of revenue in as compared to a gross profit margin of approximately of revenue in the increase in gross profit margin for the year ended december  was a result of four factors 
first  we experienced increased sales of our bis sensors as a percentage of total revenue during the year ended december  bis sensors accounted for approximately of total revenue for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  bis sensors have a higher gross profit margin than equipment 
second  we had an increase in the worldwide average unit price on bis monitors of approximately in compared to third  we have had a reduction in depreciation expense related to bis monitors used in the ep program as the existing pool of bis monitors becomes fully depreciated and we substantially reduce our focus and reliance on the ep program 
finally  we recognized approximately  of deferred revenue in the year ended december  related to the strategic alliance with boston scientific corporation without any corresponding costs of revenue  increasing the gross profit margin by approximately

we had capital expenditures of approximately million for the year ended december   which related primarily to the purchase of manufacturing equipment for use in the production of our bis sensors and the purchase of computer hardware and third party software 
at december   we did not have any commitments for capital expenditures  however  we anticipate that the level of capital expenditures in will increase from the level of capital expenditures during the year ended december  we have summarized below our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period less than one to three three to five after five contractual obligations total one year years years years operating leases debt related to the sale of investment in sales type leases purchase commitment total contractual cash obligations in february  we entered into an agreement with the supplier of our electronic memory device used in the xp family of our disposable sensors to purchase a sufficient quantity of these electronic memory devices to maintain our inventory levels through at least the end of this commitment is expected to be approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
income taxes we have net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately  and  respectively  and tax credits for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately  and  respectively 
these tax attributes began expiring in and will continue to expire through if not utilized 
additionally  the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review by the internal revenue service 
ownership changes  as defined under sections and in the internal revenue code  may limit the amount of these tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities 
the amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the company s value immediately prior to the ownership change 
subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years 
we have substantial net operating loss carryforwards that have generated significant deferred tax assets 
we have provided a full valuation allowance against these 
table of contents deferred tax assets as we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to fully utilize these net operating loss carryforwards 
effects of inflation we believe that inflation and changing prices over the past three years have not had a significant impact on our revenue or on our results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement no

 statement of cash flows 
under sfas no 
r  we must calculate and record in the income statement the cost of equity instruments  such as stock options or restricted stock  awarded to employees for services received  pro forma disclosure is not longer permitted 
the cost of the equity instruments is to be measured based on fair value of the instruments on the date they are granted with certain exceptions and is required to be recognized over the period during which the employees are required to provide services in exchange for the equity instruments 
the statement is effective in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  sfas no 
r provides two alternatives for adoption a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the effective date of this statement as well as for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which follows the approach in the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate prior periods to record compensation cost calculated under sfas no 
for the pro forma disclosure 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
r as of july   the beginning of our third fiscal quarter of since we currently account for stock options granted to employees and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan in accordance with the intrinsic value method permitted under apb opinion no 
 no compensation expense generally is recognized 
management expects that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
r on periods after adoption cannot be accurately estimated at this time  as it will depend on the market value and the amount of share based awards granted in future periods 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no

our customers may determine that the cost of the bis system exceeds cost savings in drugs  personnel and post anesthesia care recovery resulting from use of the bis system 
in addition  hospitals and anesthesia providers may not accept the bis system as an accurate means of assessing a patient s level of consciousness during surgery or in the intensive care unit 
if extensive or frequent malfunctions occur  healthcare providers may also conclude that the bis system is unreliable 
if hospitals and anesthesia providers do not accept the bis system as cost effective  accurate and reliable  they will not buy and use the bis system in sufficient quantities to enable us to continue to be profitable 
the success of our business also depends in a large part on continued use of the bis system by our customers and  accordingly  sales by us of bis sensors 
we expect that over time  sales of bis sensors will increase as a percentage of our revenue as compared to sales of equipment as we build our installed base of monitors and modules 
if use of our bis system  and accordingly  sales of our bis sensors  do not increase  our ability to grow our revenue could be adversely affected 
we depend on our bis system for substantially all of our revenue  and if the bis system does not gain widespread market acceptance  then our revenue will not grow 
we began selling our current bis system in early and introduced the latest version  the bis xp system  at the end of the third fiscal quarter of in  we introduced commercially the bis extend sensor for patients who are monitored over an extended period of time  such as in intensive care unit settings 
to date  we have not achieved widespread market acceptance of the bis system for use in the operating room or in the intensive care unit from healthcare providers or professional anesthesia organizations 
because we depend on our bis system for substantially all of our revenue and we have no other significant products  if we fail to achieve widespread market acceptance for the bis system  we will not be able to sustain or grow our product revenue 
various market factors may adversely affect our quarterly operating results through the first fiscal quarter of various factors may adversely affect our quarterly operating results through the first fiscal quarter of first  we continue to shift the focus of our placements from bis monitors to original equipment manufacturer products which may lead to a reduction in equipment revenue and gross margin on equipment 
second  in japan  nihon kohden is awaiting approval of the bis xp system from the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare which may cause delays in purchasing decisions by customers in japan  or these potential customers may choose not to purchase our products 
the continuation of difficult worldwide economic conditions  reductions in hospital purchasing programs and the cost of transitioning our installed base to the bis xp system may also adversely impact our revenue and operating results through the first fiscal quarter of additionally  on october   the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations  or jcaho  issued a sentinel event alert aimed at preventing and managing the impact of anesthesia awareness 
the alert identifies the incidence of awareness  describes common underlying causes and suggests steps for healthcare professionals and institutions to take in order to manage and prevent future occurrences and recommends healthcare organizations develop and implement policies to address anesthesia awareness 
while we believe this report is favorable to our business  industry organizations and others in the anesthesia community may not agree with the position taken in the alert and  accordingly  potential benefits to our business that could have resulted from this alert may not be realized 

table of contents fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could cause our stock price to decrease 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to vary in the future 
these fluctuations are due to several factors relating to the sale of our products  including the timing and volume of customer orders for our bis system  implementation of  and our subsequent reduction on the focus of  our ep program  use of and demand for our bis sensors  transition of sales focus from bis monitors to original equipment manufacturer products  customer cancellations  introduction of competitive products  regulatory approvals  changes in management  turnover in our direct sales force  effectiveness of new marketing and sales programs  reductions in orders by our distributors and original equipment manufacturers  and the timing and amount of our expenses 
because of these fluctuations  it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if our quarterly operating results are below expectations in the future  the market price of our common stock would likely decrease 
in addition  because we do not have a substantial backlog of customer orders for our bis system  revenue in any quarter depends on orders received in that quarter 
our quarterly results may also be adversely affected because some customers may have inadequate financial resources to purchase our products or may fail to pay for our products after receiving them 
in particular  hospitals continue to experience financial constraints  consolidations and reorganizations as a result of cost containment measures and declining third party reimbursement for services  which may result in decreased product orders or an increase in bad debt allowances in any quarter 
if the estimates we make  and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate  our actual results may vary from those reflected in our financial statements 
our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
this includes estimates on warranty reserves  inventory valuations and allowances for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance  however  that our estimates  or the assumptions underlying them  will be correct 
if approval of our bis xp system is not obtained in japan  our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected 
in japan  nihon kohden is awaiting approval of the bis xp system from the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare 
until approval is obtained  customers in japan may delay their purchasing decisions with respect to our products or may decide not to purchase our products at all 
as a result  if approval for this product is not obtained in japan in the near future  or at all  it could limit the growth of our international revenue 

table of contents we may need additional financing for our future capital needs and may not be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we believe that the financial resources available to us  including our current working capital and available revolving lines of credit  will be sufficient to finance our planned operations and capital expenditures through at least the end of if we are unable to increase our revenue and maintain positive cash flow  we will need to raise additional funds 
we may also need additional financing if the research and development costs of our products currently under development increase  we decide to expand faster than currently planned  we develop new or enhanced services or products ahead of schedule  we decide to undertake new sales and or marketing initiatives  we are required to defend or enforce our intellectual property rights  sales of our products do not meet our expectations domestically or internationally  we need to respond to competitive pressures  or we decide to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if future financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to fund our future operations which would significantly limit our ability to implement our business plan 
in addition  we may have to issue securities that may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock 
cases of awareness with recall during monitoring with the bis system could limit market acceptance of bis systems and could expose us to product liability claims 
clinicians have reported to us cases of possible awareness with recall during surgical procedures monitored with the bis system 
in most of the cases that were reported to us  when bis index values were recorded at the time of awareness  high bis index values were noted  indicating that the bis index correctly identified the increased risk of awareness with recall in these patients 
however  in a small number of these reported cases  awareness with recall may not have been detected by monitoring with the bis system 
we have not systematically solicited reports of awareness with recall 
it is possible that additional cases of awareness with recall during surgical procedures monitored with the bis system have not been reported to us 
anesthesia providers and hospitals may elect not to purchase and use bis systems if there is adverse publicity resulting from the report of cases of awareness with recall that were not detected during procedures monitored with the bis system 
if anesthesia providers and hospitals do not purchase and use the bis system  then we may not sustain or grow our product revenue 
although our multi center  multinational clinical studies have demonstrated that the use of bis monitoring to help guide anesthetic administration may be associated with the reduction of the incidence of awareness with recall in adults using general anesthesia and sedation  we may be subject to product liability claims for cases of awareness with recall during surgical procedures monitored with the bis system 
these claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
moreover  if the patient safety benefits of bis monitoring are not persuasive enough to lead to wider adoption of our bis technology  our business could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to compete with new products or alternative techniques developed by others  which could impair our ability to remain competitive and achieve future growth 
the medical device industry in which we market our products is characterized by rapid product development and technological advances 
our competitors have introduced commercially anesthesia monitoring products which have been cleared by the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
if we do 
table of contents not compete effectively with these monitoring products  our revenue will be adversely affected 
our current or planned products are at risk of obsolescence from other new monitoring products  based on new or improved technologies  new products or technologies used on patients or in the operating room during surgery in lieu of monitoring devices  electrical or mechanical interference from new or existing products or technologies  alternative techniques for evaluating the effects of anesthesia  significant changes in the methods of delivering anesthesia  and the development of new anesthetic agents 
we may not be able to improve our products or develop new products or technologies quickly enough to maintain a competitive position in our markets and continue to grow our business 
if we do not successfully develop and introduce enhanced or new products we could lose revenue opportunities and customers 
as the market for our bis system matures  we need to develop and introduce new products for anesthesia monitoring or other applications 
in  we introduced commercially the bis extend sensor for patients who are typically monitored for an extended period of time  such as in intensive care unit settings 
we do not know whether the use of the bis system in the intensive care unit will achieve market acceptance 
in addition  we have begun to research the use of bis monitoring to diagnose and track neurological diseases  and face at least the following two related risks we may not successfully adapt the bis system to function properly for procedural sedation  when used with anesthetics we have not tested or with patient populations we have not studied  such as infants  and our technology is complex  and we may not be able to develop it further for applications outside anesthesia monitoring  such as the diagnosis and tracking of neurological diseases 
if we do not successfully adapt the bis system for new products and applications both within and outside the field of anesthesia monitoring  or if such products and applications are developed but not successfully commercialized  then we could lose revenue opportunities and customers 
if we do not develop and implement a successful sales and marketing strategy  we will not expand our business 
in the past  we have experienced high turnover in our direct sales force 
it is possible that high turnover may occur in the future 
if new sales representatives do not acquire the technological skills to sell our products in a timely and successful manner or we experience high turnover in our direct sales force  we may not be able to sustain and grow our product revenue 
in addition  in order to increase our sales  we need to continue to strengthen our relationships with our international distributors and continue to add international distributors 
also  we need to continue to strengthen our relationships with our original equipment manufacturers and other sales channels and increase sales through these channels 
on an ongoing basis  we develop and introduce new sales and marketing programs and clinical education programs to promote the use of the bis system by our customers 
if we do not implement these new sales and marketing and education programs in a timely and successful manner  we may not be able to achieve the level of market awareness and sales required to expand our business 
we have only limited sales and marketing experience both in the united states and internationally and may not be successful in developing and implementing our strategy 
among other things  we need to provide or assure that distributors and original equipment manufacturers provide the technical and educational support customers need to use the bis system successfully  
table of contents promote frequent use of the bis system so that sales of our disposable bis sensors increase  establish and implement successful sales and marketing and education programs that encourage our customers to purchase our products or the products that are made by original equipment manufacturers incorporating our technology  manage geographically dispersed operations  and modify our products and marketing and sales programs for foreign markets 
our third party distribution and original equipment manufacturer relationships could negatively affect our profitability  cause sales of our products to decline and be difficult to terminate if we are dissatisfied 
sales through distributors could be less profitable than direct sales 
sales of our products through multiple channels could also confuse customers and cause the sale of our products to decline 
we do not control our original equipment manufacturers and distribution partners 
our partners could sell competing products  may not incorporate our technology into their products in a timely manner and may devote insufficient sales efforts to our products 
in addition  our partners are generally not required to purchase minimum quantities 
as a result  even if we are dissatisfied with the performance of our partners  we may be unable to terminate our agreements with these partners or enter into alternative arrangements 
we may not be able to generate enough additional revenue from our international expansion to offset the costs associated with establishing and maintaining foreign operations 
a component of our growth strategy is to expand our presence in international markets 
we conduct international business primarily in europe and japan and we are attempting to increase the number of countries in which we do business 
it is costly to establish international facilities and operations and to promote the bis system in international markets 
we have encountered barriers to the sale of our bis system outside the united states  including less acceptance by anesthesia providers for use of disposable products  such as bis sensors  delays in regulatory approvals outside of the united states  particularly in japan  and difficulties selling through indirect sales channels 
in addition  we have little experience in marketing and distributing products in these markets 
revenue from international activities may not offset the expense of establishing and maintaining these international operations 
we may not be able to meet the unique operational  legal and financial challenges that we will encounter in our international operations  which may limit the growth of our business 
we are increasingly subject to a number of challenges which specifically relate to our international business activities 
these challenges include failure of local laws to provide adequate protection against infringement of our intellectual property  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  which could slow our growth in international markets  difficulties in terminating or modifying distributor arrangements because of restrictions in markets outside the united states  less acceptance by foreign anesthesia providers of the use of disposable products  such as bis sensors  delays in regulatory approval of our products  
table of contents currency conversion issues arising from sales denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  longer sales cycles to sell products like the bis system to hospitals and outpatient surgical centers  which could slow our revenue growth from international sales  and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable 
if we are unable to meet and overcome these challenges  our international operations may not be successful which would limit the growth of our business and could adversely impact our results of operations 
we may experience customer dissatisfaction and our reputation could suffer if we fail to manufacture enough products to meet our customers demands 
we rely on third party manufacturers to assemble and manufacture the components of our bis monitors  original equipment manufacturer products and a portion of our bis sensors 
we manufacture substantially all bis sensors in our own manufacturing facility 
we have only one manufacturing facility 
if we fail to produce enough products at our own manufacturing facility or at a third party manufacturing facility for any reason  including damage or destruction of our facility  or experience a termination or modification of any manufacturing arrangement with a third party  we may be unable to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
our failure to deliver products on a timely basis could lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage our reputation 
our reliance on sole source suppliers could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers demands for our products in a timely manner or within budget 
some of the components that are necessary for the assembly of our bis system  including some of the components used in our bis sensors  are currently provided to us by sole source suppliers or a limited group of suppliers 
we purchase components through purchase orders rather than long term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory 
we have experienced shortages and delays in obtaining some of the components of our bis systems in the past  and we may experience similar shortages or delays in the future 
the disruption or termination of the supply of components could cause a significant increase in the costs of these components  which could affect our profitability 
a disruption or termination in the supply of components could also result in our inability to meet demand for our products  which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage our reputation 
if a supplier is no longer willing or able to manufacture components that we purchase and integrate into the bis system  we may attempt to design replacement components ourselves that would be compatible with our existing technology 
in doing so  we would incur additional research and development expenses  and there can be no assurance that we would be successful in designing or manufacturing any replacement components 
furthermore  if we are required to change the manufacturer of a key component of the bis system  we may be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines 
the delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could delay our ability to manufacture bis systems in a timely manner or within budget 
we may be required to bring litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  which may result in substantial expense and may divert our attention from the implementation of our business strategy 
we believe that the success of our business depends  in part  on obtaining patent protection for our products  defending our patents once obtained and preserving our trade secrets 
we rely on a combination of contractual provisions  confidentiality procedures and patent  trademark and trade secret laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
these legal measures afford only limited protection  and competitors may gain access to our intellectual property and proprietary information 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of 
table of contents our proprietary rights 
any litigation could result in substantial expense and diversion of our attention from the growth of the business and may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property rights 
we may be sued by third parties which claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights  particularly because there is substantial uncertainty about the validity and breadth of medical device patents 
we may be exposed to litigation by third parties based on claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
this risk is exacerbated by the fact that the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
any litigation or claims against us  whether or not valid  could result in substantial costs  could place a significant strain on our financial resources and could harm our reputation 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following cease selling  incorporating or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  which would adversely affect our revenue  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  and redesign our products  which may be costly and time consuming 
we could be exposed to significant product liability claims which could divert management attention and adversely affect our cash balances  our ability to obtain and maintain insurance coverage at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts and our reputation 
the manufacture and sale of our products expose us to product liability claims and product recalls  including those which may arise from misuse or malfunction of  or design flaws in  our products or use of our products with components or systems not manufactured or sold by us 
product liability claims or product recalls  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
we currently maintain product liability insurance  however  it may not cover the costs of any product liability claims made against us 
furthermore  we may not be able to obtain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts 
in addition  publicity pertaining to the misuse or malfunction of  or design flaws in  our products could impair our ability to successfully market and sell our products 
several class action lawsuits have been filed against the underwriters of our initial public offering which may result in negative publicity and potential litigation against us that would be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain and may harm our business 
the underwriters of our initial public offering are named as defendants in several class action complaints which have been filed allegedly on behalf of certain persons who purchased shares of our common stock between january  and december  these complaints allege violations of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of primarily they allege that there was undisclosed compensation received by our underwriters in connection with our initial public offering 
while we and our officers and directors have not been named as defendants in these suits  based on comparable lawsuits filed against other companies  there can be no assurance that we and our officers and directors will not be named in similar complaints in the future 
in addition  the underwriters may assert that we are liable for some or all of any liability that they are found to have to the plaintiffs  pursuant to the indemnification provisions of the underwriting agreement we entered into as part of the initial public offering  or otherwise 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of these complaints or any potential suit against us or our officers and directors 
any conclusion of these matters in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 
in addition  the costs to us of defending any litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general 
even if we are not named as defendants 
table of contents in these lawsuits  we may also be required to incur significant costs and our management may be distracted by being required to provide information  documents or testimony in connection with the actions against our underwriters 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation or other proceedings and the negative publicity associated with this litigation could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace 
boston scientific corporation may be able to affect corporate actions requiring stockholder approval because it owns a significant amount of our common stock  and  if our strategic alliance with boston scientific corporation is not successful  our operating results could be adversely affected 
as of march   boston scientific corporation owned approximately of our outstanding common stock  which includes  shares of our common stock that we sold to boston scientific corporation on june  if boston scientific corporation maintains or increases its ownership of our outstanding common stock  it may have the ability to affect corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
on august   we formed a strategic alliance with boston scientific corporation 
in connection with this strategic alliance  we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we granted boston scientific corporation an option to distribute newly developed technology for monitoring patients under sedation in a range of less invasive medical specialties 
if such products are not successfully developed  marketed and sold under the agreement in a manner consistent with our expectations  the growth of our business and our operating results will be adversely affected 
even if we successfully develop new sedation management technology for less invasive medical procedures  aspect and boston scientific corporation may not successfully market and sell this new technology 
we may not reserve amounts adequate to cover product obsolescence  claims and returns  which could result in unanticipated expenses and fluctuations in operating results 
depending on factors such as the timing of our introduction of new products which utilize our bis technology  as well as warranty claims and product returns  we may need to reserve amounts in excess of those currently reserved for product obsolescence  excess inventory  warranty claims and product returns 
these reserves may not be adequate to cover all costs associated with these items 
if these reserves are inadequate  we would be required to incur unanticipated expenses which could result in unexpected fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
we may not be able to compete effectively  which could result in price reductions and decreased demand for our products 
we are facing increased competition in the domestic level of consciousness monitoring market as a result of a number of competitors monitoring systems which have been cleared by the fda 
these products are marketed by well established medical products companies with significant resources 
we may not be able to compete effectively with these and other potential competitors 
we may also face substantial competition from companies which may develop sensor products that compete with our proprietary bis sensors for use with our bis monitors or with third party monitoring systems or anesthesia delivery systems that incorporate the bis index 
we also expect to face competition from companies currently marketing conventional electroencephalogram  or eeg  monitors using standard and novel signal processing techniques 
other companies may develop anesthesia monitoring systems that perform better than the bis system and or sell for less 
in addition  one or more of our competitors may develop products that are substantially equivalent to our fda approved products  in which case they may be able to use our products as predicate devices to more quickly obtain fda approval of their competing products 
medical device companies developing these and other competitive products may have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
competition in the sale of anesthesia monitoring systems could result in price reductions  fewer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

table of contents our ability to market and sell our products and generate revenue depends upon receipt of domestic and foreign regulatory approval of our products and manufacturing operations 
before we can market new products in the united states  we must obtain clearance from the fda 
if the fda concludes that any of our products do not meet the requirements to obtain clearance of a premarket notification under section k of the food  drug and cosmetic act  then we would be required to file a premarket approval application 
the premarket approval application process is lengthy  expensive and typically requires extensive preclinical and clinical trial data 
we may not obtain clearance of a k notification or approval of a premarket approval application with respect to any of our products on a timely basis  if at all 
if we fail to obtain timely clearance or approval for our products  we will not be able to market and sell our products  which will limit our ability to generate revenue 
we may also be required to obtain clearance of a k notification from the fda before we can market certain previously marketed products which we modify after they have been cleared 
we have made certain enhancements to our currently marketed products which we have determined do not necessitate the filing of a new k notification 
however  if the fda does not agree with our determination  it will require us to file a new k notification for the modification and we may be prohibited from marketing the modified device until we obtain fda clearance 
the fda also requires us to adhere to current good manufacturing practices regulations  which include production design controls  testing  quality control  storage and documentation procedures 
the fda may at any time inspect our facilities to determine whether adequate compliance has been achieved 
compliance with current good manufacturing practices regulations for medical devices is difficult and costly 
in addition  we may not continue to be compliant as a result of future changes in  or interpretations of  regulations by the fda or other regulatory agencies 
if we do not achieve continued compliance  the fda may withdraw marketing clearance or require product recall 
when any change or modification is made to a device or its intended use  the manufacturer may be required to reassess compliance with current good manufacturing practices regulations  which may cause interruptions or delays in the marketing and sale of our products 
sales of our products outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary from country to country 
the time required to obtain approvals from foreign countries may be longer than that required for fda approval  and requirements for foreign licensing may differ from fda requirements 
the federal  state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to future changes  as are administrative interpretations of regulatory agencies 
if we fail to comply with applicable federal  state or foreign laws or regulations  we could be subject to enforcement actions  including product seizures  recalls  withdrawal of clearances or approvals and civil and criminal penalties 
if we do not retain our senior management and other key employees  we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy 
our president and chief executive officer  nassib chamoun  joined us at our inception in our chairman  j 
breckenridge eagle  began serving as a director in many other members of our management and key employees have extensive experience with us and other companies in the medical device industry 
our success is substantially dependent on the ability  experience and performance of these members of our senior management and other key employees 
because of their ability and experience  if we lose one or more of the members of our senior management or other key employees  our ability to successfully implement our business strategy could be seriously harmed 
if we do not attract and retain skilled personnel  we will not be able to expand our business 
our products are based on complex signal processing technology 
accordingly  we require skilled personnel to develop  manufacture  sell and support our products 
our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue to hire  train  retain and motivate additional skilled personnel  particularly sales representatives who are responsible for customer education and training and post installation customer support 
consequently  if we are not able to attract and retain skilled personnel  we will not be able to expand our business 

table of contents failure of users of the bis system to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors could limit market acceptance of the bis system  which could prevent us from sustaining profitability 
anesthesia providers are generally not reimbursed separately for patient monitoring activities utilizing the bis system 
for hospitals and outpatient surgical centers  when reimbursement is based on charges or costs  patient monitoring with the bis system may reduce reimbursements for surgical procedures  because charges or costs may decline as a result of monitoring with the bis system 
failure by hospitals and other users of the bis system to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors  or any reduction in the reimbursement by third party payors to hospitals and other users as a result of using the bis system could limit market acceptance of the bis system  which could prevent us from achieving profitability 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate exposure our investment portfolio consists primarily of high grade commercial paper  high grade corporate bonds and debt obligations of various governmental agencies 
we manage our investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs  and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
investments are made with an average maturity of months or less and a maximum maturity of months 
these investments are subject to risk of default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of the debt instruments  we believe interest rate risk is mitigated 
our investment policy specifies the credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investment in sales type leases  line of credit agreements and sales type lease debt agreements are also subject to market risk 
the interest rates implicit in our sales type leases and on our sales type lease debt agreements are fixed and not subject to interest rate risk 
the interest rates on our line of credit agreements are variable and subject to interest rate risk 
the interest rate risk related to the lines of credit is mitigated primarily by the fact that the lines of credit  when drawn on  are generally outstanding for short periods of time in order to fund short term cash requirements 
foreign currency exposure most of our revenue  expenses and capital spending are transacted in us dollars 
the expenses and capital spending of our two international subsidiaries are transacted in the respective country s local currency and subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our foreign currency transactions are translated into us dollars at prevailing rates 
gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in current period income or loss as incurred 
currently  all material transactions are denominated in us dollars  and we have not entered into any material transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies
