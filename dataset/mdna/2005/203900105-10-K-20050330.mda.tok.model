critical accounting policies allowance for doubtful accounts we record a provision for doubtful accounts receivable based on specific identification of doubtful accounts 
this involves a degree of judgement based on discussion with our internal sales and marketing groups  our customer base and the examination of the financial stability of our customers 
there can be no assurance that our estimates will match actual amounts ultimately written off 
during periods of downturn in the market for our products or economic recession  a greater degree of risk exists concerning the ultimate collectability of our accounts receivable due to the impact that these conditions might have on our customer base 
sales returns an allowance is established for possible return of products  rebates and advertising allowances 
the amount of the allowance is an estimate  which is based on historical ratios of returns to sales  the historical average length of time between the sale and the return and other factors 
though management considers these allowances adequate and proper  changes in customers behavior versus historical experience or changes in the company s return policies are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
inventory valuation the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
reserves for overstock and obsolescence are estimated and recorded to reduce the carrying value to estimated net realizable value 
the amount of the reserve is determined based on projected sales information  plans for discontinued products and other factors

income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management calculates income taxes 
this includes estimating the company s current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
these assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
the valuation allowance for deferred income tax benefits is determined based upon the expectation of whether the benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
warranty we provide a standard product warranty program for our product lines and a five year warranty on certain equipment purchased from two vendors and installed at our customer locations 
we provide reserves for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on our warranty policy or applicable contractual warranty  our historical experience of known product failure rates  our vendors experience and use of materials and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
management reviews the estimated warranty liability on a quarterly basis to determine its adequacy 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in the company s warranty policy or a significant change in product defects versus historical experience are among the factors that could result in materially different amounts for this item 
goodwill impairment beginning in  goodwill is required to be evaluated annually for impairment  according to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the standard requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
step one is to test for potential impairment  and requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to its book value including goodwill 
if the fair value is higher than the book value  no impairment is recognized 
if the fair value is lower than the book value  a second step must be performed 
the second step is to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  and requires that a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
this fair value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value is lower than the carrying value  an impairment must be recorded
