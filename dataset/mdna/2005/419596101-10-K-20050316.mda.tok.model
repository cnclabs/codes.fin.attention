such statements speak only as of the date they are made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of future events  new information or otherwise 
the following are some of the factors that could cause havertys actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward looking statements the ability to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with key suppliers including domestic and international sourcing  any disruptions in the 
flow of imported merchandise  whether caused by war  strikes  tariff  politics or otherwise  conditions affecting the availability and affordability of retail and distribution real estate sites  the ability to attract  train and retain highly qualified associates to staff existing and new stores  distribution facilities and corporate positions  general economic and

table of contents overview we focus on several key metrics in managing and evaluating our operating performance and financial condition including the following comparable store sales  sales by merchandise categories  gross profit  operating costs as a percentage of sales  cash flow  total debt to total capital  and earnings per share 
our sales are generated by customer purchases of home furnishings in our retail stores and recorded as revenue when delivered to the customer 
there is typically a two week lag between the time when a customer s order is placed in one of our stores and the time when the customer is able to arrange their schedule for delivery 
comparable store or comp store sales are comparisons of sales results of stores that have been open at least one year 
as a retailer  this performance measure is an indicator of relative customer spending period over period 
havertys cost of sales includes only the costs associated with the sourcing of our products 
our gross profit is primarily dependent upon merchandising capabilities  vendor pricing and the mix of products sold 
the success of our havertys brands has continued since their introduction at the end of and these products have been expanded as a percentage of our overall sales mix 
the introduction of havertys premium collections and our bedding line during were important steps in establishing the havertys brand in all product categories 
we view the sourcing of the values associated with imported product offerings and the mix of our merchandise as important opportunities for improving our performance 
our operational focus during the past few years has been our warehouse and delivery effectiveness as we completely revamped our distribution methodology and consolidated certain customer service functions 
this created redundant operations and increased inventory markdowns during the transition periods in the affected markets 
we are continuing the transformation and consolidation of our distribution systems which are scheduled for completion by the second quarter of the growing percentage of imported products from asia and the increased havertys brands merchandise are significant changes in our industry and our business within a very short time frame 
the longer lead times required for delivery from the factories and the production of merchandise exclusively for havertys have been analyzed by our supply chain team 
we plan to expand the storage capacity of our eastern dc to store imported goods for our eastern growth and moves into the midwest 
additionally  it will help us supplement the product flow from key domestic upholstery suppliers for the florida region 
we are continuing our initiative to begin a direct importing program  with a focus on china and asia 
our main strategy is to work with the largest and most experienced manufacturers and to become important customers to these suppliers 
we realize that there are increased risks in direct importing and therefore we are moving at a deliberate and measured pace 
cash flows continued to be strong during  providing funding for million in new property and equipment expenditures  million in purchases of assets that were previously leased  and the reduction of long term debt by million 
our cash flow accelerated during and in part due to the outsourcing of certain credit promotions to a third party finance company  and those programs have now reached a fairly level state 
the increased cash enabled us to repay all of our fixed rate debt that did not have significant pre payment penalties 
our total debt to total capital was at december   continuing the improvement compared to prior years 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts using a method that considers the balances in problem and delinquent categories of accounts  historical write offs and judgment 
delinquent accounts are generally written off automatically after the passage of nine months without 
table of contents receiving a full scheduled monthly payment 
accounts are written off sooner in the event of a discharged bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collections unlikely 
we assess the adequacy of the allowance at the end of each quarter 
while our customer base is large and geographically dispersed  a general economic downturn affecting our target customers could result in higher than expected defaults  and therefore the need to revise estimates for bad debts 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded provisions for bad debts of million  million and million  respectively 
the amount of the provision has dropped as the levels of in house receivables have decreased and collection experience has improved 
reserve for cancelled sales and allowances 
as part of the normal sales cycle and our focus on customer service and satisfaction  we have customer merchandise returns and make allowances to customers 
a reserve for merchandise returns and customer allowances is estimated based on the company s historical returns and allowance experience and current sales levels 
we periodically evaluate the reserve by comparing the assumptions used in our estimate to the actual returns and allowances made 
our reserve for cancelled sales and allowances totalled  and  at december  and  respectively 
our experience with cancelled sales and allowances has improved in connection with our enhanced  centralized customer service processes 
facility closing costs 
we periodically evaluate the operations of each of our retail and warehouse locations 
this also has been an important part of our transition to our new distribution methods 
in the period we close a store or warehouse  we record as an obligation the present value of estimated costs that will not be recovered 
these costs include any estimated loss on the sale of the land and buildings  the book value of any abandoned leasehold improvements and amounts for future lease payments  less any estimated sublease income 
prior to january   we recorded these estimated costs at the time we committed to a store or warehouse closure 
at december  and  our reserve for facility closing costs totalled  and  respectively 
in the future  our facility closing costs could increase or decrease based upon the fair market value of owned properties  our ability to sublease facilities and the accuracy of our related estimates 
consideration received from vendors 
we have varying agreements with many of our vendors that provide for advertising allowances or rebates 
we adopted the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
accounting by a customer for cash consideration received from a vendor eitf  effective january  we had historically treated cooperative advertising allowances and vendor rebates as a reduction of advertising expense 
eitf requires vendor rebates to be treated as a reduction of inventory costs for agreements entered into or significantly modified after december  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our financial statements because we had agreements in place prior to the effective date or we identified and tracked specific incremental advertising costs that were vendor specific which qualify for expense offset 
based on the administrative costs associated with tracking and matching allowances to vendor specific advertising costs  we classified all vendor consideration as a reduction of inventory costs during gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses both reported increases from their historical basis as vendor consideration generated a reduction in cost of sales rather than being recorded as an offset to advertising expense 
pension and retirement benefits 
pension and other retirement plans costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates  investment returns  projected salary increases and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used in the company s pension and retirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for the company s future pension and retirement benefit obligations 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  
table of contents differences between assumed and actual experience may affect the company s operating results 
a one percent change in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact expense for the defined benefit pension plan by approximately million  a change 
a one percent change in the expected return on plan assets would impact expense for the defined benefit pension plan by approximately million  a change 
in addition  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements 
self insurance 
we are self insured for certain losses related to worker s compensation  general liability and automobile claims 
our reserve is developed based on historical claims data and contains an actuarially developed incurred but not reported component 
the resulting estimate is discounted and recorded as a liability 
our actuarial assumptions and discount rates are reviewed periodically and compared with actual claims experience and external benchmarks to ensure that our methodology and assumptions are appropriate 
operating results the following table sets forth for the periods indicated i selected statement of income data  expressed as a percentage of net sales and ii the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year in selected statement of income data percentage change in dollars percentage of net sales from prior year net sales cost of sales gross profit credit service charge revenue provision for doubtful accounts selling  general and administrative expenses income before income taxes net income cost of sales  on a comparable basis gross profit  on a comparable basis selling  general and administrative expenses  on a comparable basis cost of sales  gross profit and sg a expenses in and have been adjusted from the amounts reported in our financial statements 
the amounts for and have been adjusted by million and million  respectively  for the treatment of vendor rebates and advertising allowances so that they are comparable to the treatment in we believe this non gaap presentation is meaningful because without presenting and on a comparable basis to  our gross profit would appear to have increased significantly as compared to and conversely  sg a costs would appear to have increased significantly in versus and however  on a gaap basis these changes are primarily due to the required classification of vendor rebates and allowances as a reduction of inventory costs and a resulting reduction in cost of sales in  whereas in prior years such amounts were included as a reduction of sg a costs 
excluding the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended december  
table of contents net sales total sales increased million or and million or in and  respectively 
comparable store sales rose or million in and or million in the remaining million and million of the increases in and  respectively  were from new and otherwise non comparable stores  partially offset by the loss of sales from stores closed 
stores are considered non comparable if open for less than one year or if the selling square footage has been changed significantly during the past months 
large clearance sales events from warehouses or temporary locations are also excluded from comparable store sales  as are periods when stores are closed or being remodeled 
the following outlines our sales and comp store sales increases for the periods indicated dollars in millions year ended december  comp store comp store comp store net sales sales net sales sales net sales sales increase increase increase increase increase increase decrease decrease decrease decrease decrease decrease period dollars over prior over prior dollars over prior over prior dollars over prior over prior ended s period period s period period s period period q q q q year retail sales of big ticket home goods were weak from mid to mid  which was widely reported to be due to consumer anxiety about employment uncertainty  threats of war  war and geopolitical unrest 
there was also a lingering negative effect from lower stock market values  beginning in june we had positive comp store monthly sales results that continued throughout the remainder of and through april excluding november  which was negative 
sales in our florida and southeast markets during august and september of were negatively impacted by record breaking severe weather from four hurricanes within a six week period 
these lost sales were particularly significant because our florida stores normally produce approximately of our total sales 
we do expect that the storm damage will generate some incremental sales through august of as damaged furniture is replaced and from associated redecorating activity 
during october  we experienced some delays in receiving product from asia and began building a backlog of undelivered orders faster than our historical rates 
the backlog remained higher than the prior year s level at year end as strong sales activity during november and december kept the order rate ahead of our deliveries 
we believe that continued strong housing sales and low interest rates are a positive factor for the industry  but consumer confidence and further indications of a strengthening economy are key to increased spending for big ticket furniture items 
many retailers have been advertising aggressive sales promotions to stimulate business and increase their sales volume 
we believe that this approach would negatively impact our everyday low pricing integrity with our customers over the longer term 
we have instead used some promotional pricing during traditional sales events 
supplementing the pricing promotions  we also offer 
table of contents free interest and deferred payment financing promotions 
we expect to continue this approach of providing a selection of specially priced merchandise and financing promotions to increase traffic in our stores 
our sales during increased across all major categories of furnishings  with recliners and sleeper sofas  bedding and upholstery performing better than the average 
our average sales transaction and price per item both remained modestly higher over the prior year periods 
net sales for each period by category were as follows in millions year ended december  of net of net of net net sales sales net sales sales net sales sales upholstery bedroom formal dining casual dining recliners and sleeper sofas occasional total furniture sales bedding sales accessories and other net sales havertys private label brands gross profit cost of sales consists primarily of the purchase price of the merchandise together with freight costs and the sourcing costs of our products 
our gross profit is largely dependent upon merchandising capabilities  vendor pricing and the mix of products sold 
we have developed strong relationships with our suppliers and believe that we receive excellent pricing and superior service from our key vendors in exchange for distribution of their products 
the continued improvements related to the products imported from asia and pricing pressure on domestic suppliers have also generated good values for us 
many retailers have used the decreased costs to support their heavy promotional pricing 
our approach has been to offer products with greater value at our established middle to upper middle price points 
gross profit  on a comparable basis  was  a basis points decline from the gross profit in  and a basis points improvement over the gross profit in gross profit  on a comparable basis  was negatively impacted by approximately basis points during by an increase in the lifo reserve 
we also had a higher level of inventory markdowns during as we closed and consolidated warehouses 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  as some of our competitors struggled and aggressively offered heavy discounts  we were compelled to match prices on identical or similar products in several of our markets 
our havertys private label merchandise produced modestly higher gross margins compared to the other products we offered and havertys brands margins increased on a year over year basis 
we have gradually increased the number of havertys private label items in our merchandise mix since its introduction in sales of these private label lines as a percent of total sales have grown to in from in and from in  with steady increases to nearly in december 
table of contents during much of our focus was to seek values with imported product offerings and to explore how we might better source and flow those goods 
our core furniture merchandise comprises approximately of the furniture items  excluding bedding and accessories  which we carry in all of our stores 
additional products that are more regionally focused and items needed to merchandise our larger retail stores supplement the core furniture merchandise assortment 
imported products comprised approximately of our core merchandise groups at december   and increased to approximately by the end of as new products were received and displayed in our showrooms 
wood products  or case goods  are generally imported  with only of our selected case goods at december   produced domestically 
upholstered items are not as heavily imported  with the exception of our leather products  of which almost were imported during the havertys private label lines are approximately imported with virtually all case goods and leather items being imported 
we believe for the selected imported items we purchase  we achieve substantial savings as compared to domestically produced similar products 
we are exploring additional ways to increase our gross profit including working directly with foreign manufacturers 
we believe that  although there are savings in the direct import approach to sourcing our goods  there are also associated risks with quality and customer acceptance 
our merchandising team has selected an experienced quality control firm that will be dedicated to inspecting product produced for havertys 
we are also using a design firm to complement our merchandising team s skills to develop our havertys private label products 
similar to our careful introduction of the first havertys branded products  we will move judiciously on a direct import program 
an anti dumping petition against chinese furniture makers for allegedly dumping wooden bedroom furniture was filed during this created some disruption in the industry and in our flow of product as manufacturers shifted production to other countries in preparation for unfavorable duties 
the actual duties determined by the department of commerce were announced late in and are not significant for the manufacturers that produce our merchandise 
the selected vendors that provide us with their branded goods remain important suppliers to us 
their products have wide customer acceptance and we are also working with several of these manufacturers developing product that carries their brand but will be exclusive to havertys 
we believe that the combination of these types of arrangements and our havertys private label products will provide our customers with an excellent selection of merchandise at attractive prices and yield improving margins for havertys 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are comprised of five categories selling  occupancy  warehouse and delivery  administrative  and advertising 
selling expenses primarily are comprised of compensation of sales associates and sales support staff  and fees paid to credit card and third party finance companies 
occupancy costs include rents  depreciation charges  insurance and property taxes  repairs and maintenance expenses and utility costs 
warehouse and delivery costs include personnel  fuel costs  and depreciation and rental charges for equipment and rolling stock 
administrative expenses are comprised of compensation costs for store management  information systems  executive  finance  merchandising  real estate and human resource departments as well as retirement costs for all havertys employees 
advertising expenses are primarily media production and space  direct mail costs  market research expenses and employee compensation 
our sg a costs were negatively impacted by several factors in total sg a costs  as a percentage of net sales were for as compared to and  on a comparable basis  in and  respectively 

table of contents selling expenses increased in over mainly due to our customers increased use of credit cards when purchasing and accordingly our bank card fees have risen 
the increase in over was primarily from the charges associated with more usage of the credit programs that we outsource to a third party 
we believe that the amounts we pay for the outsourced credit program are justified compared to the increased costs associated with a larger receivables portfolio and the collection risks of the more promotional credit offers needed to remain competitive 
we have been developing our distribution and store systems to accommodate store expansion and sales growth 
the increased warehouse and delivery expense including facility closing and start up costs associated with the distribution transition were approximately million in the fourth quarter of the transition costs also contributed to greater expense in as compared to total occupancy costs have increased over the three year period as we have increased our retail square footage and added or replaced stores 
the occupancy costs as a percentage of sales remained relatively flat in  and we increased our advertising dollars during as we continued to build our havertys brand image with our target customers 
our costs associated with television advertising increased over from to as we used this media form in our larger and new markets 
total advertising costs without vendor rebates and allowances as a percentage of sales were  and for  and  respectively 
administrative expenses increased in due to the following additional costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  installation and conversion to our new accounting software package  costs associated with the research and analysis of prospective new real estate markets and locations  increased state payroll tax rates and increases in our group insurance premiums 
the increased administrative expenses in as compared to were due in part to increases in property and casualty insurance premiums and group insurance costs 
credit service charge revenue and allowance for doubtful accounts our credit service charge revenue has continued to decline as customers choose credit promotions with no interest features 
the in house financing program most frequently chosen by our customers is a month  no interest and equal payments promotion which generates very minor credit revenue  but helps us reduce our interest expense and bad debts due to the faster payout relative to our other in house credit programs 
the standard outsourced programs offer deferred payment for days  or for larger purchases  for to months  with an interest accrual that is waived if the entire balance is paid in full at the end of the deferral period 
the to months deferred payment promotions are the most popular of all the credit programs offered through the third party finance company and are also used more than any program offered by havertys credit 

table of contents the following highlights the impact these changes have had on our credit service charge revenue and related accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts dollars in thousands year ended december  credit service charge revenue amount financed as a of sales havertys third party financed by havertys no interest for months no interest for months no interest for months other year ended december  accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts allowance as a of accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts has declined during the three year period as lower levels of inhouse receivables were generated 
our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of the receivables pool is lower at the end of due to improvements in the delinquency and problem category percentages from and interest expense interest expense declined in from the level  and was a significant decline from average debt decreased in and in these reductions were partly offset by an increase in our effective interest rate of basis points in compared to  as most of the debt reduction was in lower cost  floating rate borrowings 
other income expense 
other income expense is primarily related to real estate 
we have had dispositions of warehouses as we transition our distribution methodology to various markets 
during  we had gains from the sale of a regional warehouse and other properties of million 
during  we had gains of million from the sale of two local market warehouses and other retail properties and million from the early termination of a lease by the landlord 
we sold one market area warehouse and two of our larger regional warehouses during as part of the real estate gains of million

recent accounting pronouncements stock based compensation 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt statement r on july  as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend upon  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amounts of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were   and  in  and  respectively 
the company began a transition to the use of restricted stock grants in lieu of stock options in in its long term incentive compensation strategy 
earnings per share 
effective for the quarter ended june   the company began reporting its earnings per share using the two class method as required by the emerging issues task force eitf 
the eitf reached final consensus on issue no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share sfas  at their march  meeting 
eitf requires the income per share for each class of common stock to be calculated assuming of the company s earnings are distributed as dividends to each class of common stock based on their contractual rights 
the effective result of eitf is that the basic earnings per share for the common stock is approximately of the basic earnings per share of the class a common stock 
additionally  given the company s current capital structure  diluted earnings per share for common stock under eitf is the same as was previously reported for diluted earnings per share using the if converted method 

table of contents cash consideration received from vendor 
in november  the eitf issued eitf  accounting by a customer for cash consideration received from a vendor 
this eitf places certain restrictions on the treatment of advertising allowances and generally requires vendor consideration to be treated as a reduction of inventory costs for agreements entered into or significantly modified after november   with certain limited exceptions 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements as most contracts were in place prior to the effective date or allowances were tracked and identified with specific incremental advertising costs 
the company reclassified approximately  of allowances and rebates out of advertising and into cost of sales during 
based on the administrative costs to track and match allowances to vendor specific advertising costs  all vendor consideration received during was recorded as a reduction in inventory costs 
the adoption of this eitf  although not materially impacting our financial performance  makes the key metrics of gross profit and sg a not on a comparable basis for the periods prior to variable interest entities 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the interpretation requires the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
previously  entities were generally consolidated by an enterprise that has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
during  we concluded that we were the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie that is the lessor under an operating lease of our dallas distribution center and its attached retail space and three retail locations 
effective december   the company consolidated the vie and recorded a cumulative effect of an accounting change of million net of income tax expense of million  or per diluted common share 
consolidation of the vie increased property and equipment by million  accumulated depreciation by million  long term borrowings by million and created a minority interest of 
million 
liquidity and capital resources the following sections discuss the sources of our cash flows and commitments which impact our liquidity and capital resources on both a short term and long term basis 
cash decreased million in and increased million in cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity 
cash provided by operations was million in compared to million in the decrease in was due in part to a lesser impact from the outsourced credit programs which we believe have reached a level rate  and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million 
inventory also increased in as the amount of our imported products has increased 
cash flows used in investing activities was million in as compared to million in  investing activities in and were primarily for capital expenditures and purchases of properties previously under leases 
we sold several properties as part of the warehouse consolidation process and had total real estate proceeds of million in and million in see store expansion and capital expenditures for further discussion of past and expected outflows 
additionally  we invested a portion of our excess cash in auction rate securities and had million remaining at december  
table of contents cash flows used in financing activities was million in as compared to million in cash flows in both years were used to repay long term debt and in to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
we used our revolving credit facilities on a very limited basis during and partially to fund capital expenditures during early financings we have revolving lines of credit available for general corporate purposes and as interim financing for capital expenditures 
these credit facilities are syndicated with six commercial banks and comprised of two revolving lines totaling million that terminate in september borrowings under these facilities are unsecured and accrue interest at libor plus a spread that is based on a fixed charge coverage ratio 
we had letters of credit in the amount of million outstanding at december   and these amounts are considered part of the facilities usage 
our unused capacity was million at december  we reviewed all of our fixed rate long term debt in and repaid those facilities that did not include significant prepayment penalties or other issues that would make accelerating the payments problematic 
we pursue a diversified approach to our financing requirements and generally balance our fixed rate and capped rate debt as determined by the interest rate environment 
our overall debt capital structure at december   was approximately unsecured and with fixed rates of interest 
our debt reduction has caused variable rate debt levels to move below typical levels 
the average effective interest rate on all borrowings excluding capital leases and the vie debt was at december  our long term debt to total capital ratio was at december   including the vie debt 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands less than after total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases scheduled interest on long term debt other liabilities purchase obligations total contractual obligations store expansion and capital expenditures we have entered several new markets and made continued improvements and relocations of our store base 
our total selling square footage has increased an average of approximately annually over the past years 
during  we opened the second largest amount of square footage in our history  opening eight new stores and three larger relocated stores 
the following outlines the changes in our selling square footage for the three years ended december  square footage in thousands 
table of contents of square of square of square stores footage stores footage stores footage stores opened stores closed year end balances we are expecting to add approximately retail square footage during as we open a new store in the new markets of indianapolis  indiana  ft 
lauderdale  florida  and columbus  ohio 
we also plan to add a store in the metro dc area and replace two existing locations with a new store in shreveport  louisiana 
we plan to open approximately six stores in these include a location near stonecrest mall  east of atlanta  a relocated store in south dallas in the cedar hill area  a new store in boca raton  florida and three additional stores in florida 
we are aggressively evaluating other possible new locations which we believe will become available in existing retail sites in the near term 
our strategy is to pursue opportunities in denser markets which we can serve using our existing distribution 
our investing activities in stores and operations in and and planned outlays for are categorized in the table below 
capital expenditures for stores in the years noted do not necessarily coincide with the years in which the stores open 
we have made purchases of properties that were previously recorded as capital leases on our balance sheet or as operating leases and have shown those amounts in this table 
proposed in thousands stores new stores remodels expansions maintenance total stores distribution information technology total capital expenditures for new property and equipment purchases of assets in operations previously under lease total we will be disposing of warehouses and land during and proceeds from these sales are estimated to be approximately million 
cash balances  funds from operations  proceeds from sales of properties and bank lines of credit are expected to be adequate to finance our capital expenditures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential joss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 

table of contents in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risks  including fluctuations in interest rates 
to manage the exposure related to this risk  we may use various derivative transactions 
as a matter of policy  we do not engage in derivatives trading or other speculative activities 
moreover  we enter into financial instruments transactions with either major financial institutions or high credit rated counter parties  thereby limited exposure to credit and performance related risks 
we have exposure to floating interest rates through certain of our borrowings 
therefore  interest expense will fluctuate with changes in libor and other benchmark rates 
at december   we had two interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million at rates between and and maturing september  we do not believe a basis point change in interest rates would have a significant adverse impact on our operating results or financial position
