item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent accounting pronouncements for additional information with regard to recent accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have a lengthy sales cycle  which increases the likelihood that our quarterly net sales will fluctuate and which may  in turn  adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
due to the complexity of our technology  our customers perform  and require us to perform  extensive process and product evaluation and testing  which results in a lengthy sales cycle 
our sales cycles often last for several months  and may last for up to a year or more 
as a result of this lengthy sales cycle  our net sales 
table of contents and operating results may vary unpredictably from period to period 
this fact makes it more difficult to forecast our quarterly results and can cause substantial variations in operating results from quarter to quarter that are unrelated to the long term trends in our business 
this lack of predictability and variability in our results could adversely affect the market price of our common stock in particular periods 
our failure to detect unknown defects in our products could materially harm our relationship with customers  our reputation and our business 
notwithstanding the testing that we perform on our products  defects could be found in our existing or new products 
these defects could result in product liability or warranty claims 
in addition  any defects found in our products could result in a loss of net sales or market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  injury to our reputation  indemnification claims  litigation  increased insurance costs and increased service costs  any of which could discourage customers from purchasing our products 
although we maintain a warranty reserve  we cannot be certain that this reserve will be sufficient to cover our warranty or other expenses that could arise in the future as a result of defects found in our products 
our operating results could be seriously harmed if the markets in which we sell our products do not grow 
our continued success depends in large part on the continued growth of various market sectors that use our products  including the following defense and aerospace equipment  computers and computer related peripherals  medical electronics and equipment  home appliances and consumer electronics  industrial controls  and telecommunication datacommunication equipment 
approximately of our product sales for fiscal year and of our product sales for fiscal year were incorporated into data communication end products 
the telecommunications industry is making a gradual recovery  and we believe this recovery will be slow as companies gradually use up their excess network capacity 
slower growth in the other markets in which we sell our products could reduce our sales  adversely affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  decreases in demand in the consumer electronics and home appliance markets  could negatively impact our sales and profits for our subsidiary  ids 
further downturns in the industries in which we operate could reduce the value of our inventories and cause a reduction in our profits 
in the past  we have experienced reductions in the value of our inventories due to unexpected demand declines  resulting from a softening of the semiconductor and telecommunications industries 
such declines have caused us to write down several million dollars worth of inventory  which greatly reduced our profits for the given period 
in  for example  we reserved approximately million in excess inventory 
if any of the markets in which our customers operate suffers a decline  we may be forced to write down existing inventory  which could adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents we utilize manufacturing resources in asia and mexico  which limits our control of the manufacturing process 
as part of our strategy to decrease manufacturing costs  we outsource some of our manufacturing requirements to strategic partners in taiwan  china  the philippines and mexico 
outsourcing  particularly with international manufacturers  carries certain risks  including the outsourcing contractors ability to manufacture products that meet our technical specifications and that have minimal defects  the outsourcing contractors ability to honor their product warranties  the financial solvency  labor concerns and general business condition of our outsourcing contractors  unexpected changes in and the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulatory requirements  increased chances of our intellectual property being infringed as a result of the failure of foreign governments to enforce the protection of intellectual property rights  political and economic instability in overseas locations  and global health related matters  such as another sars scare  avian flu and other factors 
we are dependent on international markets for a large portion of our purchases and sales 
foreign suppliers of semiconductor and display related materials are regularly threatened with  or involved in  pending trade disputes and sanctions 
for example  during the period between and  we were forced to pay high tariffs to import various semiconductor parts from taiwan 
if trade disputes or sanctions arise that affect our suppliers  we may be unable to obtain access to critical sources of raw materials that we need to produce our products  in which event our business could be adversely affected 
we anticipate that our foreign sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
foreign sales accounted for approximately and of our overall sales for fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
approximately million of our fiscal year sales were to prime military contractors  and if the united states government placed restrictions on exporting military technology using our products in countries where we have customers  or vendors  it could cause a significant reduction in our sales and profits 
our foreign sales are subject to the following risks fluctuations in foreign currencies  which may adversely affect the prices of our products and the prices of raw materials used in our products  trade disputes  changes in regulatory requirements  license requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  the possibility of quotas  duties  taxes or other changes or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of our products implemented by the united states government or foreign governments  the timing and availability of export or other licenses  general political and economic conditions in the countries in which we sell our products  language and other cultural differences which may inhibit our sales and marketing efforts  costs of complying with a variety of foreign laws  difficulty of accounts receivable collections  increased chances of our intellectual property being infringed as a result of the failure of foreign governments to enforce the protection of intellectual property rights  and public health issues that could disrupt local economies 

table of contents if we are unable to retain employees with key technical expertise or we are otherwise unable to protect our intellectual property  or if we are found to have infringed third party intellectual property rights  our financial condition and future prospects could be materially harmed 
the products that we sell from both our microelectronic segment and our display segment require a large amount of engineering design and manufacturing expertise 
however  the majority of our technological capabilities are not protected by patents and licenses 
we rely on the expertise of our employees  and our learned experiences in both the design and manufacture of our products 
if we were to lose one or more of our key employees  then we would likely lose some portion of our institutional knowledge and technical know how 
it is possible  and it has occurred in the past  that a competitor may also learn to design and produce products with similar performance abilities as our products 
if a competitor were to do so  it may result in increased competition  and a reduction of sales for our products 
we rely on trade secret protection for most of our proprietary technology  in part through confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and third parties 
if any of these agreements are found to be unenforceable  we may be unable to adequately protect our technology 
if any of these agreements are breached  especially by companies much larger than us  we may not have adequate financial resources to adequately enforce our rights 
also  others may come to know about or determine our trade secrets 
in addition  the laws of certain territories in which we develop  manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
while we are currently not aware of any claims against us for the infringement of intellectual property rights  any such claim could divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and require us to spend significant resources to develop or otherwise obtain non infringing technology 
any successful claim against us would likely require us to pay substantial damages or cease the use and sale of infringing products  or both 
our business is dependent upon retaining key personnel and attracting new employees 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of hamid r 
shokrgozar  our chief executive officer  and other senior management and key personnel 
the loss of the services of mr 
shokrgozar or any of our senior management or key personnel could adversely affect our business 
we may not be able to retain these employees and searching for their replacements could divert the attention of other senior management and increase our operating expenses 
of our current executive officers  only mr 
shokrgozar has an employment contract with us 
we currently do not maintain any key person life insurance 
to manage our operations effectively  we may need to hire and retain additional qualified employees including in the areas of product design  engineering  operations management  manufacturing production  sales  accounting and finance 
we may have difficulty recruiting these employees or integrating them into our business 
our failure to comply with environmental regulations could subject us to costs and production delays 
we currently use limited quantities of hazardous materials common to our industry in connection with the production of our products 
we must follow federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding the handling  storage and disposal of these materials 
to our knowledge  we are currently in material compliance with all federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding the handling  use  storage and disposal of these materials 
we could be subject to fines  suspensions of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or interruption or cessation of our operations if we fail to comply with present or future laws or regulations related to the use  storage  handling  discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
these regulations could require us to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur other expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
our failure to control the handling  use  storage or disposal of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances could subject us to liabilities and production delays  which could cause us to miss our customer s delivery schedules  thereby reducing our sales for a given period 
we may also have to pay 
table of contents regulatory fines  penalties or other costs including remediation costs  which could materially reduce our profits 
if our selling prices decline and we fail to reduce our costs  our sales and operating results will decline 
even in the absence of cyclical conditions  the average selling prices of our products have historically decreased during the products lives  and we expect this trend to continue  especially with respect to sales in the commercial markets 
in order to offset these average selling price decreases  we attempt to decrease manufacturing costs  and introduce new  higher priced products that incorporate advanced features 
if these efforts are not successful  we will not be competitive because we will not be able to remain profitable at decreased selling prices  possibly leading to our exit from certain market sectors 
in addition to following the general pattern of decreasing average selling prices  the selling prices for certain products  particularly random access memory ram  dynamic random access memory dram  or sram products and liquid crystal displays  fluctuate significantly with real and perceived changes in the balance of supply and demand for these products 
if we are unable to decrease per unit manufacturing costs faster than the rate at which average selling prices continue to decline  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be seriously harmed 
in addition  we expect our competitors to invest in new manufacturing capacity and achieve significant manufacturing yield improvements in the future 
these developments could result in a dramatic increase in worldwide supply and result in associated downward pressure on prices 
if we fail to develop  introduce and sell new products or fail to develop and implement new manufacturing technologies  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we operate in a highly competitive  quickly changing environment marked by rapid obsolescence of existing products 
the future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  make required capital investments  design  develop  manufacture  market and sell services and products that meet our customers changing needs  and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
our sales will be reduced  either through loss of business to our competitors or discontinuance of our products in the market  if any of the following occur we fail to complete and introduce new product designs in a timely manner  we are unable to design and manufacture products according to the requirements of our customers  our customers do not successfully introduce new systems or products incorporating our products  market demand for our new products does not develop as anticipated  we are unable to obtain raw materials in a timely manner or at favorable prices  or we are unable to maintain pricing to sustain or grow our gross margins 
in particular  many of our display products have been developed based on products procured from sharp electronics corporation 
our competitors in the enhanced display products market are investing substantial resources to develop flat panel displays using alternative technologies 
if our competitors are successful in developing new products that offer significant advantages over our products  and we are unable to improve our technology or develop or acquire alternative technology that is more competitive  we will lose business to our competitors and our sales and profits from the display segment will be greatly reduced 
increasing complexity in our microelectronic segment generally requires the use of smaller geometries in semiconductor chips 
this makes manufacturing new generations of products substantially more difficult and costly than prior products 
ultimately  whether we can successfully introduce these and other new products depends on our ability to develop and implement new ways of manufacturing our products 
if we are unable to design  develop  manufacture  market and sell new products successfully  we will lose business and possibly be forced to exit from the particular market or sector 

table of contents we depend on limited suppliers for certain critical raw materials 
our inability to obtain sufficient raw materials at favorable prices could increase our prices or otherwise harm our business 
our manufacturing operations require raw materials that must meet exacting standards 
the most significant raw materials that we purchase are memory devices in wafer  die  and component forms and amlcd panels 
shortages of wafers and other raw materials may occur when there is a strong demand for memory integrated circuits and other related products 
amlcd panels may also be in short supply at times 
we rely heavily on our ability to maintain access to steady sources of these raw materials at favorable prices 
we are highly dependent on one or two semiconductor manufacturers for memory devices  such as sram  sdram  double data rate ddr  flash  etc 
and one package manufacturer of ceramic packages for military components 
we do not have specific long term contractual arrangements with our suppliers but we believe we are on good terms with our suppliers 
we cannot be certain that we will continue to have access to our current sources of supply or that we will not encounter supply problems in the future 
any interruption in our supply of raw materials could reduce our sales in a given period  and possibly cause a loss of business to a competitor  if we could not reschedule the deliveries of our product to our customers 
in addition  our gross profits could suffer if the prices for raw materials increase  especially with respect to sales associated with military contracts where prices are typically fixed 
united states and global responses to terrorism  the middle east situation and perceived nuclear threats increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
united states and global responses to terrorism  the middle east situation and perceived nuclear threats from north korea and others increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets 
several factors associated  directly or indirectly  with terrorism  the iraq situation and perceived nuclear threats and responses may adversely affect us 
various us government responses to these factors could realign government programs and affect the composition  funding or timing of the government programs in which we participate 
government spending could shift to programs in which we may not participate or may not have current capabilities 
the influence of any of these factors  which are largely beyond our control  could adversely affect our business 
while we believe our control systems are effective  there are inherent limitations in all control systems  and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls  disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
in addition  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
further  controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more persons  or by management override of the controls 
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
because of inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

table of contents our board of directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock that could have rights superior to our outstanding shares of common stock  and  if issued  could adversely impact the value of our common stock 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation permit our board of directors  in its sole discretion  to issue up to  shares of authorized but unissued preferred stock 
these shares may be issued by our board of directors  without further action by our shareholders  and may include any of the following rights  among others  which may be superior to the rights of our outstanding common stock voting rights  including the right to vote as a class on particular matters  preferences as to dividends and liquidation rights  conversion rights and anti dilution protections  and redemption rights 
since our board of directors has the authority to determine  from time to time  the terms of our authorized preferred stock  there is no limit on the amount of common stock that could be issuable upon conversion of any future series of preferred stock that may be issued 
the rights of holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in addition  the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the issuance of any series of preferred stock with voting or other rights superior to those of our common stock 
the issuance of any series of preferred stock could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock 
our shareholders rights plan may make it more difficult for others to obtain control of us 
pursuant to the terms of our shareholders rights plan  we have distributed a dividend of one right for each outstanding share of common stock 
these rights will cause substantial dilution to the ownership of a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors  and may have the effect of deterring hostile takeover attempts 
the practical effect of these provisions is to require a party seeking control of us to negotiate with our board of directors  which could delay or prevent a change in control 
these provisions could discourage a future takeover attempt which individual shareholders might deem to be in their best interests or in which shareholders would receive a premium for their shares over current prices 
our stock price has been volatile 
the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to future announcements concerning our company  our competitors or our principal customers  such as quarterly operating results  adjustments to previously reported results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  technological innovations  new product introductions  governmental regulations  or litigation  the liquidity within the market of our common stock  sales of common stock by our officers  directors and other insiders  investor perceptions concerning the prospects of our business  market conditions and investor sentiment affecting market prices of equity securities of high technology companies in the microelectronic or display industries  general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions or international currency fluctuations  market reaction to acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors  and lawsuits filed against the company

overview we design  develop and manufacture innovative microelectronic and display components and systems for inclusion in high technology products used in the military  industrial  and commercial markets 
our microelectronic solutions include advanced semiconductor and state of the art multi chip packaging  as well as our proprietary process for applying anti tamper protection to mission critical semiconductor components in military applications 
our display solutions include enhanced flat panel display products  interface devices and 
table of contents electromechanical assemblies 
our customers  which include military prime contractors in the united states and europe as well as commercial oems  outsource many of their microelectronic and display components and systems to us as a result of the combination of our design  development and manufacturing expertise 
we were formed as a result of the merger between bowmar and edi in october at the time of the merger  bowmar was a manufacturer of high reliability electronic components and interface and mechanical devices  mainly for military applications 
edi was a manufacturer of commercial memory products for the telecommunications and networking markets and also had a small ruggedized display business serving the military and industrial markets 
this merger provided us with a diversified platform to expand our product offerings within both the military and commercial markets 
in order to complement our military industrial display business  we acquired panelview  a designer and manufacturer of enhanced commercial flat panel display products  in january following the acquisition  we consolidated our display operations into our panelview subsidiary 
in january  we acquired ids  a designer and manufacturer of membrane keypads  flexible circuits  sensors  control panels  and handheld and desktop electronic devices 
this acquisition allowed us to expand our interface device product offerings and enhance our subsystem solutions 
in addition  with ids design and manufacturing capabilities we can now offer fully integrated system level solutions 
executive summary net sales for the fiscal year ended october  were approximately million  compared to net sales of million for fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to increases in both the microelectronic and the display segments 
microelectronic segment sales to the military industrial customers  which had trailed fiscal sales for the first half of fiscal  finished strong in the fourth quarter and increased annual sales by over fiscal commercial sales in the microelectronic segment grew primarily due to the increase in sales to a customer for their hotel entertainment delivery systems 
military industrial display segment net sales fell due to an overall decrease in order activity 
the increase in commercial display segment net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales to ncr corporation and for tablet personal computer products 
we continue to see the benefits of our investment in the development of circuit complexity management  interface communications and display enhancements in the display segment 
however  we made a strategic business decision in our display segment not to pursue future business in low margin products 
in connection with this decision  our contract with ncr corporation ended in our fiscal fourth quarter 
a key indicator of our future sales is the amount of new orders received compared to current net sales  known as the book to bill ratio 
for the year  we had new orders of approximately million  which equates to a book to bill ratio of for the year 
microelectronic segment orders for the year were approximately million  which equates to a book to bill ratio of for the year 
military industrial bookings were strong again for the third quarter in a row 
however  we do not have a level of visibility that indicates to us that this trend will continue in the coming quarters 
display segment orders for the year were approximately million  which equates to a book to bill ratio of for the year 
as a result of our strategic decision to not pursue lower margin sales and the resulting completion of the ncr contract  we expect display segment bookings to be down in fiscal new orders for our microelectronic segment s anti tamper process technology were approximately million for the year and we had sales of approximately million 
we currently expect to see growth for anti tamper technology products over the next several years 
our gross margins increased year over year to approximately for fiscal from approximately for fiscal the primary reason for this increase was higher margins in our microelectronic segment  which increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the reason for the increase was due to a higher percentage of military sales  which traditionally carry larger margins over commercial sales  as well as the product mix within military industrial sales 
display segment gross margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal gross margins for our display segment products continue to come under pressure from both domestic and asian competition  and while we are implementing business and manufacturing strategies to improve our competitive position  it may be difficult to continue to maintain current gross margins in the future 

table of contents our overall production has  at times  been affected by longer lead times for certain components  which may affect the timing and cost of sales during the year 
the availability and price of memory components  based on supply and demand  will go up and down on a monthly or quarterly basis 
when demand exceeds supply  prices will rise and lead times will lengthen 
when supply exceeds demands  prices will fall and lead times will shorten 
since intel did not launch the double data rate ii ddr ii system as analysts were anticipating  the dynamic random access memory dram and ddr ii market continues to be soft due to high levels of supply and  accordingly  prices have decreased 
it is predicted that prices will be flat or slightly down in the flash memory market is in a growth mode and prices are expected to increase 
the availability of liquid crystal displays lcds has stabilized with prices up slightly over the last few quarters 
due to the expected demand of lcd tvs  analysts are predicting a shortage of lcds in the second half of calendar  which may impact the availability of lcd products and cause prices to increase 
in order to be more competitive in the commercial display market for our tablet personal computer products  we have purchased duplicate equipment for our max vu tm process technology which has been placed in a manufacturing company located in china 
we expect to start producing parts during the second quarter of fiscal in performing the annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company found indicators of impairment related to the commercial microelectronics reporting units in phoenix and the display reporting unit in oregon 
most of the commercial microelectronics businesses in phoenix was purchased as part of the ids acquisition in january and the display business in oregon was purchased in january based on the current and forecasted competitive market conditions  the company has lowered earnings and cash flow projections for these divisions and expects them to grow more slowly than had previously been projected 
in the commercial microelectronics reporting units  revenue and profitability did not meet management s expectations in fiscal primarily due to the market softness of the raw material associated with dram components which caused a lower average selling price and margin from sales of related products in fiscal  lower than expected orders from one of the division s key customers that experienced a slower than expected growth and market acceptance of its next generation enterprise server systems in fiscal  and the lower than expected sales to a customer that serves the hotel industry because the hurricanes delayed shipments of that customer s entertainment video systems which affected the company s product shipment flow to them with the possibility of further delays in the rollout of these products in fiscal in the display business in oregon  the company changed its business strategy to pursue markets such as transportation  mobile pc  medical and industrial markets to focus on higher margin products 
accordingly  the company must replace the million of fiscal year revenues from ncr corporation that generated margins lower than management s expectations  despite higher volume business 
the company is dedicating fiscal year to the development of further enhancement to its max vu tm process technology and plans to introduce new display products related to this technology 
the company s current projections reflect the risk associated with the costs of the start up product development  the risk of technology transfer to china and the acceptance of this higher end technology in the marketplace 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company wrote down million of the million of unamortized ids acquisition goodwill related to the commercial microelectronics reporting units of which million of the write down is in the microelectronics segment and million is in the display segment 
in addition  the company wrote down million of the million of unamortized goodwill related to the panelview reporting unit in the display segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal the fair value of these reporting units was estimated using standard valuation techniques weighted to a discounted cash flow method  to a market multiples method and to a transaction or cost method 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the internal revenue service completed its examination of our federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended september  and september  based on the results of the examination  we have decreased previously recorded tax reserves by approximately million and decreased income tax expense by a corresponding amount 

table of contents net loss for fiscal year was approximately million compared to net income of approximately million for fiscal the decline was due to the non cash impairment of goodwill described above  offset slightly by the adjustment of the tax reserves 
segments our product and market diversification as well as our broad customer base have allowed us to maintain relative sales stability and profitability 
the following table shows our historical net sales and the percent of net sales by our two business segments and the markets they serve in thousands microelectronic segment military industrial market commercial market display segment military industrial market commercial market total microelectronic segment military industrial market commercial market display segment military industrial market commercial market total for the year ended october   ids contributed approximately million of net sales to the commercial market of our microelectronic segment and approximately million of net sales to the commercial market of our display segment 
for the year ended october   ids contributed approximately million of net sales to the commercial market of our microelectronic segment and approximately million of net sales to the commercial market of our display segment 
for the year ended september   ids contributed approximately million of net sales to the commercial market of our microelectronic segment and approximately million of net sales to the commercial market of our display segment 
the foregoing information includes ids net sales from the date of acquisition on january  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ 
table of contents from those estimates 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include the following items we sell microelectronic and display products primarily to military prime contractors and commercial oems 
a small portion of our products are also sold through distributors or resellers 
we recognize revenue on product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer exists  title to the product has passed to the customer  which usually occurs at time of shipment  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the related billing is reasonably assured 
advance payments from customers are deferred and recognized when the related products are shipped 
revenue relating to products sold to distributors or resellers who either have return rights or where the company has a history of accepting product returns are deferred and recognized when the distributor or reseller sells the product to the end customer 
we also provide limited design services pursuant to related customer purchase orders and generally recognize the associated revenue as such services are performed 
however  it may be deferred until certain elements are completed 
we may from time to time enter into certain arrangements that contain multiple elements such as performing limited design services accompanied with follow on manufacturing of related products 
we allocate revenue to the elements based on relative fair value  and recognize revenue for each element when there is evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
arrangements with multiple elements that are not considered separate units of accounting require deferral of revenue until certain other elements have been delivered or the services have been performed 
the amount of the revenue recognized is impacted by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements  and whether the elements are considered separate units of accounting 
historically  we have experienced fluctuations in the demand for our products based on cyclical fluctuations in the microelectronic and display markets 
these fluctuations may cause inventory on hand to lose value or become obsolete 
in order to present the appropriate inventory value on our financial statements  we identify slow moving or obsolete inventories and record provisions to write down such inventories to net realizable value 
these provisions are based on management s comparison of the value of inventory on hand against expected future sales 
if future sales are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory provisions may be required 
we record trade accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and they do not bear interest 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we make these estimates based on an analysis of accounts receivable using available information on our customers financial status and payment histories 
historically  bad debt losses have not differed materially from our estimates 
write offs against the allowance totaled approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal we maintain a pension plan for eligible union employees at our fort wayne  indiana facility 
to account for the cost of this plan  we make estimates concerning the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and discount rates to be used to calculate future benefit obligations 
changes in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets affect the amount of investment income expected to be earned in the future 
we base our related estimates using historical data on the rate of return from equities and fixed income investments  as well as projections for future returns on such investments 
if the actual returns on plan assets do not equal the estimated amounts  we may have to fund future benefit obligations with additional contributions to the plan 
changes in the discount rate affect the value of the plan s future benefit obligations 
a lower discount rate increases the liabilities of the plan because it raises the value of future benefit obligations 
this will also cause an increase in pension expense recognized 
we use published bond yields to estimate the discount rate used for calculating the value of future benefit obligations 
we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas which requires goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual 
table of contents basis and more frequently in certain circumstances and written down when impaired 
we completed our transitional testing for goodwill impairment upon adoption of sfas  and our annual testing for fiscal and determined that our recorded goodwill was not impaired 
however  in fiscal it was determined that our commercial microelectronics businesses in phoenix and our display business in oregon were impaired 
accordingly  we wrote down the related goodwill by approximately million 
goodwill recorded was million and million at october  and october   respectively 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information relating to the goodwill impairment 
furthermore  sfas requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  generally two to fifteen years 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are recognized  net of any valuation allowance  for deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and  if necessary  establish a valuation allowance 
during the ordinary course of business  there are transaction and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
these reserves are established when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest

however  we began to see in the second quarter of fiscal and expect to continue to see reduced sales to unisys  who previously accounted for more than of microelectronic sales  for their memory modules used in a high end server application which are expected to transition to a new generation of memory modules at lower volumes 
however  we anticipate commercial sales in the microelectronic segment to grow slightly in fiscal military industrial sales in the display segment were million for the year ended october   a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended october  the slight decrease was due to decreased requirements for products used in the commercial aviation industry 
we expect military industrial sales in the display segment in fiscal to be consistent with sales in fiscal commercial sales in the display segment were million for the year ended october   an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended october  
table of contents the increase from prior year is attributable to increased sales to ncr of million and million of our tablet personal computer products over the prior year  partially offset by decreased sales to other customers during the period 
due to our strategic decision not to pursue future business in low margin products and the resulting completion of the ncr contract in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we expect commercial sales in the display segment to be flat in fiscal on command corporation accounted for approximately million  or of our microelectronic segment sales as compared to million  or  and million  or  in and microelectronic segment sales  respectively 
northrop grumman accounted for approximately million  or of our microelectronic segment sales as compared to approximately million  or  of our microelectronic segment sales and approximately million  or  of our microelectronic segment sales 
no other customer accounted for more than of segment or total net sales for these periods 
in  ncr accounted for approximately million  or  of our display segment net sales as compared to million or approximately of our display sales in in  million  or  of our display segment net sales came from whirlpool as compared to approximately million  or  in we had no sales from garmin in fiscal  and approximately million  or  of net sales for our display segment came from garmin  compared to million  or  of net sales  while ge medical accounted for approximately million  or  of display segment net sales compared to million  or  of display segment net sales and approximately million  or  of display segment net sales 
our sales to garmin and ge medical declined significantly during fiscal due to a shift in their manufacturing strategies 
we do not expect net sales to increase to their previous levels 
the majority of our commercial sales are not subject to seasonal fluctuations over the course of a year 
sales of our membrane keypad products  which totaled approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal  are subject to seasonal fluctuations relating to home appliance sales in the spring and fall 
our military sales tend to follow the government s fiscal year  which ends in september  and are typically less in the first quarter of our fiscal year and strong in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
gross profit gross profit was million for the year ended october   an increase of million or approximately from million for the year ended october  gross margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately for the year ended october   compared to approximately for the year ended october  gross profit for the microelectronic segment was million for the year ended october   an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended october  the majority of the increase in gross profit came from an increase in military industrial sales in the microelectronic segment as a result of changes in product mix  lower manufacturing costs  and higher sales volume 
gross margin as a percentage of microelectronic segment net sales was approximately for the year ended october   compared to approximately for the year ended october  the product mix in the microelectronic segment shifted to a greater number of military products  which historically have a higher selling price and higher gross margin than commercial products 
gross profit for the display segment was million for the year ended october   a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended october  gross margin as a percentage of display segment net sales was approximately for the year ended october   compared to approximately for the year ended october  the decrease in gross margin was the result of the higher costs of acquiring initial inventory in connection with the start up of new programs 
we have seen the inventory costs as a percentage of net sales decrease as sales volumes have increased for such programs and component prices have decreased during the fiscal year 
other product mix also contributed to the decline in display segment gross margins 
we have recently made a strategic decision not to pursue future business in low margin products as we continue to come under pressure from both domestic and asian competition 
while we are implementing business and manufacturing strategies to improve our competitive position  it may be difficult to improve current gross margins in the future 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation expense  selling expenses  including commissions  information technology expenses and corporate administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended october   an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended october  this increase was due to a million increase in general and administrative expenses  offset by a decrease in selling expenses of million over the comparable period 
general and administrative expenses increased mainly because of higher professional fees of million in connection with compliance with sarbanes oxley act and recent accounting requirements  million for compensation and million related to an abandoned acquisition 
selling expenses decreased primarily due to lower commissions 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses have remained consistent with the prior year at approximately of net sales 
as part of our overall management planning and analysis process  we have traditionally targeted approximately of net sales for selling  general and administrative expenses 
however  it is probable that selling  general and administrative expenses will be higher than of net sales due to continuing costs associated with the sarbanes oxley act and increased expenses due to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation for our engineering personnel  consulting expenses and project materials 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended october   a decrease of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended october  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in our display segment due to completion of product development projects 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales have remained consistent and averaged between and of net sales over the past two years 
we are committed to research and development of new and existing products and expect research and development expenses to remain at approximately the same percentage of net sales in the future 
ongoing product development projects for the microelectronic segment include new packaging designs for various types of memory products including the latest technology  double data rate ddr ii memory modules  along with microprocessor modules and ball grid array packaging products using these semiconductors  continuing development of anti tamper technology for microelectronic products  next generation memory and power personal computer products assembled in various multi chip packages to be used in both commercial and military markets  and qualification of new semiconductor products

table of contents interest income interest income consists of interest earned on our cash balances invested primarily in a money market account 
interest income was million for the year ended october   an increase of million compared to million for the year ended october  this increase was attributable to the increase in invested balances between periods  primarily as a result of the reinvestment of cash flows from operations  and increased interest rates 
amortization of intangible assets we adopted sfas on september  and discontinued amortization of goodwill at that time 
intangible asset amortization for the years ended october  and october  totaled million and million  respectively  almost entirely related to intangible assets acquired from ids

income tax expense was million for the year ended october   compared to million for the year ended october  the effective tax rate was approximately for the year ended october   compared to approximately for the year ended october  the company s effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory tax rate of due to state taxes and the impact of the million goodwill impairment which has no income tax benefit  partially offset by reductions for foreign sales exclusions  research and experimentation tax credits currently available for federal income tax purposes  and the adjustment of tax reserves 
excluding the goodwill impairment  the fourth quarter income tax adjustment of million and the third quarter provision return adjustment of million  our effective tax rate would have been approximately for the year ended october  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the internal revenue service completed its examination of our federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended september  and september  based on the results of the examination  we have decreased previously recorded tax reserves by approximately million and decreased income tax expense by a corresponding amount 
in october  congress passed the american jobs creation act of the act  which will eliminate the extraterritorial income exclusion  and will provide a deduction from taxable income equal to a stipulated percentage of qualified income from domestic production activities  referred to as the manufacturer deduction 
the extraterritorial income exclusion will be phased out through  and the manufacturer deduction will be phased in through the company is currently studying the implication of these provisions  but does not believe the act will have a significant impact on its effective rate in fiscal fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales net sales were million for the year ended october   a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended september  military industrial sales in the microelectronic segment were million for the year ended october   a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  the decrease in sales was primarily due to a significant one time order of approximately million in fiscal to a military prime contractor related to the falcon edge program and as a result of the shift in military spending priorities which lowered the volume of sales 
commercial sales in the microelectronic segment were million for the year ended october   an increase of million  or approximately from million for the year ended september  the growth was primarily attributable to products used in the high end server applications and product sold to a hotel industry supplier for their entertainment video systems 

table of contents military industrial sales in the display segment were million for the year ended october   an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  the increase was due to increased requirements for products used in the commercial aviation industry  which resulted in more product being sold 
commercial sales in the display segment were million for the year ended october   a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  the decrease primarily comes from the loss of orders from ge medical and garmin  both of whom changed their manufacturing strategies in the fourth quarter of this was offset by increases in sales of displays for portable patient monitors  tablet personal computers and point of service terminals 
northrop grumman accounted for approximately million  or  of our microelectronic segment sales compared to approximately million  or  of our microelectronic segment sales

research and development expenses were million for the year ended october   consistent with the million for the year ended september  expenses in the microelectronic segment decreased by million primarily due to the closure of our massachusetts location  and increased million in the display segment due to the continued investment in new products to offset the loss of orders from ge medical and garmin 
interest expense interest expense primarily consisted of interest expense on our long term debt 
interest expense was  for the year ended october   a decrease of  from  for the year ended september  interest expense for the year ended september  related to our assumption of approximately million of debt in connection with the acquisition of ids

income tax expense was million for the year ended october   compared to million for the year ended september  the effective tax rate was approximately for the year ended october   compared to approximately for the year ended september  the decrease in the effective tax rate in was a result of additional available research and development credits 
liquidity and capital resources cash on hand as of october  totaled approximately million and was primarily invested in a money market account 
during fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities was approximately million versus million in fiscal depreciation and amortization totaled approximately million for fiscal we expect depreciation and amortization to remain consistent over the next few quarters 
the reductions in inventory and increases in accrued expenses were the primary sources of positive cash flow for the year ended october  compared to fiscal year payments against accounts payable were the primary use of cash during the period 
accounts receivable increased approximately million from fiscal year  primarily as a result of an overall increase in net sales of million from the quarter ended october  days sales outstanding

our days sales outstanding typically approximate days 
inventories decreased approximately million from fiscal year inventory of approximately million as of october  represents days of inventory on hand  a decrease from days on hand at october  the levels of inventory fluctuate based on changes in expected production requirements and availability of raw materials 
inventory amounts will generally take several quarters to adjust to significant changes in future sales 
also  as lead times for raw materials increase  we are required to purchase larger amounts of inventory per order and hold it for longer periods of time 
this would have the effect of increasing our days inventory on hand 
we expect to fund any increases in inventory caused by sales growth or manufacturing planning requirements from our cash balances and operating cash flows 
prepaid expenses decreased approximately million from the end of fiscal this is primarily due to the receipt of income tax refunds from the filing of tax returns and the timing of prepayments 
accounts payable as of october  were approximately million lower than at the end of fiscal  primarily related to our payments for inventory purchased during the fourth quarter of accrued expenses as of october  increased approximately million from the end of fiscal accrued salaries and benefits were approximately million higher at october  compared to the end of fiscal due to higher vacation sick balances  accrued compensation and the timing of payments

we expect to incur approximately million in capital expenditures for tenant improvements 
as of the end of the year  we had incurred approximately million in improvements  with the remainder to be purchased over the next two quarters 
we have also put the ids land and building in phoenix on the market 
we expect proceeds from the sale of the land and building to exceed our net book value of approximately million as of october   however  we do not expect any ultimate gain or loss to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
we expect to fund these improvements and additional purchases from our cash balances and operating cash flows 
we maintain a pension plan for eligible union employees at our fort wayne  indiana facility pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement 
mainly because of a lower discount rate used to value expected future benefit obligations  the pension plan is currently under funded by approximately million

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of october   we had no borrowings on our revolving line of credit with bank one 
should we borrow against the line  interest charged on these borrowings would be at the lower of either the bank s prime rate or libor plus 
during fiscal  the bank s prime rate averaged and was as of october  we are subject to changes in the prime rate based on federal reserve actions and general market interest fluctuations 
we are also subject to fluctuations in the libor rate 
as of october   the libor rate was approximately 
should we begin borrowing against the credit line  annual interest expense at would be approximately  for every million borrowed 
a hypothetical increased rate change of would increase interest expense by approximately  per million borrowed on an annual basis 
we believe that moderate interest rate increases will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  liquidity or financial position 
we believe that we are not subject in any material way to other forms of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk on foreign customer purchase orders we accept payment in us dollars only or commodity price risk
