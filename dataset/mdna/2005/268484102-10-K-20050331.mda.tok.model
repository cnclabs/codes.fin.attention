item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
in addition  for information on our critical accounting policies and the judgment made in their application  please read critical accounting policies and estimates beginning on page restatement of previously issued financial statements we have restated our historical financial statements for  and the first three quarters of the adjustments reflected in our restated financial statements are comprised primarily of the following items deferred income taxes for unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign entities 
we determined that we had understated deferred tax expense related to unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign operations for periods prior to january  we had previously disclosed in a current report on form k on march   that these adjustments reduced retained earnings as of january  by million 
however  further analysis led to an additional adjustment of million 
these adjustments in total reduced retained earnings as of january  by million and increased noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities for each of the periods restated 
recognition of straight line rent expense when the lease term in a real estate operating lease contains a period where there are free or reduced rents commonly referred to as rent holidays and scheduled rent increases 
we historically had not been recognizing the rent expense on a straight line basis over the term of the operating lease for certain of our facility leases 
these adjustments reduced retained earnings as of january  by million  increased net income for the nine months ended september  by million and increased accrued selling  general and administrative expenses and other liabilities by million as of december  and and by   and  as of march   june  and september   respectively 
reconciliation of various account balances 
with respect to our operations in mexico  account reconciliation adjustments for errors reduced retained earnings as of january  by million  cash and cash equivalents by million and other receivables by  and increased accrued salaries and related costs by  and accrued selling  general and administrative expenses and other liabilities by  other than mexico  adjustments to correct account balances increased net income for the nine months ended september  by million and affected various accounts within our consolidated balance sheets as detailed in the tables within note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
reclassification adjustments 
we determined certain revenues and costs of transportation presentations within the us and certain international locations were not in accordance with our revenue recognition policy with regards to reporting revenues when we act as an indirect carrier versus an authorized cargo sales agent 
for and  our revenues and costs of transportation were reduced by million and million  respectively 
for the nine months ended september   revenues and costs of transportation were reduced by million 
the reclassification had no effect on net revenues  operating income or net income 
in addition  certain amounts were reclassified on the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and and march  related to reclassifying minority interest payable to goodwill for ou r buyout of a minority interest partner in thailand completed in  netting of income tax receivables by tax jurisdictions and reclassifying current and long term portions of certain liabilities 
the cumulative effect of the adjustments reduced retained earnings as of january  by million and increased net income for the nine months ended september  by million 
net income for and remain unchanged 
the million adjustment to net income for the nine months ended september  resulted from an increase in first quarter net income of million  an increase in second quarter net income of million and a reduction in third quarter net income of million 
all applicable amounts relating to these restatements have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion gives effect to these corrections 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
overview the primary macroeconomic growth indicators of our business include general growth in the economy  international trade  particularly out of asia  the level of high tech spending and the increase in outsourcing of logistics projects 
business drivers that we control and focus on internally are our ability to i link transportation services with our logistics services  ii cross sell our services to existing and prospective customers and iii collaborate with our customers to provide flexible  cost effective and profitable supply chain solutions 
we achieved revenues of billion for the year ended december   a increase over revenues of billion in our financial position was strengthened by record gross and net revenues throughout despite growth in our business  we remain committed to leveraging our infrastructure by containing our operating expenses and improving our yield management in our results of operations in were impacted by  among other things  the following leveraging our global network to increase volumes across all service offerings and geographic divisions  improved volumes in north america forwarding market  the divestiture of non core investments miami air and tds logistics and buyout of joint ventures in france  spain and portugal to focus on our core competencies  the faster rate of growth in lower margin but higher net revenue per shipment service offerings international air and ocean coupled with escalating ocean and airline rates and fuel surcharges  costs associated with compliance efforts with section of the sarbanes oxley act  our effective tax rate  the repurchase of million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of per share pursuant to our stock repurchase program  the issuance of million shares of our common stock upon the conversion of all outstanding million convertible subordinated notes  entering into a new  million unsecured revolving credit facility  improved operational efficiencies which contributed to an increase in operating income by compared to  and continuing the deployment of information technology systems globally 
leveraging our global network 
in  we leveraged our global network and our ability to cross sell services to increase volumes for all of our service offerings in all geographic divisions 
in addition  our balanced product offering enabled us to provide flexible solutions to our customers both domestically and internationally 
in  we continued to leverage our low cost north america network and customer base  as customers increasingly moved products overseas directly to us distribution and retail centers 
north america forwarding market 
deferred shipment third through fifth day volumes increased by in versus a decline of in and priority next flight out  next day or second day volumes showed an increase of in versus a decline of in in addition  us imports and exports continue to increase  reflecting the strength of the us economy and the continued shift of production overseas 
the improvement in domestic shipment volumes added significantly to our increase in gross revenues during the year and improved results of operations 
our results highlight the ability of our low cost domestic model to generate domestic growth with a mix of priority and deferred shipments 
divestitures of non core investments and buyout of joint venture interests 
in  we eliminated non core investments and joint venture interests in order to focus on our core competencies for our customers 
in may  we sold our investment in miami air in exchange for approximately million in cash 
as a result of the sale  we were released as guarantor of miami air s letter of credit and terminated the million standby letter of credit for miami air 
we no longer have a relationship with miami air 
in august  tds logistics  inc  in which we held a interest  was sold to an unrelated party 
as a result  we eliminated an interest in a non core business and recorded a million gain in non operating income for our investment and cash proceeds of approximately million  excluding approximately million of our sale proceeds held in escrow 
in addition  we acquired the remaining interests in joint ventures in france  spain and portugal the latter two from the former chief executive officer of circle during the first half of as a result  we eliminated the joint venture structure in europe that was a remnant of the merger with circle and will retain of the profits in france  spain and portugal going forward 
net revenue margins 
as we were able to cross sell our services to our customers  our net revenues in were impacted by the growth of service offerings with different margins our ocean and international air service offerings with lower net revenue margins but higher net revenue per shipment grew at faster rates than our domestic offerings 
for example  increases in ocean and international shipments increase our gross revenues  but they have a lower margin  which causes our overall margins to decrease 
in addition  the traditional peak season rates beginning in the third quarter and extending into the fourth quarter  together with higher fuel and security surcharges second half of and tighter capacity year long  continued to impact our air and ocean margins 
management believes that as we improve our ability to address the global factors affecting rates for our service offerings  including  but not limited to  ensuring that our customers absorb traditional pass through costs and effective management of contract rates during peak seasons  our margins should improve across all geographic divisions and service offerings 
costs associated with compliance efforts with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
in  we incurred expenses of million for consulting and audit fees as a result of compliance efforts with respect to section of sarbanes oxley 
of the million  million million after tax  or per share was incurred in the fourth quarter 
effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate for was compared to for the effective tax rate was higher than mainly related to additional deferred income tax expense on foreign operations for which additional tax reserves were recorded 
our effective tax rates fluctuate due to changes in the level of pre tax income in foreign countries that have different rates and certain income and or expenses that are permanently non taxable or non deductible in certain jurisdictions 
share repurchase program 
in  we repurchased million shares at an average price of per share for approximately million 
convertible notes 
as of december   all of the note holders of the entire million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due december  converted their notes into an aggregate of  shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the note and the indenture  dated as of december  we received no consideration upon conversion of the notes into shares of our common stock 
new credit facility 
in september  we entered into a new  unsecured million credit facility  which replaced a million secured credit facility that was to mature in december under our new credit facility  we have increased borrowing capacity for  among other things permitted acquisitions  working capital and capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding and unused borrowing capacity of million under the new credit facility 
improving operational efficiencies 
during  we continued initiatives to improve operating efficiencies  which contributed to an increase in operating income by  or million  from operating income as a percent of net revenue increased from in to in we have launched further initiatives to measure the key drivers of our business and continue to drive profitability through operational efficiencies in global deployment of information technology systems 
in  we continued the global deployment of our egl vision suite of technologies logistics vision  financial vision and people vision 
logistics vision is the freight forwarding system that allows a seamless flow of data across the globe  eliminating duplicate data entry on multiple systems 
financial vision is the oracle based financial system that allows global visibility of financial results  streamlined financial reporting and the ability to automate intercompany accounting and settlements 
people vision is the oracle based human resources application that allows global visibility to employee tracking  training and development 
management continues to believe that successful deployment of systems remains a critical component of impr oving operational efficiencies and effectively growing the business 
the global deployment of egl vision will continue into our focus in will be to improve operational efficiencies  streamline processes through our global deployment of our financial and operational information technology systems see business information systems and continue to leverage our north america infrastructure 
results of operations our principal services are air freight forwarding  ocean freight forwarding  customs brokerage and other value added logistics services 
revenues for air freight and ocean freight consolidations indirect shipments include reimbursements from customers for the cost of transporting such freight 
revenues for air freight and ocean freight agency or direct shipments  customs brokerage and other services  include only the fees or commissions for these services 
we believe that a comparison of gross revenues by product best measures the relative importance of our principal services  while a comparison of net revenue margins net revenues as a percent of gross revenues best measures the performance of each product line 
a comparison of operating expenses as a percent of net revenues considers the relationship between operating expenses and operating revenues

net revenues  which represent revenues less freight transportation costs  increased million  or  to million in compared to million in net revenue margins net revenues as a percentage of revenues declined by basis points in to as compared to in the decrease in margins reflects i higher transportation and fuel costs due to capacity constraints  mainly from asia  ii fuel surcharges absorbed by the business  iii an acceleration of gr owth in international air and ocean products which carry a lower net revenue margin but higher net revenue per shipment  and iv pass through of certain fuel and security surcharges  which increased gross revenues without corresponding increases in net revenues 
our international revenues and costs also increased slightly over the prior year due to the effects of translating amounts to the us dollar 
air freight forwarding revenues 
air freight forwarding revenues increased million  or  to  million in compared to  million in due to volume increases in all geographic divisions  particularly asia south pacific  north america and europe middle east 
this growth is primarily from improvements in shipment volumes and international charter activity 
air freight forwarding net revenues increased million  or  to million in compared to million in air freight forwarding net revenues increased primarily in north america followed by europe middle east and asia south pacific 
the air freight forwarding margin net revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased to for as compared to for primarily due to declines in north america and asia south pacific resulting from higher volume levels in certain trade lanes that carry a lower margin  higher fuel surcharges from carriers and increases in international charter activity which typically carries a lower margin 
these decreases were offset by increases in air freight forwarding margins in europe middle east primarily due to an increase in higher margin direct air shipments relative to consolidated sh ipments

the increase is mainly associated with additional or larger replacement facilities to accommodate increased operations 
a portion of the increase in facility expense is due to a million net increase in facility accruals mainly covering north america 
in north america  we consolidated three facilities into our new facility in miami  which was completed in late we subleas ed one of the north american facilities for less than our remaining obligation and accrued the net amount of lease payments we expect to pay over the remaining lease term 
during the year  we accrued additional lease expense in north america and europe on two vacant facilities due to unfavorable market conditions near the facilities 
we subsequently released these accruals as we decided to utilize the north america facility for increased operations and the facility in europe was subleased earlier than assumed in the previous accrual 
we also released a million accrual originally recorded in prior years for a facility in houston  texas as we decided to utilize this facility for increased operations 
other selling  general and administrative expenses have also increased due to higher professional fees and communications costs related to systems implementations and preparations for internal controls testing required by the sarbanes oxley act of and foreign exchange effects

the air freight forwarding margin net revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased to for as compared to for air freight forwarding net revenue margins declined in all geographic divisions  primarily due to airline rate increases we were not able to recover through comparable price increases to our customers and the shift from priority to deferred shipments in the u 
s  which generally have a lower margin 
air freight forwarding net revenue margins were also negatively impacted by an unfavorable settlement with kitty hawk  inc  a wholesale transportation provider  stemming from a dispute in the dispute was resolved by an arbitration panel during the third quarter of and we recorded a charge of million in air freight forwarding cost of transportation

other selling  general and administrative expenses also decreased as a result of a million gain on the sale of our facility in boston in september and a  charge recorded during the third quarter of related to a management decision not to use certain architectural design plans for a proposed building in canada 
these cost savings were partially offset by an increase in facility costs  insurance premiums and depreciat ion expense 
although we completed the consolidation of many of our facilities  our facility costs increased by approximately million because we are leasing more space than in the previous year for our expanded warehousing and logistics services primarily in europe and north america  expansion of several stations in the us and the acquisition of miami international forwarders mif in april the increase in depreciation expense was largely related to increases in computer software and office equipment depreciation

nonoperating expense  net also decreased due to lower interest cost from our interest rate swap  which expired in april  and higher income from our jet fuel swap entered into during november additionally  we incurred net foreign exchange losses of million in compared to net foreign exchange gains of  in  primarily due to deterioration of the us dollar 
effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate for was compared to for our overall effective tax rate fluctuates primarily due to changes in the level of pre tax income in foreign countries that have different rates and certain income and or expenses that are permanently non taxable or non deductible in certain jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources general our ability to satisfy our debt obligations  fund working capital and make capital expenditures depends upon our future performance  which is subject to general economic conditions and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
if we achieve significant near term revenue growth  we may experience a need for increased working capital financing as a result of the difference between our collection cycles and the timing of our payments to vendors 
historically we have generated cash flow from operations in the first half of the year higher than in the second half of the year reflecting the seasonality of our business 
we make significant disbursements on behalf of our customers for transportation costs primarily ocean and customs duties for which the customer is the primary obligor 
the billings to customers for these disbursements  which are several times the amount of revenues and fees derived from these transactions  are not recorded as revenues and expense on our statement of operations  rather  they are reflected in our trade receivables and trade payables 
growth in the level of this activity or lengthening of the period of time between incurring these costs and being reimbursed by our customers for these costs may negatively affect our liquidity 
as primarily a non asset based freight forwarder  we do not have the same level of capital expenditures that would be required of an asset based forwarder 
we believe our anticipated capital expenditures for will be in the range of to million  including approximately to million expected on information systems expenditures 
based on current plans  we believe that our existing capital resources  including million of cash and cash equivalents and million of available borrowing capacity on our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements through december  however  future changes in our business could cause us to consume available resources before that time 
additionally  funds may not be available when needed and even if available  additional funds may be raised through financing arrangements and or the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities on terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  which could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are unavailable  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some of our operating activities  including  without limitation  the timing and extent of our marketing programs  and the extent and timing of hiring additional personnel 
we cannot provide assurance that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all

the libor rate is equal to the rate determined by bank of america  na to be the british bankers association interest rate for deposits in us dollars for a similar interest period either one  two  three or six months  as selected by us 
the base rate is calculated as the higher of i the federal funds effective rate plus and ii the annual rate of interest announced by bank of america  na as its prime rate 
we may borrow at the prime rate plu s an applicable margin of up to or at the libor rate plus an applicable margin of to 
the credit facility contains covenants that are similar to  but generally more favorable to us than  the covenants in our prior credit facility

we were in compliance with the restrictions of the credit facility as of december  the prior credit facility with bank of america  na was terminated by us on september  in advance of its stated termination date without any early termination penalties 
deferred financing fees of million including  from the prior credit facility are being amortized over five years as a component of interest expense 
release of restricted cash 
in february  in response to a joint motion filed by egl and the eeoc  a us district court ordered the return of million to us of million previously held in an established fund to resolve potential claims in connection with a consent decree see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the joint motion and subsequent order resulted primarily from a significantly lower number of qualified claimants than originally projected and the aggregate amount expected to be paid for all claims is less than million 
release of these funds is expected to result in million in income in the first quarter of other guarantees 
several of our foreign operations guarantee amounts associated with our international freight forwarding services

we acquired the land in august from a related party entity controlled by mr 
crane for million in cash  including acquisition costs of  this parcel of land had been previously identified by us as the most advantageous property on which to consolidate our miami operations 
we entered into negotiations on the land and reached agreement with the seller on terms 
however  given the downturn in the economy and our weakening financial condition at that point in time  we elected to delay purchasing this property until our financial condition improved 
on july   mr 
crane purchased the land in antici pation of reselling the land to egl 
our audit committee  consisting of four independent directors  engaged in an analysis and discussion regarding whether it was in the best interest of egl to enter into a purchase agreement to purchase this particular tract of land from mr 
crane 
the audit committee s analysis included  but was not limited to  obtaining an independent appraisal of the land  reviewing a comparative properties analysis performed by an outside independent real estate company and performing a cost benefit analysis for several different alternatives 
based upon the data obtained from the analysis  the audit committee determined the best alternative for egl  in its opinion  was for us to purchase the property from mr 
crane 
the audit committee then made a recommendation to our board of directors  which includes six independent directors  to purchase this land at mr 
crane s purchase price plus carrying costs  which was lower than the current market value 
in august  our board of directors unanimously approved the purchase  with mr

seasonality historically  our operating results have been subject to a limited degree to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
typically  our first fiscal quarter is weaker when compared to our other fiscal quarters of the corresponding year 
the seasonality of our business is a result of a variety of factors  including holiday seasons  consumer demand  economic conditions and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot accurately forecast many of these factors  nor can we estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor 
as a result  there can be no assurance that historical patterns  if any  will continue in future periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management considers many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls  and in developing the assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements 
management must apply significant judgment in this process 
among the factors  but not fully inclusive of all factors that may be considered by management in these processes are the range of accounting policies permitted by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management s understanding of the company s business both historical results and expected future results  the extent to which operational controls exist that provide high degrees of assurance that all desired information to assist in the estimation is available and reliable or whether there is greater uncertainty in the information that is available upon which to base the estimate  expectations of the future performance of the economy domestically  globally and within various sectors that serve our principal customers and suppliers of goods and services  expected rates of change  sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends 
the estimation process often times may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes and management must select an amount that lies within that range of reasonable estimates which may result in the selection of estimates that may be viewed as conservative or aggressive by others based upon the quantity  quality and risks associated with the variability that might be expected from the future outcome and the factors considered in developing the estimate 
management attempts to use its business and financial accounting judgment in selecting the most appropriate estimate  however  actual amounts could and will differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition domestic revenues and most domestic operating costs are recognized when shipments are picked up from the customer 
international revenues and freight consolidation costs are recognized in the period when shipments are tendered to a carrier for transport to a foreign destination 
this is one of the permissible methods under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process 
this method generally results in recognition of revenues and gross profit earlier than methods that do not recognize revenues until a proof of delivery is received 
customs brokerage and other revenues are recognized upon completing the documents necessary for customs clearance or completing other fee based services 
revenues recognized as an indirect air carrier or an ocean freight consolidator includes the direct carri er s charges to egl for carrying the shipment 
revenues recognized in other capacities include only the commission and fees received 
in january  eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred was effective for egl 
this issue clarified certain provisions of eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and among other things established when reimbursements are required to be shown gross as opposed to net 
we report the costs of certain reimbursed incidental activities on a gross basis in revenues and cost of transportation 
we derive our revenues from three principal sources air freight forwarding  ocean freight forwarding  and customs brokerage  import and logistics services 
air and ocean freight forwarding 
as primarily a non asset based carrier  we do not own transportation assets 
instead  we generate the majority of our air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct asset based carriers and reselling those services to our customers as an indirect carrier 
additionally  we generate air freight and ocean freight forwarding revenues to a lesser extent as an authorized cargo sales agent 
as an indirect carrier  we obtain shipments from our customers  consolidate shipments bound for a particular destination  determine the routing  select the direct carrier and tender each consolidated lot as a single shipment to the direct carrier for transportation to a distribution point 
we issue a house airway bill hawb or a house ocean bill of lading hobl to customers as the contract of carriage 
in turn  when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier  we receive a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for air freight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments 
we are the direct point of contact for service fulfillment and resolving any service failures or claims for lost or damaged freight resulting from either our or the direct carriers actions 
in addition  if we do not collect from our customers  we are still responsible for paying the direct carrier 
due to the high volume of freight we manage  we generally obtain lower rates from the direct carriers than the rates we charge our customers for individual shipments 
this rate differential is the primary source of our air and ocean freight net revenues 
we have complete discretion in selecting the means  route and procedures to be followed in the handling  transportation and delivery of freight 
we select the direct carrier that will provide the most economical routing in an effort to maximize net revenues 
revenues related to shipments where we act as an indirect carrier are reported based on the gross amount billed to the customer and include the charges for carrying the shipments 
based upon the terms in the contract of carriage  revenues are recognized at the time the freight is tendered to the direct carrier at origin 
costs related to the shipments are also recognized at this time 
as an authorized cargo sales agent of most airlines and ocean shipping lines  we also arrange for transportation of individual shipments and receive a commission from the airline or ocean shipping line for arranging the shipments 
when acting in this capacity  we do not consolidate shipments or have responsibility for shipments once they have been tendered to the carrier 
therefore  revenues include only the commissions and fees received 
these revenues are recognized upon completion of the services 
customs brokerage and other services 
customs brokerage and import services involve providing services at destinations  such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation  calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery 
we also offer a range of logistics services  distribution and materials management services  international insurance services  global project management services and trade facilitation services 
revenues include the fees received for these services and are recognized upon completion of the services 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors based on the expected ultimate recovery of trade receivables 
we maintain a bad debt reserve for all customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  general and specific economic trends  significant one time events and historical customer collection experience 
also  we record additional reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
trade receivables include disbursements made by us on behalf of our customers for transportation costs and customs duties 
as the billings to customers for these disbursements may be several times the amount of revenues and fees derived from these transactions  the inability to collect such amounts could result in losses greater than the revenues recognized when such billings were recorded 
if circumstances related to customers change  our estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts would be further adjusted 
computer software certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal use software during the application development stage are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software 
the following types of costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized a external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software  b payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use software project  c interest costs incurred in developing software for internal use  and d costs to develop or obtain software that allows for access or conversion of old data into new systems 
costs related to the preliminary project stage  data conversion and the post implementation operation stage of a software development project a re expensed as incurred 
on retirement or sale of assets  the cost of such assets and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss  if any  is credited or charged to income 
we have incurred substantial costs during the periods presented related to a number of information systems projects that were being developed over that time period 
inherent in the capitalization of those projects are the assumptions that after considering the technological and business issues related to their development  such development efforts will be successfully completed and that benefits to be provided by the completed projects will exceed the costs capitalized to develop the systems 
management believes that all projects capitalized at december  will be successfully completed and will result in benefits recoverable in future periods 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is a residual amount and is determined after numerous estimates are made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities included in a business combination  and therefore  indirectly affected by management s estimates and judgments 
we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of est imated future cash flows 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the income approach  which we use to estimate the fair value of our reporting units is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue  costs  cash flows and capital expenditures  and the timing thereof  appropriate discount rates  tax rates and other variables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain assumptions to allocate shared assets  liabilities and overhead costs to calculate the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
impairment of assets substantial judgment is necessary in the determination as to whether an event or circumstance has occurred that may trigger an impairment analysis and in determination of the related cash flows from the asset 
estimating cash flows related to long lived assets is a difficult and subjective process that applies historical experience and future business expectations to revenues and related operating costs of assets 
should impairment appear to be necessary  subjective judgment must be applied to estimate the fair value of the asset  for which there may be no ready market  which oftentimes results in the use of discounted cash flow analysis and judgmental selection of discount rates to be used in the discounting process 
if we determine an asset has been impaired based on the projected undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or the business unit over the remaining amortization period  and if the cash flow analysis indicates that the carrying amount of an asset exceeds related undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value of the asset or the present value of the expected future cash flows 
merger and restructuring we have engaged in merger and restructuring actions which require our management to utilize significant estimates related to future lease obligations for duplicate facilities  expenses for severance and other employee separation costs and costs for termination of joint venture agency agreements 
management makes significant estimates  including the amount of sublease income we will recover for future lease obligations on duplicate facilities 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
taxes on earnings our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements could impact our effective tax rate 
we reversed half of the valuation allowance that was fully reserved for our state net operating losses during the fourth quarter 
we also recorded valuation allowances to fully reserve deferred tax assets generated from certain foreign jurisdictions 
we considered our historical performance  forecasted taxable income and other factors in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowance 
objective factors such as current year and previous year net operating loss utilization were given more weight than our outlook for future realization of the losses 
we believe we should generate sufficient taxable income to utilize a substantial portion of our net operating loss carryforwards before their expiration 
we also have deferred tax assets for certain foreign and federal tax credits which management believes will be fully realized in the fut ure based on current year utilization of foreign tax credits and our outlook for future utilization 
in order to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the specific tax jurisdictions to offset the deferred tax assets 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
if we later determine or are able to realize the deferred tax assets for the state or foreign net operating losses our valuation allowance could be reversed 
our federal income tax returns from fiscal years to are currently subject to audit by the internal revenue service 
management believes it has filed such returns in accordance with applicable tax laws in effect at the time 
however  there is no assurance that such audits will not result in future adjustments

 and sfas r 
sfas r expanded the disclosure requirements for benefit plans to include information describing the types of plan assets  investment strategy  measurement date s  plan obligations  cash flows  and components of net periodic benefit cost recognized during interim periods 
most of the additional disclosures required by sfas r were effective for annual periods ending after december  and interim periods beginning after december   except for annual disclosures for foreign plans  in which annual disclosures were effective for periods ending after june  all of our defined benefit plans are foreign plans and  accordingly  we have included disclosures required by sfas r in these consolidated financial statements 
in march  the emerging issues task force issued statement no 
 or eitf  participating securities and the two class method under financial accounting standards board statement no 
 earnings per share 
eitf addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when  and if  it declares dividends on its common stock 
the statement also provides further guidance in applying the two class method of calculating earnings per share  clarifying what constitutes a participating security and how to apply the two class method of computing earnings per share once it is determined that a security is participating  including how to allocate undistributed earnings t o such a security 
eitf was effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  the adoption of eitf did not have an impact on our computation of earnings per share

 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period beginning after june   with early adoption encouraged 
in addition  sfas r will cause unrecognized expense based on the amount in our pro forma footnote disclosure related to options vesting after the date of initial adoption to be recognized as a charge to results of operations over the remaining vesting p eriod 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of  beginning july  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition alternatives include prospective and retrospective adoption methods  prior periods may be restated either as the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and share awards as of the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retrospective methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and share awards beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expect the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations  earnings per share and consolidated statement of cash flows 
we have not determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r

fsp states that a company is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for pur poses of applying sfas no 
we have not yet determined if we intend to repatriate foreign earnings under the provisions in the act 
thus  our consolidated financial statements do not reflect a provision for taxes related to this election 
any such repatriation under the act must occur by december  the range of any reasonable amount of repatriation is not available at this time
