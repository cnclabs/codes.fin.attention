item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant accounting estimates we prepare the consolidated financial statements of the company in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
we also offer certain of our customers the right to return shafts for breakage within a limited time after delivery 
we track such shaft returns  and we record a provision for the estimated amount of such future returns  based on historical experience and any notification we receive of pending returns at the time sales are made 
the company believes that shafts returned for breakage will be returned within three years of the initial sale of the shaft 
the company estimates that will be returned in the fi rst year after sale  in the second year after sale and the remaining in the third year after sale  assuming a mid year convention 
the company s breakage return rate has been between 
and breakage returns divided by sales dollars for the past ten years 
the company has historically utilized a four year moving average of the breakage return rate to record its estimated liability 
the four year average utilized in the accrual estimate as of december  is 
the company s breakage return rate has declined over the past years 
the highest four year average over the past four years has been 
if the company were to use in estimating its liability as of december   it would have the effect of increasing the liability by approximately  which would be recorded in cost of goods sold 
while such returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their curren t credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivables and our future operating results 
the company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis  by reviewing all amounts owed to the company and focusing on those amounts that are greater than days past due 
the company reviews the customers that have amounts greater than days past due and where appropriate reserves for the receivable amount 
as of december   the company estimated this amount to be approximately  if the company were to reserve for the total amount greater than days past due  it would increase the allowance by approximately  which would be recorded in administrative expense 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inve ntory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
management of the company  including but not limited to  representatives from manufacturing  sales  accounting and officers review the inventory reserve methodology quarterly and when appropriate  establish additional reserves or reduce existing reserves 
the company s reserve methodology consists of the following  reviewing on hand inventories of our top customers and comparing inventories to their anticipated sales forecast 
a reserve is established for all shafts that are deemed to be obsolete 
raw materials are reviewed based upon estimated future production and when appropriate  reserves are established 
shafts that are designated for rework parts that need additional work are reviewed and when appropriate reserves are established 
the final analysis is to review inactive inventory  and apply reserves to parts that were not included in the other analyses and have been inactive in the system for a period of twelve months 
the co mpany s average reserve percentage compared to gross inventory has been approximately for the past five years 
in the past five years  the highest reserve percentage was approximately and the lowest reserve percentage was approximately 
the company s reserve percentage as of december  is 
see the estimated impact below to cost of goods sold  utilizing the different reserve rates above amounts below in thousands highest average lowest gross inventory as of reserve rate a estimated reserve recorded reserve as of impact to costs of goods sold a this was the company s highest rate  the second highest rate in the past five years was 
in the future  if our inventory were determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure that our forecasts of future product demands are reasonable  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
the company has reduced its gross inventories by from december  through december  in addition  the company has disposed of a significant amount of fully reserved inventories over the past two years 
this has had the effect of reducing the company s reserve percentage against gross inventories 
as such  the company s related inventory reserves have decreased over that same period 
as the company continues to try and reduce its carrying levels of its work in process and finished goods inventory  it should have the effect of further reducing the amount of its inventory reserves 
overview business conditions the company is principally engaged in the business of designing  manufacturing and marketing graphite carbon fiber based composite golf club shafts  with approximately of its net sales resulting from sales to golf club manufacturers for inclusion in their clubs 
as a result  the company s operating results are substantially dependent not only on demand by its customers for the company s shafts  but also on demand by consumers for clubs including graphite shafts such as the company s 
the graphite shaft market consists of oem production shafts  both premium and value  and branded shafts 
the company sells customized oem production shafts directly to its customers and sells aldila branded shafts through the oem custom fit programs and distributors 
the company has re emerged over the past couple of years as an innovator in the branded segment of the business  in which shafts tend to sell at higher prices and gross margins than the standard shafts sold to club manufacturers 
the company introduced its new and innovative one shaft early in  which has been successful in the branded segment and the company introduced the aldila nv tm  in  featuring the company s exclusive micro laminate technology 
the nv tm has had numerous tour victories  including the british open and is currently the number one new shaft model on tour 
in addition to the one and the nv tm shafts  the company continues to develop other premium branded custom shafts and has introduced nv line extensions in  including the nvs  nv protopype  nv extreme and the nv hybrid shafts 
in addition  the company introduced the gamer shaft in the first part of  which will also service the hybrid club segment at a different price point 
the company believes that it will continue to be successful in the branded segment and has focused its marketing and advertising effort in support of this business 
the company competes aggressively with both united states and foreign based shaft manufacturers for oem production shafts 
the company continues to maintain a broad customer base in both the oem production shaft and branded shaft market segments 
during the s  the graphite golf shaft industry became increasingly competitive  placing extraordinary pressure on the selling prices of the company s golf shafts and adversely affecting its gross profit margins and level of profitability 
the company s selling prices decreased through the s and through december  the pressure was mainly attributed to the increased competition for oem production shafts  and a shift of our customers away from branded shafts to customized oem production shafts 
the company s average selling price decreased by from december  through december  the company s average selling price has increased by approximately from through the increase in average selling prices is primarily attributed to the success the company has achieved in the branded segment of the business 
the company believes that its average selling price will increase if it continues to be successful in the branded segment of the golf shaft market 
in addition  increases in carbon fiber prices passed on to its customers will also have the effect of increasing average selling prices in the future 
the company s response to the pricing pressure it has faced and continues to face has been to reduce its cost structure  vertically integrate and to focus on penetration of the branded shaft segment 
the company has reduced its cost structure by shifting more and more of its shaft production offshore  and by manufacturing the majority of its prepreg requirements internally 
in a further effort to reduce costs  the company consolidated its executive offices with its manufacturing facilities in poway  california in the company continues to look for opportunities to cut costs 
the cost saving benefits of its efforts to vertically integrate its operations  particularly through carbon fiber manufacturing  has not benefited the company in the last several years 
until recently market prices for golf shaft raw materials  which are primarily based on carbon fiber costs  have been historically low with carbon fiber readily available at attractive prices when compared to the company s cost to purchase it from cft 
in the second half of the availability of carbon fiber began to decline and prices began to increase  which trend the company believes will continue at least for the foreseeable future 
although the company s gross margins and profitability have continued to be adversely affected through this period despite its efforts  management believes that vertical integration through its prepreg operation has been successful to date and is allowing the company to maintain  or in some cases enhance  its competitive position with respect to the major united states golf club companies that are its principal customers 
in  the company refocused its efforts on the branded shaft segment 
in  the company introduced the aldila one shaft  in the company introduced the nv tm shaft 
in  the company introduced line extensions of the nv 
the company has increased its marketing and advertising spending in support of its branded products 
the company s sales have tended to be concentrated among a limited number of major club companies  thus making the company s results of operations dependent on those customers  their continued willingness to purchase a significant portion of their shafts from the company  and their success in selling clubs containing the company s shafts to their customers 
in  net sales to acushnet company  callaway golf and ping represented  and of the company s net sales  respectively  and the company anticipates that these companies will continue  collectively  to represent the largest portion of its sales in although it is generally difficult to predict in advance the success of any particular club or of any particular manufacturer  the company believes that it is protected to some extent from normal periodic fluctuations in sales among the various golf club companies by virtue of the broad range of its club manufacturer customers 
golf club companies regularly introduce new clubs  frequently containing innovations in design 
sometimes these new clubs achieve dramatic success in the marketplace  thus increasing the overall volatility of club sales among the major companies 
while the company seeks to have its shafts represented on as many major product introductions as possible  it can provide no assurance that its shafts will be included in any particular hot club or that sales of a hot club that does not include the company s shafts will not have a negative impact on the sales of those clubs that do 
the company s sales could also suffer a significant drop off from period to period to the extent that they may be dependent in any period on sales of one or more hot clubs  which then tail off in subsequent periods when no other club offers a high level of new sales to replace the lost sales 
in  the company started manufacturing prepreg  the principal raw material in the manufacture of graphite golf shafts  at its facility in poway  california 
most of its production of prepreg is used internally by the company  with the remainder sold to other composite materials manufacturers 
the company continues to look for opportunities to sell its prepreg to other composite materials manufacturers and to manufacture other non golf composite materials products  such as hockey sticks 
sales of prepreg as a percentage of net revenues increased to in as compared to in and sales of hockey sticks decreased to of net revenues from in although the company has achieved some success in these areas  management continues to believe that the growth opportunities in these areas will be limited  especially as it pertains to other composite products  such as hockey sticks 
management believes that it can continue to improve on its sales of composite prepreg  although it does not anticipate it will be material to its results of operations for at least several years 
in  the company established a manufacturing facility in evanston  wyoming for the production of carbon fiber 
during and through the first ten months of  the company used the material from this facility to satisfy a significant portion of its internal demand for carbon fiber in the manufacturing of golf club shafts 
during  the company also produced and sold carbon fiber from this facility to other unrelated entities for the manufacture of other carbon based products 
on october   sgl purchased a interest in the company s carbon fiber manufacturing operation 
the company and sgl entered into an agreement to operate the facility as a limited liability company with equal ownership interests between the venture members 
the company and sgl also entered into supply agreements with the new entity  cft  for the purchase of carbon fiber at cost plus an agreed upon mark up 
the company and sgl are each responsible to bear of the fixed costs to operate the facility as a term of this supply agreement 
profits and losses of cft are shared equally by the partners 
the carbon fiber from this facility is primarily consumed by the joint venture partners 
if the carbon fiber facility is not operated at high production levels  either because of production difficulties or because there is not enough demand by the joint venture partners to justify that level of production  the cost per unit of carbon fiber consumed by the company and thus the cost of producing the company s golf shafts and other products is increased due to spreading the fixed costs of production over smaller volumes 
if demand is lower than production capacity  cft also runs the risk of building up excess inventory 
given the relatively low costs historically in the market for carbon fiber and the highly competitive market for graphite golf shafts  the failure to operate at high levels could adversely affect the company s gross margins or its ability to maintain competitive prices for its products 
although selling prices of carbon fiber have been depressed for the past several years based on a surplus of supply in the market for carbon fiber  the company has recently seen increases in carbon fiber prices and a constriction of supply of some types of carbon fiber  which are not manufactured at cft 
if the prices continue to increase or if the company cannot obtain an adequate supply at a reasonable price  it could have an adverse affect on the company s business 
the company does not expect third party sales at cft to have a significant effect on either its sales or profitability for several years
