in addition  the company leases some of its administrative and manufacturing facilities 
a complete discussion of properties can be found in part  item at properties 
leases have proven to be an acceptable method for the company to acquire new or replacement equipment and to maintain facilities with a minimum impact on its operating cash flows

of the million in open purchase orders  there are various blanket orders for annual requirements 
actual needs under these blanket purchase orders fluctuate with the company s manufacturing levels

staff accounting bulletin states that revenue generally is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable 
collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company believes that it meets the above criteria for the following reasons customer purchase orders confirming the price and shipping terms are required prior to shipment 
the terms of the company s sales are generally fob shipping point  meaning that the customer takes ownership of the goods and assumes the risk of loss when the goods leave the company s premises 
the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable as noted  we require a customer purchase order  which confirms the price and shipping terms 
collectibility is reasonably assured the credit terms for customers are pre established so that collection of the account can be reasonably assured 
inactive  obsolete and surplus inventory reserve the company reserves for inventories that it deems inactive  obsolete or surplus 
this reserve is calculated based upon the demand for the products that the company produces 
demand is determined by 
table of contents expected sales or customer forecasts 
if expected sales do not materialize  then the company would have inventory in excess of its reserves and would have to charge the excess against future earnings 
in the case where the company has purchased material based upon a customer s forecast  the company is usually covered by lead time assurance agreements with each customer 
these contracts state that the financial liability for material purchased within lead time and based upon the customer s forecasts  lies with the customer 
if the company purchases material outside the lead time assurance agreement and the customer s forecasts do not materialize  the company would have the financial liability and would have to charge any excess obsolete inventory against earnings 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company values its accounts receivable net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is based on estimates of the portion of accounts receivable that may not be collected in the future  and the amount of this allowance is disclosed in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the estimates used are based primarily on specific identification of potentially uncollectible accounts 
such accounts are identified using publicly available information in conjunction with evaluations of current payment activity 
however  if any of the company s customers were to develop unexpected and immediate financial problems that would prevent payment of open invoices  the company could incur additional and possibly material expenses that would negatively impact earnings 
accrued warranty an accrual is made for expected warranty costs  with the related expense recognized in cost of goods sold 
management reviews the adequacy of this accrual quarterly based on historical analysis and anticipated product returns and rework costs 
as the company has made the transition from manufacturing primarily keyboards to primarily ems products  its exposure to warranty claims has declined significantly 
the company s warranty period for keyboards is generally longer than that for ems products 
also the company does not warrant design defects for ems customers

 chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges

is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  and is required to be adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents in march  the fasb issued fin as an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even through uncertainly exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
this interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  the company does not anticipate that the provision of fin will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
risks and uncertainties that could affect future results the following risks and uncertainties could affect the company s actual results and could cause results to differ materially from past results or those contemplated by the company s forward looking statements 
when used herein  the words expects  believes  anticipates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results the company s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary in the future due to a variety of factors  including changes in overall demand for customers products  success of customers programs  timing of new programs  new product introductions or technological advances by the company  its customers and its competitors and changes in pricing policies by the company  its customers  its suppliers and its competitors 
for example  the company relies on customers forecasts to plan its business 
if those forecasts are overly optimistic  the company s revenues and profits may fall short of expectations 
conversely  if those forecasts are too conservative  the company could have an unexpected increase in revenues and profits 
the products which the company manufactures for its customers have relatively short product lifecycles  therefore the company s business  operating results and financial condition are dependent in significant part on the company s ability to obtain orders from new customers and new product programs from existing customers 
competition the ems industry is intensely competitive 
competitors may offer customers lower prices on certain high volume programs 
this could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  all of which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s inability to provide comparable or better manufacturing services at a lower cost than its competitors could cause sales to decline 
in addition  competitors can copy the company s non proprietary designs after the company has invested in development of products for customers  thereby enabling such competitors to offer lower prices on such products due to savings in development costs 
concentration of major customers at present  the company s customer base is highly concentrated and could become even more concentrated 
the company s largest ems customer accounted for of net sales in fiscal year this same customer accounted for of sales in and in for the fiscal years ended   and  the five largest customers accounted for  and of total sales  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the company s principal customers will continue to purchase products from the company at current levels 
moreover  the company typically does not enter into long term volume purchase contracts with its customers  and the company s customers have certain rights to extend or delay the shipment of their orders 
the loss of one or more of the company s major customers  or the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from such customers  could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on suppliers the company is dependent on many suppliers  including sole source suppliers  to provide key components and raw materials used in manufacturing customers products 
delays in deliveries from suppliers or the inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and raw materials could cause delays or reductions in shipment of products to our customers which could adversely affect the company s operating results and damage customer relationships 
dependence on key personnel the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  marketing and management personnel and on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees 
the competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
foreign manufacturing operations virtually all products manufactured by the company are produced at the company s facilities located in mexico and china 
accordingly  the company s operations are subject to a variety of risks unique to international operations including import and export duties and value added taxes  import and export regulation changes  the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws and foreign economic and political risk 

table of contents technological change and new product risk the markets for the company s customers products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and relatively short product life cycles 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
the company s success will depend upon its customers ability to enhance existing products and to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address evolving and increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
failure of the company s customers to do so could substantially harm the company s customers competitive positions 
there can be no assurance that the company s customers will be successful in identifying  developing and marketing products that respond to technological change  emerging industry standards or evolving customer requirements 
compliance with current and future environmental regulation the company is subject to a variety of domestic and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  and disposal of materials used in our manufacturing processes 
if we fail or choose not to comply with any present or future regulations  we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of current manufactured products 
in addition  such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our operations or could require us to acquire costly equipment  substitute materials  or incur other significant expenses to comply with government regulations 
foreign currency fluctuations a significant portion of the company s operations and customers are in foreign locations 
as a result  transactions may occur in currencies other than the us dollar 
exchange rate fluctuations among other currencies used by the company could directly or indirectly affect our financial results 
future currency fluctuations are dependent upon a number of factors and cannot be easily predicted 
the company currently does not use financial instruments to hedge foreign currency fluctuation and unexpected expenses could occur from future fluctuations in exchange rates 
dilution and stock price volatility as of july   there were outstanding options for the purchase of approximately million shares of common stock of the company common stock  of which options for approximately million shares were vested and exercisable 
holders of the common stock will suffer immediate and substantial dilution to the extent outstanding options to purchase the common stock are exercised 
the stock price of the company may be subject to wide fluctuations and possible rapid increases or declines over a short time period 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to the company such as variations in quarterly operating results or changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors relating to the ems and computer industries or to the securities markets in general  which  in recent years  have experienced significant price fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stocks are traded 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business 
the company s major market risk relates to its secured debt 
the company s debt is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
the interest rates applicable to the company s revolving loan fluctuate with the jp morgan chase bank prime rate and libor rates 
the company does not currently enter into derivative transactions or leveraged swap agreements 
although the company has international operations  the functional currency for all active subsidiaries is the us dollar 
the company imports raw materials that are used in its manufacturing operations 
the majority of the company s purchases are denominated in us dollars and are paid under normal trade terms 
the company currently does not hedge the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
