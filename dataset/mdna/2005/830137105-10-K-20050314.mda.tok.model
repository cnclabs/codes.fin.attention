the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations for each of the subsequent five years in thousands s thereafter total fixed rate mortgages convertible subordinated debentures construction contractual obligations the company currently has two long term ground lease obligations at westland shopping center and southwood shopping center

holders of the company s series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock are entitled to receive  when  as and if declared by the board of directors  out of funds legally available for the payment of distributions  preferential cumulative cash distributions at the rate of per annum of the liquidation preference per share equivalent to a fixed annual amount of per share 
distributions on the series b preferred stock will be payable quarterly in arrears on the fifteenth day of february  may  august and november of each year  or  if not a business day  the next succeeding business day 
the board of directors  on february   declared a per share cash distribution  payable on may   to preferred shareholders of record on may  the preferred stock may be redeemed solely at the company s option following the fifth anniversary of the issuance date at the liquidation price of per share plus accrued and unpaid distributions 
the company s current common stock distribution policy is to pay quarterly distributions to shareholders  based upon funds from operations  among other factors  as opposed to net income 
because funds from operations excludes the deduction of non cash charges  principally depreciation of real estate assets  quarterly distributions will typically be greater than net income and may include a tax deferred return of capital component or a capital gain component 
the board of directors  on february   declared a cash distribution with respect to the period october  through december  of per share  to shareholders of record as of february  funds from operations the company defines funds from operations ffo as net income  computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  those items defined as extraordinary under gaap  plus depreciation on real estate assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
ffo is a key operating measure used by management in evaluating operating performance  and trends in operating performance 
management also uses ffo to compare operating performance with other equity reits  particularly those who own retail and residential properties 
the company also considers ffo  as well as other criteria  in evaluating and granting incentive compensation 
the company believes that ffo may also be helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit 
in computing ffo  the company excludes the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains and losses from sales of real estate 
in the company s view  these amounts  which are derived from historical cost  are of limited relevance in evaluating current performance 
the company s experience  and the experience of other owners of shopping centers and apartment communities in the markets in which we operate  is that depreciation and amortization have virtually no correlation with changes in the value of the properties 
real estate assets can also appreciate  rather than depreciate in value over time 

table of contents management believes  however  that ffo  by excluding such items  which can vary among owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  can help compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods as compared to different companies 
the company s ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits 
other reits may not define ffo in a comparable manner or may use different interpretations in the calculation 
the company believes that use of ffo may also facilitate comparisons of operating performance between operating periods and among us and other equity reits 
investors should review ffo  along with gaap net income and other appropriate operating measures and cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities when trying to understand an equity reit s operating performance 
ffo is not a gaap measure or a disclosure required by the securities and exchange commission 
as previously stated  computations of ffo differ among reits 
thus  an investor should be attentive to differences in ffo computations when comparing ffo among reits 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund cash needs  including the ability to make cash distributions 
a reconciliation of net income to basic ffo is presented below in thousands year ended december dollars shares dollars shares dollars shares net income additions depreciation and amortization partnership depreciation deductions gain on sale of real estate minority depreciation preferred dividends funds from operations available to common shareholders for the year ended december   ffo available to common stock decreased approximately million to million  compared to million in primarily due to hurricane damages expenses of approximately for the year ended december   ffo available to common shareholders decreased approximately million to million  compared to million in the decrease was primarily attributable to increased real estate taxes  property insurance costs  utilities and general and administrative expenses  as well as the payout of preferred distributions  partially offset by increased revenues and decreased interest expense 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial status depends 
we determined the critical principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition 
certain of our operating leases for retail space contain contingent rent provisions under which tenants are required to pay a percentage of their sales in excess of a specified target amount  or breakpoint  as additional rent 
we defer recognition of percentage rent until those specified targets are met 
real estate investments 
we apply financial accounting standards board statement statement to measure impairment in long lived assets 
rental properties are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis from a rental property is less than its historical net cost basis 
these expected future cash flows consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors on occupancy 
upon determination that a permanent impairment has occurred  rental properties are reduced to their fair value 
for properties to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the property  less the estimated cost to sell  is less than the carrying amount of the property measured at the time there is a commitment to sell 
table of contents the property and or it is actively being marketed for sale 
a property to be disposed of is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value  less its cost to sell 
subsequent to the date that a property is held for disposition  depreciation expense is not recorded 
the company has no impaired properties 
accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january the company was required to apply fin r to variable interests in variable interest entities vies by march  the adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  as the company did not have variable interest entities 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
affects the issuer s accounting for three types of freestanding financial instruments 
one type is mandatory redeemable shares  which the issuing company is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash or other assets 
a second type  which includes put options and forward purchase contracts  involves instruments that do or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets 
the third type of instrument that is a liability under this statement is an obligation that can be settled with shares  the monetary value of which is fixed  tied solely or predominantly to a variable such as a market index  or varies inversely with the value of the issuer s shares 
sfas no 
does not apply to features embedded in a financial instrument that is not a derivative in its entirety 
most of the guidance in sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on the company s financial statements 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends fas no 
 the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of fas no 
to stock based employee compensation 
the pro forma data presented below is not representative of the effects on reported amounts for future years 
as reported proforma results net income available to common shareholders net income per common share no new options were granted in or for grants in  the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes pricing model based on the following assumptions risk free interest rate expected life years years volatility dividend yield in december  the fasb revised its sfas no 
sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation 
the revision establishes standards for the accounting of transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  particularly transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the revised statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is to be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
changes in fair value during the requisite service period are to be recognized as compensation cost over that period 
in addition  the revised statement amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  to require that excess tax benefits to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid 
the provisions of the revised statement are 
table of contents effective for financial statements issued for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the company is currently evaluating the impact that this statement will have on its financial condition or results of operations 
future results this form k and other documents prepared and statements made by the company may contain certain forward looking statements that are subject to risk and uncertainty 
investors and potential investors in the company s securities are cautioned that a number of factors could adversely affect the company and cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including  but not limited to a the inability to lease current or future vacant space in the company s properties  b decisions by tenants and anchor tenants who own their space to close stores at the company s properties  c the inability of tenants to pay rent and other expenses  d tenant financial difficulties  e general economic and world conditions  including threats to the united states homeland from unfriendly factions  f decreases in rental rates available from tenants  g increases in operating costs at the company s properties  h increases in corporate operating costs associated with new regulatory requirements  i lack of availability of financing for acquisition  development and rehabilitation of properties by the company  j force majeure as it relates to construction and rehabilitation projects  k possible dispositions of mature properties since the company is continuously engaged in the examination of its various lines of business  l increases in interest rates  m a general economic downturn resulting in lower retail sales and causing downward pressure on occupancies and rents at retail properties  n forces of nature  o the adverse tax consequences if the company were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  and p inability of the company to implement its strategic initiatives for foregoing or other reasons

effects of inflation inflation has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our properties 
substantially all of the company s retail leases contain provisions designed to provide the company with a hedge against inflation 
most of the company s retail leases contain provisions which enable the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenant sales in excess of a stated breakpoint and or provide for periodic increases in minimum rent during the lease term 
the majority of the company s retail leases are for terms of less than ten years  which allows the company to adjust rentals to changing market conditions 
in addition  most retail leases require tenants to pay a contribution towards property operating expenses  thereby reducing the company s exposure to higher operating costs caused by inflation 
the company s apartment leases are written for short terms  generally six to twelve months  and are adjusted according to changing market conditions 
these factors reduce the company s exposure to increased cost and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its bank lines of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity  fund capital expenditures  operations and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows  and to optimize its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objective  the company utilizes its variable libor based  short term one to six month maturities bank credit lines to fund the development and acquisition of new investments until such investments can be financed with long term fixed rate non recourse mortgage debt 
at december   borrowings under the company s bank lines of credit totaled million and bore an average interest rate of 
the carrying amounts of these instruments approximate fair value because they are short term and therefore utilize interest rates which are adjusted to market at maturity 
based on the balance of bank lines of credit outstanding at december  and the average interest rate at year end  each basis point increase in variable interest rates would increase the company s interest expense in by approximately  conversely  each basis point decrease in variable interest rates would decrease the company s interest expense in by a like amount 
as the bank lines of credit are obligations that existed as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during such future period and the level of interest rates at that time 
at december   the company had mortgage debt totaling million with an average interest rate of
