item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a leading provider of information technology it and business process outsourcing bpo services to corporate and government clients around the world 
in addition to our core it and bpo operations  we own at kearney  a high value management consultancy 
this section provides an overview of our progress on the initiatives we outlined at the beginning of  the principal factors and events that impacted our results and the principal risks and opportunities we anticipate going forward 
this discussion refers to our core it and bpo operations  except where we specifically refer to at kearney 
highlights progress on initiatives at the beginning of we stated that our priorities for the year were to continue to stabilize and improve our core business  strengthen our balance sheet and expand our bpo and transformation capabilities 
this discussion outlines our progress on each of these initiatives 
stabilize and improve core business 
our efforts to stabilize and improve our core it outsourcing business have focused on stabilizing problem contracts  accelerating our cost reduction initiatives and improving our win rate with prospective clients 
in we made significant progress in stabilizing the problem contracts that have adversely impacted our earnings and cash flow since late  including the two contracts that generated the greatest losses during this period our navy marine corps intranet nmci contract and the contract we have referred to as the other commercial contract 
we continued to incur significant losses under both the nmci contract and the other commercial contract in and progress on the nmci contract in particular was slower than anticipated  resulting in a million non cash impairment charge in the third quarter for long lived assets used on the contract 
however  we expect significant reductions in the rate of operating losses under this contract in as described in more detail below 
in addition  during the year we reached an agreement to terminate the other commercial contract 
further information regarding the nmci contract and the other commercial contract is set forth below 
during  we reduced our cost of revenues which excludes selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses by approximately billion principally through labor cost management  productivity initiatives and improved sourcing  as well as expense reductions achieved due to contract terminations 
these cost reduction efforts represent the initial steps of our long term goal to reduce our cost of revenues by approximately compared to levels  as described below under priorities and expectations for and beyond 
in connection with these efforts  in october we announced additional elements of a comprehensive workforce management program to ensure we have the mix of skills required to meet client needs 
the program included a voluntary early retirement offer ero for eligible us based employees 
approximately  employees accepted the ero in to cover costs of this program  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of approximately million of that charge relates to cash payments  primarily in related to the continuation of healthcare benefits  with the remainder related to increased pension liabilities and accelerated vesting of equity compensation 
strengthen balance sheet 
during we improved our unrestricted cash and marketable securities position to approximately billion at year end from approximately billion at the end of and reduced long term debt outstanding to billion from billion at december  in addition  we replaced and extended our revolving credit and secured accounts receivable  or a r  facilities  and had approximately billion available under these facilities at the end of our total liquidity  defined as unrestricted cash and marketable securities plus borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities  increased to approximately billion at december  compared to billion at december  the improvement in our cash position during the year was due to the generation of approximately billion from the divestiture of non core assets  principally the sale of our ugs plm solutions business in the second quarter  and approximately million of free cash flow 
we refer you to liquidity and capital resources below for a definition and further discussion of free cash flow 
our improved cash position allowed us the flexibility to repurchase on november  the million of financial assets from the securitization trust which we had previously used to finance the purchase of capital assets for our nmci contract 
we refer you to off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations below for a discussion of this facility 
our free cash flow for reflected approximately million generated by our operations  excluding nmci  offset by cash usage of approximately million for the nmci contract  not including the discretionary million repurchase of financial assets 
expand bpo and transformational capabilities 
a key element of our strategy is to focus on growing our bpo and business transformation capabilities and providing greater value add services for our clients total business 
the transformation capabilities we acquired through the acquisition of the feld group  inc in january have enabled us to provide greater value add services to clients 
in january  we announced the creation of a joint venture with towers perrin to deliver a comprehensive range of human resource hr bpo services 
the joint venture  known as excelleratehro llp and owned by eds  commenced operations on march  excelleratehro combines eds payroll and related hr outsourcing business with the pension  health and welfare administration services business formerly operated by towers perrin as its tpas business 
the new company enables us to offer a comprehensive set of hr outsourcing solutions across the core areas of benefits  payroll  compensation management  workforce administration and relocation  recruitment and staffing  and workforce development 
nmci we provide end to end it infrastructure on a seat management basis to the department of navy the don  which includes the us navy and marine corps  under a contract that has been extended through september seats are ordered on a governmental fiscal year basis  which runs from october through september at december   we had approximately  computer seats under management that were then billable  and approximately  of these seats had been transitioned or cutover to the new environment 
amounts to be billed per seat are based on the type of seat ordered 
in addition  certain milestones must be met before we can bill at a price equal to the full seat price included in the pricing schedule 
according to that schedule  seats under management are generally billed at a price of of the associated full seat price until certain service performance levels as defined in the contract are satisfied 
upon meeting such service levels  seats operating under the nmci environment are billed at a price equal to of the full seat price while those operating under the pre existing  or legacy  network environment continue to be billed at a price equal to of the full seat price 
on september   we reached an agreement with the don to modify service performance levels and to revise certain contract terms related to performance and customer satisfaction incentives effective october  the new agreement also allowed for incremental billing related to service level agreement sla performance in the period june to september  with an increment of of the full seat price billed for eligible cutover seats 
as of december   no seats had been billed at  however some seats had incremental billings at 
based on the timing of the finalization of the performance measurements for the period october to december  we expect to bill in early the incremental of seat price with respect to such period for those seats achieving the required service performance levels during the period 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in the third quarter of to write down nmci contract related long lived assets to estimated fair value 
the impairment charge is reported as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statement of operations 
fair value was measured by probability weighting future contract pre tax cash flows discounted at a pre tax risk free discount rate 
assumptions to which probability factors were applied in determining pre tax cash flows include items such as sla performance  customer satisfaction and other incentives  new business  claims  legacy billings  and the three year contract extension 
the decline in the fair value of these assets is primarily a result of lower estimates of future revenues as a result of several events occurring during the third quarter 
these events include a revision of the timeline for meeting modified performance service levels  a deceleration in customer satisfaction improvement rates  delays in signing certain contract modifications and additions  and the failure to meet seat cutover schedules during the quarter 
remaining long lived assets and lease receivables associated with the contract totaled approximately million and million  respectively  at december  if we do not maintain or exceed current monthly seat cutover rates  or if we do not meet service performance and customer satisfaction levels defined by the agreement signed on september  in accordance with anticipated timelines  estimates of future contract cash flows will continue to decline 
we continue to pursue several opportunities to improve the financial performance of this contract  including efforts to increase the average seat price  obtain compensation for services provided to the client including services related to legacy applications  ensure minimum order obligations under the contract  qualify for performance and customer satisfaction incentives under the contract  improve productivity  extend the contract term through the don s optional three year extension period  and seek additional business with this client 
in addition  we expect to recover a significant portion of our investment in this contract through the sale of nmci infrastructure and desktop assets to the client at the end of the contract term 
during  we incurred operating losses associated with the nmci contract of million  exclusive of the million impairment charge referred to above 
free cash flow usage for the year was million  exclusive of the million financial asset repurchase referred to above 
for  we incurred operating losses under this contract of million excluding a deferred contract cost write off of million 
free cash flow usage for was million 
the increase in certain operating losses in compared to is due to the deferral of certain costs throughout associated with the construction of nmci infrastructure 
such costs were deemed to be impaired as of december   and were charged to expense 
similar costs were charged to expense as incurred in this increase in expense is partially offset by increased billings associated with additional seats under management 
although we continue to have a number of opportunities to improve the performance of the nmci contract over the longer term as discussed above  we also face a number of significant risks  including those referred to above as well as the factors that resulted in the impairment of assets in the third quarter of due to the significant adverse impact this contract has had on our earnings and free cash flow  we intend to disclose our earnings and cash flow from this contract separately from our other operations for the foreseeable future 
see factors that may affect future results below 
other commercial contract we have previously referred to a significant commercial contract under which we provided various it services using the legacy it systems acquired from the client while developing and deploying a new it system dedicated to that client 
this contract experienced delays in its development and construction phases  and milestones in the contract had been missed 
in july  we reached an agreement with the client to terminate the existing contract effective august   provide transition services for a limited period thereafter and settle each party s outstanding claims 
as of december   no significant services were being provided under this agreement  nor do we expect any future services to be significant 
during  we recognized pre tax charges of million to write down certain assets to fair value 
in addition  we recognized a million pre tax charge during to record contract related vendor commitments and employee severance obligations associated with the contract 
all of the aforementioned amounts associated with this contract are included in cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and are reflected in the results of the outsourcing segment 
in addition to these charges  we incurred contract operating losses of million in compared to operating losses of million in us airways bankruptcy we provide it services to us airways through a long term agreement 
in september  us airways filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
the us airways contract represented approximately million of our revenues 
due to uncertainties regarding recoverability of pre bankruptcy receivables associated with this contract  we recorded net charges totaling million during this amount is reflected in cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
at december   we had equipment and other assets with a net book value of approximately million deployed on the us airways services agreement 
in addition  we may have outstanding receivables under this agreement at any one time of up to approximately million 
if us airways is not successful in emerging from bankruptcy proceedings and ceases operations  all or a significant portion of these assets and any post bankruptcy receivables will become impaired 
disposition of ugs plm solutions on may   we completed the disposition of our ugs plm solutions subsidiary for billion 
the net results of ugs plm solutions  including a gain on sale of million million net of tax  are included in income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
priorities and expectations for and beyond our progress in stabilizing and improving our core business and strengthening our balance sheet since enables us to shift our focus to a longer term strategy 
this strategy contemplates significant new investments in our infrastructure and in new service offerings intended to improve our cost competitiveness and generate future growth 
although we believe this strategy will result in longer term revenue and earnings growth  the impact of these investments  together with the impact of previous contract terminations and renegotiations  will adversely impact our earnings in we expect  however  that much of that impact  however  will be offset by the benefits of productivity improvements undertaken in and improved operating results of problem contracts 
in we expect to make significant new investments in our infrastructure and in new service offerings intended to improve our cost competitiveness and generate future growth 
this includes investment in expanding our hr bpo capabilities  principally through the creation of our owned joint venture with towers perrin discussed above and additional investment in that business and our other bpo offerings 
the acquisition of towers perrin s benefits administration business was completed in the first quarter of the approximately million in cash we paid at closing of the transaction which principally represented the purchase price for the business and the right to use the towers perrin brand  net of towers perrin s interest in the new company and its share of the cash capital contribution approximately million to the venture was funded from cash on hand 
in addition  we expect to invest or spend approximately million to improve cost competitiveness in our core business through a more scaleable and streamlined infrastructure and workforce  and approximately million in technology related to our next generation of agile enterprise offerings 
we will continue to focus on improving our cost competitiveness in as part of our long term goal to reduce our cost structure excluding sg a expense by approximately compared to levels 
our key initiatives for include the following continued improvements in our supply chain through better leveraging of the size of our company and the benefits of increased standardization  continuation of labor cost management through increased investment in automation and monitoring tools  use of our best shore sm delivery capabilities and consolidation of existing solution centre locations  enterprise process improvements through reduced variability and greater standardization  and production process improvements through improved utilization of data center capacity 
in addition  we are reviewing alternatives to allow us to maximize the value of at kearney  including the possibility of allowing at kearney principals to obtain an ownership stake in the business 
however  no decision has been made as to whether to proceed with a transaction that reduces our ownership interest in this business or as to the nature of such transaction  and there is no assurance that we will consummate any such transaction 
as a result of a comprehensive review of our space requirements  we believe approximately of our space is underutilized 
in connection with our efforts to improve competitiveness and enhance workplace capacity usage  we expect to vacate a significant number of our owned and leased properties over the next three years through sales of owned real estate and subleasing space at certain leased locations or exiting those locations at lease expiration 
we expect revenues of approximately billion  which would represent a decline in organic revenues of from this reflects an anticipated decrease in revenues from contracts terminated in including the uk inland revenue contract and other commercial contract and a continued decrease in gm revenues  offset in part by an increase in revenue under the nmci contract 
we refer you to results of operations below for a definition of organic revenues 
our earnings per share in will be impacted by several factors 
we expect earnings to be positively impacted by the productivity initiatives described above  improvements in our core business estimated impact of per share and reduced interest and other expense estimated impact of per share 
however  earnings will be negatively impacted by run off of existing business estimated impact of per share  the previously reported pension charge related to the termination of our uk inland revenue account estimated impact of per share  severance expense related to our labor cost management efforts estimated impact of per share and expenses attributable to funding the investments in our business described above estimated impact of per share from investments in bpo capabilities  per share from infrastructure investments and per share from technology investments 
we currently expect earnings of approximately per share excluding the estimated per share incremental impact of the expensing of stock options and other long term incentive awards described below  comprised of earnings from our core operations excluding nmci of per share and a loss of approximately per share from nmci 
we expect free cash flow in of approximately to million  comprised of an estimated to billion of free cash flow from our core operations excluding nmci  before the million of cash usage for investments in the business and severance expense as described above  and estimated free cash flow usage for the nmci contract between and million  assuming seats are cutover within expected timeframes at their planned rate and billed at of the seat price within expected timeframes 
we expect the operating performance of our nmci contract to improve from a loss of per share in to a loss of approximately per share in  driven by productivity improvements and the commencement of billing for the majority of cutover seats at of seat price 
we expect this contract will no longer generate operating losses beginning in the latter half of the year 
we expect free cash flow for this contract to improve from cash usage of million in excluding the million repurchase of the nmci financial assets referred to above to estimated cash usage of between and million 
an estimated million of that improvement will be driven by improved lease collections resulting from the repurchase of the financial assets ie  lease receivables with the remainder driven by improvements in the performance of that contract 
in addition to focusing on operational improvements to the contract  a key element of management s strategy is to recoup a significant portion of the capital already invested in this contract 
the term of our msa with gm expires in june  and we expect gm to commence a re compete process in covering substantially all of the work we currently perform 
gm continues to be our largest single client  accounting for approximately billion  or approximately  of total revenue in however  our gm revenues have steadily decreased in both dollar terms and as a percentage of our total revenue on an annual basis since our split off from gm in although we expect to retain a significant portion of our current gm business following the re compete  we anticipate our free cash flow from this client will further decrease following termination of the msa in june however  we expect improvement in the free cash flow generated by our nmci contract during this period to more than offset the anticipated decrease in free cash flow from gm 
see factors that may affect future results below for a discussion of the potential impact on our revenue and earnings related to termination of our current msa with gm 
see total contract value of contract signings below for a discussion of our expectations for new contract signings for we intend to adopt the new accounting standard requiring the expensing of stock options effective january  we estimate the expensing of currently outstanding options would have reduced earnings by approximately per share and will reduce earnings by approximately per share 
in addition  the compensation and benefits committee of our board of directors has conducted a comprehensive review of our long term incentive award strategy 
as a result of this review  which considered among other factors the impact of these new accounting rules  we expect the committee to significantly limit the use of annual stock option grants and instead provide annual grants of performance vesting restricted stock units performance rsus 
we expect to continue to use stock options as a component of the long term incentive compensation of our senior executives along with performance rsus  and to completely replace the use of stock options in favor of performance rsus for all other incentive plan participants 
this change is expected to commence with the long term incentive grant in march the vesting of the performance rsus is expected to be tied to our performance as measured by operating margin  net asset utilization and organic revenue growth over multiple year periods 
we estimate this change in our long term incentive compensation strategy will reduce earnings by approximately per share 
we refer you to new accounting standards below for a further discussion of the impact of this new accounting standard 
in march  a consortium led by eds was awarded a ten year contract for the first increment of the united kingdom ministry of defence project to consolidate numerous existing information networks into a single next generation infrastructure the defence information infrastructure future project 
we expect to begin work under this contract in april due to the size of this contract and the up front expenditures and capital investment required  this contract will have a material impact on our estimates for revenue  earnings  free cash flow and total contract value of new business signings set forth in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which do not reflect the impact of this contract 
we intend to update these estimates to reflect such impact in connection with the release of our first quarter earnings 
the estimates for financial performance set forth in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations rely on management s current assumptions  including assumptions concerning future events  and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors  many of which are outside the control of management  that could cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates 
for a discussion of certain of these factors  we refer you to the discussion under factors that may affect future results and cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements below 
accounting changes during the third quarter of  we adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  on a cumulative basis as of january  the adoption of eitf resulted in a non cash adjustment of billion  net of tax  resulting primarily from the reversal of unbilled revenue associated with our it service contracts which we had been accounting for using the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition 
the adjustment also reflects the deferral and subsequent amortization of system construction costs which were previously expensed as incurred and included in the percentage of completion model for the respective contracts 
we refer you to results of operations below for additional information related to the adoption of this new accounting standard 
the adoption of eitf changed the way we recognize revenue and certain expenses on our services contracts 
the new method of revenue recognition results in a closer alignment of results of operations with the cash flows generated by our contracts 
eitf did not allow the restatement of prior period results  however  the results of operations discussion below presents selected financial information on a pro forma basis as if the accounting change had been applied to all of our contracts from contract inception 
in addition  the discussion contained in that section is based upon and reported results and historical pro forma results for we believe the adoption of eitf on a cumulative rather than prospective basis enhances the transparency of our financial statements 
total contract value of contract signings a key metric used by management to monitor new business activity is the total contract value  or tcv  of our contract signings 
there are no third party standards or requirements governing the calculation of tcv 
the tcv of a client contract represents our estimate at contract signing of the total revenue expected over the term of that contract 
contract signings include contracts with new clients and renewals  extensions and add on business with existing clients 
tcv does not include potential revenues that could be earned from a client relationship as a result of future expansion of service offerings to that client  nor does it reflect option years under non governmental contracts that are subject to client discretion 
tcv reflects a number of management estimates and judgments regarding the contract  including assumptions regarding demand driven usage  scope of work and client requirements 
in addition  our contracts may be subject to currency fluctuations and  for contracts with the us federal government  annual funding constraints and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity characteristics 
accordingly  the tcv we report should not be considered firm orders or predictive of future operating results 
the following table presents the tcv of contract signings  including contracts signed by at kearney but excluding contracts signed by ugs plm solutions  by quarter for the last five years in billions first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year the tcv of signings in was approximately billion 
although this was a increase compared to the prior year  our tcv did not meet our forecast 
we expect the tcv of signings in to increase at a roughly similar rate compared to  excluding the impact of the uk ministry of defence contract referred to above 
the tcv of contract signings can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on a number of factors  including the timing of significant new and renewal contracts and the length of those contracts 
the tcv of our signings in and was significantly lower than that reported for each of the prior three years 
in addition  the tcv of our signings in and was lower than our revenues during those years 
this decrease in tcv of signings has negatively impacted our revenues since and will continue to impact our revenues in  as a significant portion of our revenue is generated by long term it services contracts 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will be dependent on our ability to increase the tcv of contract signings to a level significantly higher than that of and we refer you to the discussion of revenues in results of operations below 
results of operations from time to time  we present information regarding our net income and margins excluding the impact of certain quantified special items  in addition to presenting such information on a gaap basis 
net income and margins excluding such items are non gaap financial measures and are disclosed to investors to facilitate comparisons of business performance across periods 
this information is also used by management to facilitate comparisons of business performance across periods and relative to internal targets 
during the third quarter of  we adopted the provisions of eitf on a cumulative basis as of january  eitf modified the application of existing contract accounting literature followed by us prior to that date 
eitf governs how to identify whether goods or services  or both  to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately 
in most circumstances  eitf also limits the recognition of revenue in excess of amounts billed eg  unbilled revenue to the amount that would be received if the client contract were terminated for any reason 
the adoption of eitf resulted in a non cash adjustment reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of billion billion before tax 
the adjustment resulted primarily from the reversal of unbilled revenue associated with our it service contracts which had been accounted for as a single unit using the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition 
the reversal resulted from the fact that typical termination provisions of an it service contract do not provide for the recovery of unbilled revenue in the event the contract is terminated for our nonperformance 
the adjustment also reflects the deferral and subsequent amortization of system construction costs 
these costs were previously expensed as incurred and included in the percentage of completion model for the respective contracts 
see application of critical accounting policies for further discussion of revenue recognition 
the following table reflects financial information for the year ended december  and as reported in our financial statements  and selected financial information on a pro forma basis for the year ended december  as if the aforementioned accounting change had been applied to all contracts at inception in millions  except per share amounts as reported pro forma operating results revenues cost of revenues operating income loss other income expense provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations cumulative effect on prior years of changes in accounting principles  net of income taxes net income loss per share data basic earnings per share of common stock income loss from continuing operations net income loss diluted earnings per share of common stock income loss from continuing operations net income loss weighted average shares outstanding basic diluted revenues 
the following table displays revenues from contracts with our base non gm clients and revenues from gm as reported in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and the table reflects the financial information on an as reported and comparable pro forma basis as if the accounting changes discussed above had been applied to all contracts at inception in millions base revenues as reported pro forma impact of accounting changes as reported pro forma gm revenues as reported pro forma impact of accounting changes as reported pro forma total revenues as reported pro forma impact of accounting changes as reported pro forma the following table displays our revenue growth percentages calculated using revenues as reported in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december  and and on a comparable pro forma basis for  and further adjusted for the impact of foreign currency translation  acquisitions and those divestitures not accounted for as discontinued operations organic revenue growth total base gm growth in as reported pro forma revenues impact of foreign currency changes constant currency revenue growth impact of acquisitions impact of divestitures organic revenue growth constant currency revenue growth is calculated by removing from as reported pro forma revenues the impact of the change in exchange rates between the local currency and the us dollar from the current period and the comparable prior period 
organic revenue growth further excludes revenue growth due to acquisitions in the period presented if the comparable prior period had no revenues from the same acquisition  and revenue decreases due to businesses divested in the period presented or the comparable prior period 
vs 
the decrease in base organic revenues in was primarily attributable to a million  or  decrease in our outsourcing segment and a million  or  decrease in our nmci segment 
the decrease in the outsourcing segment was attributable to an million  or  decrease in the americas unit  a million  or  decrease in europe  middle east and africa emea and a million  or  decrease in the us government unit 
the decrease in revenues in the nmci segment was associated with lower product sales which were partially offset by increased service revenue 
the decrease in base organic revenues in the americas unit was primarily due to contracts with manufacturing clients and contracts with clients in canada 
this decrease was offset by an increase in revenues from contracts with communications and financial services clients 
the decrease in base organic revenues in emea in was primarily due to the termination of our contract with the uk government s inland revenue department effective june   and was offset by an increase in revenues from financial services and other government clients 
the us government business experienced reduced revenues in due to runoff from our state and local business  including the termination of the medicaid contract with the state of texas early in the first quarter 
the decrease in revenues from our state and local business was offset by an increase in revenues from us federal government contracts 
see total contract value of contract signings under overview above for a discussion of the impact of the tcv of our contract signings on revenue in and the anticipated impact in the decrease in organic revenues from gm in was principally due to reduced pricing under the msa as well as gm s move towards a multi vendor strategy 
we expect these trends to continue over the remaining term of our msa with gm which expires in june vs 
the increase in base organic revenues in was primarily attributable to our outsourcing segment which had organic revenue growth of approximately million  or  in approximately million of that increase was attributable to the us government unit  of which million was attributable to the nmci contract 
the remaining increase in base revenues in was primarily attributable to contracts in europe  partially offset by a decrease in revenues of million in our at kearney subsidiary 
the decrease in revenues from gm in was primarily the result of gm s reduction in discretionary it spending as well as the impact of the renegotiation of the gmna  gmac and global mainframe compute sector agreements completed in the second half of gross margin 
the following table displays our gross margin percentages

our gross margin in was adversely affected by asset write downs and operating losses on the nmci contract basis points  and operating losses and other charges on our other commercial contract basis points 
our gross margin in was adversely affected by asset write downs and operating losses on the nmci contract basis points and operating losses on our other commercial contract basis points  and was favorably impacted by a million basis point reversal of mci receivable reserves 
vs 
our gross margin in and was adversely affected by operating losses and the write down of deferred costs on the nmci contract 
the nmci contract had a basis point negative impact on our gross margin percentage and a basis point negative impact on our gross margin percentage adjusted on a pro forma basis for accounting changes 
our gross profit in was favorably impacted by a million basis point reversal of mci receivable reserves and lower operating losses on the other commercial contract discussed above basis points 
our gross profit in was adversely affected by receivable reserves and asset write downs related to our contractual relationships with mci and us airways  both of which filed for bankruptcy during the third quarter of such reserves and asset write downs had a basis point negative impact on our reported gross margin and on our gross margin adjusted on a pro forma basis for accounting changes 
our gross margin in was also negatively impacted by declines in our gm business basis points  additional annual pension and healthcare costs basis points  increased software costs basis points and an increase in costs related to current initiatives for future productivity basis points 
the remaining decrease in our gross margin in was primarily due to declines in higher margin discretionary it applications spending by our clients as a result of general economic conditions and an increasingly competitive environment 
we are implementing global productivity initiatives in connection with our restructuring activities described below 
we expect these efforts to somewhat offset the impact on gross margins from the factors described above 
in addition  our gross margin in the first half of will be adversely impacted by the recognition of a loss on the final settlement of our pension obligations associated with the transition of our uk inland revenue workforce to that client s new service provider 
we refer you to note of our consolidated financial statements for further information 
selling  general and administrative 
sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
the percentage was after adjusting the results on a pro forma basis for the impact of accounting changes 
the increase in the percentage compared to was due to the decrease in constant currency revenues in the decrease in the percentage compared with the pro forma percentage is primarily due to the restructuring initiatives implemented in restructuring and other 
the following table summarizes restructuring and other charges incurred for the years ended december   and in millions restructuring and other employee reduction activities employee separation and exit costs asset write downs ceo severance other activities pre tax gain on disposal of businesses us wireless clearing automotive retail group credit union industry group other total during  we continued initiatives to align our workforce with customer demands and utilize technology to generate efficiencies 
as a result  restructuring and other expense includes estimated severance costs of million related to the involuntary termination of an estimated  employees throughout the company in managerial  professional  clerical  consulting and technical positions 
in addition  restructuring and other expense also includes estimated pension expenses of million related to an early retirement offer in the us to an estimated  employees 
while we plan to continue our efforts to generate efficiencies through technology driven initiatives in  no future costs are expected to be incurred associated with initiatives implemented during during  we began implementation of an initiative to reduce our costs  streamline our organizational structure and exit certain operating activities 
these efforts were designed to improve our cost competitiveness and involved the elimination of excess capacity  primarily in europe  and the consolidation of back office capabilities 
we completed the initiative in as a result of the initiative  we recorded restructuring charges of million and million during and  respectively 
in addition  we recorded asset write downs of million during while we plan to continue our efforts to generate efficiencies through technology driven initiatives in  no future costs are expected to be incurred associated with initiatives implemented during during  we sold our us wireless clearing business and our automotive retail group arg which resulted in pre tax gains of million 
during  we sold our credit union industry group cuig which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
the gains resulting from the sales of the us wireless clearing  arg and cuig are included in restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations 
the net results of the us wireless clearing business  arg and cuig are not included in discontinued operations due to our level of continuing involvement as an it service provider to the businesses

income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  was million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and discontinued operations is comprised primarily of our ugs plm solutions subsidiary sold during the second quarter of discontinued operations also includes our european technology solutions business sold during the fourth quarter of  our subscription fulfillment business sold during the second quarter of and our consumer network services unit sold during the fourth quarter of income from discontinued operations includes a net after tax gain loss on sale of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net income loss 
income loss from continuing operations was million per share in compared with million per share in and million per basic share and per diluted share in net income loss was million in compared with  million in and  million in basic earnings loss per share was in compared with and in diluted earnings loss per share was in compared with in and in in addition to the previously disclosed adoption of accounting changes associated with eitf  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  effective january  sfas no 
requires that the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the majority of our retirement obligations relate to leases which require the facilities be restored to original condition at the expiration of the leases 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a reduction of income reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million million after tax 
additionally  the fair value of the liability recorded on january  was million 
segment information 
we refer you to note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of certain financial information related to our reportable segments for  and  as well as certain financial information related to our operations by geographical regions for such years 
financial position at december   we held cash and marketable securities of billion  had working capital of billion  and had a current ratio current assets current liabilities of to this compares to cash and marketable securities of billion  working capital of million  and a current ratio of to at december  the increase in cash and marketable securities in resulted primarily from the sale of our ugs plm solutions subsidiary which generated gross proceeds of approximately billion 
the improvement in our current ratio was primarily due to the sale of ugs plm solutions and the exchange of cash and common stock for certain outstanding debt securities 
see notes and of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the sale of ugs plm solutions and the debt exchange 
approximately of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  were not available for debt repayment due to various commercial limitations on the use of these assets 
days sales outstanding for trade receivables were days at december  compared to days at december  days sales outstanding were days at december  compared with days at december  after including other financial assets related to certain collections for the nmci contract and work in process related to our at kearney subsidiary 
the increase in days sales outstanding was primarily due to the loss of the inland revenue contract in and the decline in the us dollar relative to other currencies during days payable outstanding were days at december  and total debt was billion at december  versus billion at december  total debt consists of notes payable and capital leases 
the total debt to capital ratio which includes total debt and minority interests as components of capital was at december  compared to at december  the decrease in total debt and our debt to capital ratio in was primarily due to the exchange of cash and common stock for certain outstanding debt securities and debt repayment 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the debt exchange 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations during  we established a securitization facility under which we financed the purchase of capital assets for our nmci contract 
under the terms of the facility  we sold certain financial assets resulting from that contract to a trust trust classified as a qualifying special purpose entity for accounting purposes 
at december   the trust had external borrowings of million and our beneficial interest was million 
during  we completed agreements with the trust s lenders to repurchase financial assets for million in cash 
upon completion of the transaction  we recognized current lease receivables of million and non current lease receivables of million associated with this purchase 
in connection with certain service contracts  we may arrange a client supported financing transaction csft with our client and an independent third party financial institution or its designee 
the use of these transactions enables us to offer clients more favorable financing terms 
these transactions also enable the preservation of our capital and allow us to avoid client credit risk relating to the repayment of the financed amounts 
under these transactions  the independent third party financial institution finances the purchase of certain it related assets and simultaneously leases those assets for use in connection with the service contract 
the use of a csft on a service contract results in lower contract revenue and expense to eds over the contract term 
in csft transactions  client payments are made directly to the financial institution providing the financing 
if the client does not make the required payments under the service contract  under no circumstances do we have an ultimate obligation to acquire the underlying assets unless our nonperformance under the service contract would permit its termination  or we fail to comply with certain customary terms under the financing agreements  including  for example  covenants we have undertaken regarding the use of the assets for their intended purpose 
we consider the possibility of our failure to comply with any of these terms to be remote 
at december   the estimated future asset purchases to be financed under existing arrangements were million 
the aggregate dollar values of assets purchased under our csft arrangements were million  million and million during  and  respectively 
as of december   there were outstanding an aggregate of million under csfts yet to be paid by our clients 
in the event a client contract is terminated due to nonperformance  we would be required to acquire only those assets associated with the outstanding amounts for that contract 
net of repayments  the estimated future maximum amount outstanding under existing financing arrangements is not expected to exceed million 
we believe we have sufficient alternative sources of capital to directly finance the purchase of capital assets to be used for our current and future client contracts without the use of these arrangements 
the following table summarizes csft and securitization financing activities since we began using these arrangements in in millions total csft securiti zation total estimated draws under financings arranged  net of expirations estimated amounts not yet drawn total amounts drawn amounts repaid total outstanding at december  performance guarantees 
in the normal course of business  we may provide certain clients  principally governmental entities  with financial performance guarantees  which are generally backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds 
in general  we would be liable for the amounts of these guarantees in the event our nonperformance permits termination of the related contract by our client  the likelihood of which we believe is remote 
we believe we are in compliance with our performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee 
the following table summarizes the estimated expiration of financial guarantees outstanding as of december  in millions total estimated expiration per period thereafter performance guarantees csft transactions standby letters of credit  surety bonds and other other guarantees total contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes payments due in specified periods related to our contractual obligations as of december  in millions total payments due by period less than year years years more than years long term debt  including current portion and interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations total amounts represent the expected cash payments principal and interest of our long term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments or bond premiums or discounts 
amounts also include capital lease payments principal and interest 
purchase obligations include material agreements to purchase goods or services  principally software and telecommunications services  that are enforceable and legally binding on eds and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
purchase obligations also exclude our obligation to repurchase minority interests in joint ventures 
minimum pension funding requirements are not included as such amounts are zero for our us pension plans and have not been determined for foreign pension plans 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december   and in millions cash flows net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities free cash flow operating activities 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was due to a million decrease in earnings  adjusted to exclude non cash operating items  offset by a million change in operating assets and liabilities 
the change in operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from a decrease in vendor prepayments  a decrease in construction costs related to our active construct contracts and a reduction in tax payments  offset by restructuring payments  a decrease in accounts receivable collections and a one time pension payment of million associated with the termination of the inland revenue contract 
operating cash flows in were comprised of  million in cash provided by our core it outsourcing and consulting businesses excluding nmci  offset by million in cash used by our nmci contract 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was due to a million decrease in earnings  as adjusted to exclude non cash operating items  and a million change in operating assets and liabilities 
the change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily the result of lower net customer prepayments in as compared to operating cash flows in were comprised of  million in cash provided by our core it outsourcing business excluding nmci and our at kearney and ugs plm solutions subsidiaries  offset by million in cash used by our nmci contract 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in includes the proceeds from the divestitures of our us wireless clearing business  ugs plm solutions and arg 
divestiture proceeds were somewhat offset by net purchases of marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities in also includes a million cash payment related to the purchase of financial assets associated with the nmci securitization facility 
excluding this purchase  net proceeds from investments and other assets decreased in compared to due primarily to lower securitization proceeds and equipment purchases associated with the nmci contract 
the decrease in net cash used in investment activities in compared to was partially due to a reduction in purchases of property and equipment due to an increase in the use of leased equipment  the utilization of the nmci securitization facility and reduced contract signings relative to prior years 
in addition  net proceeds related to investments in marketable securities increased in due to the sale of securities which had been held as a requirement of our state of texas medicaid contract which terminated in the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in was somewhat offset by an increase in payments for the purchase of software due primarily to the prepayment of our remaining minimum commitment under a software subscription agreement of million during financing activities 
the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in net payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations  partially offset by proceeds from our common stock issuance associated with a debt exchange and by a reduction in dividend payments 
the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in compared to was primarily due to the million purchase of treasury shares in  offset by a decrease in net proceeds from long term debt and other borrowings in free cash flow 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities  less capital expenditures 
capital expenditures is the sum of i net cash used in investing activities  excluding proceeds from sales of marketable securities  proceeds from divested assets  payments related to acquisitions  net of cash acquired  and other equity investments  and payments for purchases of marketable securities  and ii capital lease payments 
during  we sold our ugs plm solutions subsidiary and repurchased financial assets outstanding under the nmci contract securitization facility 
due to the significance of these transactions  the calculation of free cash flow for was adjusted to exclude million in transaction fees paid during related to the ugs plm solutions disposition  and the million cash payment related to the repurchase of financial assets associated with the nmci securitization facility 
the calculation of free cash flow for was also adjusted to include million in cash generated through utilization of operating tax credits  predominantly related to  to offset income tax associated with the ugs plm solutions disposition such tax credits would otherwise have been available to offset future taxable income generated by operations 
free cash flow is a non gaap measure and should be viewed together with our consolidated statements of cash flows 
free cash flow for the year ended december  reflects net cash provided by operating activities of  million  less capital expenditures of  million 
free cash flow for the year ended december  reflects net cash provided by operating activities of  million less capital expenditures of  million 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  are comprised of gross capital requirements of  million offset by proceeds from csfts  securitization and leasing arrangements of million 
free cash flow usage of million for the nmci contract for the year ended december  reflects net cash used in operating activities of million less capital expenditures of million which includes the million payment related to the repurchase of financial assets associated with the nmci securitization facility 
gross capital requirements related to the nmci contract were million during the year ended december  offset by proceeds from the nmci securitization and leasing arrangements of million 
we refer you to the discussion of our repurchase of financial assets associated with the nmci securitization facility under off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations above 
credit facilities 
during  we entered into a million three and one half year multi currency revolving credit agreement with a bank group including citibank  na  as administrative agent  and bank of america  na  as syndication agent 
the new facility replaces our five year million revolving credit facility  which expired in september  the new facility may be used for general corporate borrowing purposes and the issuance of letters of credit 
the aggregate availability under the new facility  together with our million three year multi currency revolving credit agreement entered into in  is billion 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under either of these facilities and we had issued letters of credit totaling million under the million three and one half year multi currency revolving credit agreement  thereby reducing the availability under these facilities to million at such date 
the new facility includes financial and other covenants of the general nature contained in the facility it replaced and the million three and one half year multi currency revolving credit facility was amended and restated to include financial and other terms similar to the new facility 
in addition  we have in place a revolving secured financing arrangement collateralized by certain trade receivables 
maximum borrowings under this secured a r facility vary based on the amount of eligible trade receivables  however  outstanding borrowings under the facility cannot exceed million 
no amounts were outstanding under this facility at december  the facility will expire in december we have made no decision as to whether we will seek to replace this facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this report for a description of this facility 
our unsecured credit and secured a r facilities contain certain financial and other restrictive covenants and representations and warranties that would allow any amounts outstanding under the facilities to be accelerated  or restrict our ability to borrow thereunder  in the event of noncompliance 
the financial covenants of our unsecured credit facilities were modified in september in connection with the replacement of our million credit facility as discussed above  and include a minimum net worth covenant  a fixed charge coverage requirement and a leverage ratio requirement 
the leverage ratio cannot exceed to from july through june  to from july through december  and to thereafter 
the fixed charge coverage covenant requires us to maintain a fixed charge ratio of no less than to through june  to from july through december  and to thereafter 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  the following table presents the financial covenant requirements under our unsecured credit and secured a r facilities and the calculated amount or ratios at december  dollars in millions covenant actual minimum net worth leverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio credit ratings 
the following table summarizes our senior long term debt credit ratings by moody s investor services  inc moody s  standard poor s rating services s p and fitch ratings at december  moody s s p fitch senior long term debt ba bbb bbb outlook negative negative negative on july   moody s lowered our long term credit rating to ba  with a negative outlook  from baa also on that date  s p placed our senior unsecured debt rating of bbb on creditwatch with negative implications 
on december   s p removed us from creditwatch 
on november  fitch removed our bbb senior long term debt rating from rating watch negative 
fitch had placed that rating on rating watch negative earlier that month following our announcement that we had postponed the release of our third quarter earnings 
as a result of our moody s debt rating  the interest rate payable on billion of our senior unsecured debt was increased from to 
further downgrades in our credit rating will not affect this rate 
however  in the event our credit rating is subsequently increased to baa or above by moody s and our s p credit rating remains at or above bbb  this rate will return to 
these credit rating agencies could take further adverse actions with respect to our ratings 
further negative changes in our credit ratings could increase our cost of capital 
at december  we had no recognized or contingent material liabilities that would be subject to accelerated payment due to a ratings downgrade 
we do not believe a negative change in our credit rating would have a material adverse impact on us under the terms of our existing client agreements 
liquidity goals 
at december   we had total liquidity of approximately billion  comprised of unrestricted cash and marketable securities of approximately billion and availability under our unsecured credit and secured a r facilities of approximately billion 
management intends over the longer term to maintain liquidity in an amount equal to at least months of forecasted capital expenditures as defined under free cash flow above  interest payments  debt maturities and dividend payments 
our liquidity at december  was significantly greater than such minimum targeted levels 
change in dividend rate 
on july   our board of directors reduced the quarterly dividend on our common stock from to per share 
this reduction will make available an additional million on an annualized basis to invest in our business and enhance our competitiveness 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
areas in which significant judgments and estimates are used include  but are not limited to  revenue recognition  accounts receivable collectibility  accounting for long lived assets  deferred income taxes  retirement plans  performance guarantees and litigation 
revenue recognition and associated cost deferral 
we provide it and business process outsourcing services under time and material  unit price and fixed price contracts  which may extend up to or more years 
services provided over the term of these arrangements may include one or more of the following it infrastructure support and management  it system and software maintenance  application hosting  the design  development  or construction of software and systems construct service  transaction processing  and business process management 
if a contract involves the provision of a single element  revenue is generally recognized when the product or service is provided and the amount becomes billable currently or upon any contract termination event 
if the service is provided evenly during the contract term but service billings are irregular  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
however  if the single service is a construct service  revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method using a zero profit methodology 
under this method  costs are deferred until contractual milestones are met  at which time the milestone billing is recognized as revenue and an amount of deferred costs is recognized as expense so that cumulative profit equals zero 
if the milestone billing exceeds deferred costs  then the excess is recorded as deferred revenue 
when the construct service is completed and the final milestone met  all unrecognized costs  milestone billings  and profit are recognized in full 
if the contract does not contain contractual milestones  costs are expensed as incurred and revenue is recognized in an amount equal to costs incurred until completion of the construct service  at which time any profit would be recognized in full 
if total costs are estimated to exceed revenue for the construct service  then a provision for the estimated loss is made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
if a contract involves the provision of multiple service elements  total estimated contract revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element 
the amount of revenue allocated to each element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another element in the future 
revenue is then recognized for each element as described above for single element contracts  except revenue recognized on a straight line basis for a non construct service will not exceed amounts currently billable unless the excess revenue is recoverable from the client upon any contract termination event 
if the amount of revenue allocated to a construct service is less than its relative fair value  costs to deliver such service equal to the difference between allocated revenue and the relative fair value are deferred and amortized over the contract term 
if total construct service costs are estimated to exceed the relative fair value for the construct service contained in a multiple element arrangement  then a provision for the estimated loss is made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
we also defer and subsequently amortize certain set up costs related to activities that enable the provision of contracted services to the client 
such activities include the relocation of transitioned employees  the migration of client systems or processes  and the exit of client facilities 
deferred contract costs  including set up costs  are amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining original contract term unless billing patterns indicate a more accelerated method is appropriate 
the recoverability of deferred contract costs associated with a particular contract is analyzed whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable using the undiscounted estimated cash flows of the whole contract over its remaining contract term 
if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the long lived assets and deferred contract costs  including contract concessions paid to the client  the deferred contract costs and contract concessions are written down by the amount of the cash flow deficiency 
if a cash flow deficiency remains after reducing the balance of the deferred contract costs and contract concessions to zero  any remaining long lived assets are evaluated for impairment 
any such impairment recognized would equal the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of those assets 
other than one construct service element with the uk government for which deferred costs totaled million  no single contract had deferred contract costs that exceeded million at december  accounts receivable 
reserves for uncollectible trade receivables are established when collection of amounts due from clients is deemed improbable 
indicators of improbable collection include client bankruptcy  client litigation  industry downturns  client cash flow difficulties or ongoing service or billing disputes 
receivables more than days past due are automatically reserved unless persuasive evidence of probable collection exists 
our allowances for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total gross trade receivables  excluding unbilled receivables at december   were  and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in the allowance in resulted from the recognition of reserves in connection with the us airways bankruptcy 
excluding those reserves  the allowance percentage was at december  the increase in the allowance in resulted from the recognition of reserves in connection with the worldcom and us airways bankruptcies 
excluding these reserves  the allowance percentage was at december  long lived assets 
our property and equipment  software and definite lived intangible asset policies require the amortization or depreciation of assets over their estimated useful lives 
an asset s useful life is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows 
the useful lives of property and equipment are limited to the standard depreciable lives or  for certain assets dedicated to client contracts  the related contract term 
the useful lives of capitalized software are limited to the shorter of the license period or the related contract term 
the estimated useful lives of definite lived intangible assets are based on the expected use of the asset and factors that may limit the use of the asset 
we may utilize the assistance of a third party appraiser in the assessment of the useful life of an intangible asset 
tradename intangibles and goodwill are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
the carrying amounts of tradename intangibles are compared to their fair values as determined using a relief from royalty approach which estimates the current value of royalties that would have to be paid if the company did not own the tradename intangibles 
any excess amounts of carrying value over the fair value of tradename intangibles are written off 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is the amount at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
we conducted an annual goodwill impairment test as of december  the goodwill impairment test requires us to identify our reporting units and obtain estimates of the fair values of those units as of the testing date 
our reporting units are comprised of the geographic components of our operating segments that share similar economic characteristics 
we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models 
those models require estimates of future revenues  profits  capital expenditures and working capital for each unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
we utilize our weighted average cost of capital to discount the estimated expected future cash flows of each unit 
the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value in indicating the underlying goodwill of each unit was not impaired 
we plan to conduct our annual impairment test as of december st of each year when our budgets and operating plans for the forthcoming year are expected to be finalized 
the timing and frequency of additional goodwill impairment tests are based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would more than likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we will continue to monitor our goodwill balance for impairment and conduct formal tests when impairment indicators are present 
a decline in the fair value of any of our reporting units below its carrying value is an indicator that the underlying goodwill of the unit is potentially impaired 
this situation would require the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine whether the unit s goodwill is impaired 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
an impairment loss is required for the amount which the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill would become the new cost basis of the unit s goodwill 
deferred income taxes 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statements purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly 
factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset  planned use of the tax asset  and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located 
valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors 
a majority of the tax assets are associated with tax jurisdictions in which we have a large scale of operations and long history of generating taxable income  thereby reducing the estimation risk associated with recoverability analysis 
however  in smaller tax jurisdictions in which we have less historical experience or smaller scale of operations  the assessment of recoverability of tax assets is largely based on projections of taxable income over the expiration period of the tax asset and is subject to greater estimation risk 
accordingly  it is reasonably possible the recoverability of tax assets in these smaller jurisdictions could be impaired as a result of poor operating performance over extended periods of time or a future decision to reduce or eliminate operating activity in such jurisdictions 
such an impairment would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and related tax expense in the period of impairment 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine the payment for these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
retirement plans 
we offer pension and other postretirement benefits to our employees through multiple global pension plans 
our largest pension plans are funded through our cash contributions and earnings on plan assets 
we use the actuarial models required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  to account for our pension plans 
two of the most significant actuarial assumptions used to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined pension benefit plans are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate assumptions 
sfas no 
requires the use of an expected long term rate of return that  over time  will approximate the actual long term returns earned on pension plan assets 
we base this assumption on historical five year actual returns as well as anticipated future returns based on our investment mix 
given our relatively young workforce  we are able to take a long term view of our pension investment strategy 
accordingly  plan assets are weighted heavily towards equity investments 
equity investments are susceptible to significant short term fluctuations but have historically outperformed most other investment alternatives on a long term basis 
at december   of pension assets were invested in public and private equity and real estate investments with the remaining assets being invested in fixed income securities 
such mix is consistent with that assumed in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
rebalancing our actual asset allocations to our planned allocations based on actual performance has not been a significant issue 
an weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption was used for the pension plan actuarial valuations compared to a rate used in a basis point increase or decrease in this assumption results in an estimated pension expense decrease or increase  respectively  of million in the subsequent year s pension expense based on the most recent pension valuation and assuming all other variables are constant 
an assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial valuation 
this rate reflects the underlying rate determined on the measurement date at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled 
high quality bond yields on our measurement date  october   with maturities consistent with expected pension payment periods are used to determine the appropriate discount rate assumption 
such weighted average maturities are currently estimated to be years 
a weighted average discount rate assumption was used for the pension plan actuarial valuations 
the methodology used to determine the appropriate discount rate assumption has been consistently applied 
a basis point increase in the discount rate assumption will result in an estimated decrease of approximately million in the subsequent year s pension expense  and a basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption will result in an estimated increase of approximately million in the subsequent year s pension expense based on the most recent pension valuation and assuming all other variables are constant 
negative financial market returns in caused our actual pension plan asset returns in that year to be less than the expected returns reflected in our assumptions 
our long standing policy of making consistent cash pension plan contributions provided some protection against negative short term market returns 
in addition  positive financial market returns in and resulted in our actual pension plan asset returns exceeding expected returns reflected in our assumptions 
however  despite contributions and positive returns in and  declining discount rates over the last several years have caused a significant decline in our pension plans funded status  which as of october   reflected total plan assets of billion and total accumulated benefit obligations under all plans of billion 
as a result  under the requirements of sfas no 
 we have an additional minimum pension plan liability of million at december  with a corresponding reduction  net of tax  in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders equity 
our weighted average long term rate of return assumption for plan assets as of january  is 
our net periodic pension cost is expected to decrease from exclusive of the expected million settlement loss related to the inland revenue contract 
our required minimum amount of contributions will not exceed actual contributions made in however  we may elect to increase the level of contributions in over levels based on a number of factors  including performance of pension investments  changes in interest rates and changes in workforce compensation 
other liabilities 
in the normal course of business  we may provide certain clients  principally governmental entities  with financial performance guarantees  which are generally backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds 
in general  we would only be liable for the amounts of these guarantees in the event that our nonperformance permits termination of the related contract by our client  the likelihood of which we believe is remote 
at december   we had million of outstanding standby letters of credit and surety bonds relating to these performance guarantees 
in addition  we had million outstanding under csft and securitization transactions that are supported by performance guarantees 
we believe we are in compliance with our performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee 
in addition  we had million of other financial guarantees outstanding at december  relating to indebtedness of others 
there are various claims and pending actions against eds arising in the ordinary course of our business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of current litigation 
certain of these actions seek damages in significant amounts 
among other things  we consider the period in which the underlying cause of the claim occurred  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the loss to determine whether a loss accrual or disclosure in our consolidated financial statements is required 
the degree of probability and the loss related to a particular claim are typically estimated with the assistance of legal counsel 
new accounting standards during december  the fasb issued revised sfas  share based payment 
this statement requires accounting for the issuance of share based payments as compensation expense  where the original sfas allowed accounting for such payments under apb if a company elected to account for share based payments under apb  the notes to the financial statements required pro forma disclosure of compensation expense as if sfas were used 
the new statement is required to be adopted for interim fiscal periods beginning after june  while we are allowed to adopt this standard effective july   we intend to adopt the standard as of january  effective for and subsequent years  we expect to redesign our long term incentive compensation program to include the use of performance rsus and significantly reduce the number of stock options granted 
see overview priorities and expectations for and beyond above 
compensation expense will be recorded for these performance rsus based on the market value of our stock on the date of grant  and will be charged to operations over the vesting period 
if vesting of performance rsus is conditioned upon the achievement of performance goals  compensation expense during the performance period will be estimated using the most probable outcome of the performance goals  and adjusted as the expected outcome changes 
we have unvested employee stock options outstanding as of december   most of which will vest in the next three years  during which time compensation expense will continue to be recorded as the options vest 
some of these options have exercise prices that are in excess of the current market value of our stock  and it is possible that these options will expire without being exercised 
the pro forma earnings in the table below provide the approximate effect on earnings during the periods covered by this form k had we adopted the statement as of january  in millions  except per share amounts stock based employee compensation cost included in reported net income loss  net of related tax effects incremental stock based compensation expense had the company adopted the new statement on january  total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards  net of related tax effects compensation expense per share of common stock if statement had been adopted january  basic diluted we expect to record compensation expense in of approximately million net of tax  or per share  for stock options granted prior to december  in addition  due to anticipated changes to our long term incentive compensation strategy  we expect to grant restricted share units in and record compensation expense for these units of approximately million net of tax  or per share 
we expect to record another million net of tax  or per share  in due to vesting of restricted share units granted prior to december  we recognized million of compensation expense  net of tax  in related to these units 
the combined expense will result in total share based compensation of approximately million net of tax  or per share 
however  certain awards granted prior to december   have features that accelerate vesting if our stock price reaches stated levels 
if our stock price closes at approximately per share for ten consecutive trading days  we expect to record incremental compensation expense of approximately million  net of tax 
our pro forma compensation expense in the table above is based on an effective tax benefit of which will be achieved by recording a deferred tax asset when compensation expense is recorded 
the excess of the market value of our stock over the exercise price at the date of exercise represents the tax deduction to be received 
if this deduction is equal to the amount of compensation expense recorded for that option  the entire tax asset is realized 
if the deduction is greater than the compensation expense recognized  we will record an increase in additional paid in capital 
however  if the deduction is less than the expense recognized  a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  and the deficiency will be reported as deferred tax expense in the period that options expire or are exercised or forfeited 
there are numerous factors that influence the amount of the deferred tax asset that will be realized  including exercise behavior of the employees  future market price of the stock  as well as the stabilization of the volatility used in calculating the fair value of options on the grant date 
at this time  we cannot predict the expected realization of the deferred tax asset  therefore the tax benefit could be up to 
factors that may affect future results because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
our engagements with clients may not be profitable 
the pricing and other terms of our client contracts  particularly our long term it outsourcing agreements  require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results 
these estimates reflect our best judgments regarding the nature of the engagement and our expected costs to provide the contracted services 
any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements  including delays caused by factors outside our control  could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable  which would have an adverse effect on our profit margin 
in addition  a majority of our it outsourcing contracts contain some fixed price  incentive based or other pricing terms that condition our fee on our ability to meet defined goals 
our failure to meet a client s expectations in any type of contract may result in an unprofitable engagement 
our ability to recover significant capital investments in certain construct contracts is subject to risks 
some of our client contracts require significant investment in the early stages which is recovered through billings over the life of the respective contract 
these contracts often involve the construction of new computer systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies 
substantial performance risk exists in each contract with these characteristics  and some or all elements of service delivery under these contracts are dependent upon successful completion of the development  construction and deployment phases 
contracts with ongoing construct activities had assets  including receivables  prepaid expenses  deferred costs  equipment and software  of approximately billion at december   including approximately billion associated with the nmci contract and million associated with one development contract with the uk government 
some of these contracts  including the nmci and uk government contracts  have experienced delays in their development and construction phases  and certain milestones have been missed 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to write down nmci contract related fixed asset and prepaid software license balances to estimated fair value 
we refer you to the discussion of the nmci contract under overview highlights above for further information regarding this impairment charge and our risks under that contract 
remaining long lived assets and lease receivables associated with the contract totaled million and million  respectively  at december  impact of rating agency downgrades 
on july   moody s lowered our long term credit rating to ba  with a negative outlook  from baa also on that date  s p placed our senior unsecured debt rating of bbb on creditwatch with negative implications 
on december   s p removed us from creditwatch 
on november  fitch removed our bbb senior long term debt rating from rating watch negative 
fitch had placed that rating on rating watch negative earlier that month following our announcement that we had postponed the release of our third quarter earnings 
any adverse action by these agencies with respect to our ratings could have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 
moody s downgrade of our long term credit rating to below investment grade or any further negative change in our credit ratings could materially adversely impact our ability to compete for new business  our cost of capital and our ability to access capital 
a decline in revenues from or loss of significant clients could reduce our revenues and profitability 
our success is to a significant degree dependent on our ability to retain our significant clients and maintain or increase the level of revenues from these clients 
we may lose clients due to their merger or acquisition  business failure  contract expiration  conversion to a competing service provider or conversion to an in house data processing system 
we may not be able to retain or renew relationships with our significant clients in the future 
as a result of business downturns or for other business reasons  we are also vulnerable to reduced processing volumes from our clients  which can reduce the scope of services provided and the prices for those services 
our outsourcing segment generates a substantial majority of its revenues from long term it outsourcing agreements  including a number of mega deals 
a number of these outsourcing agreements have terms that expire in coming years  including our msa with gm which expires in our revenues from gm were approximately billion  billion and billion for  and  respectively 
operating margins from our gm business are expected to decline slightly from current levels based on lower pricing under the msa as well as gm s move towards a multi vendor strategy 
furthermore  the loss of gm as an ongoing major customer would have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings 
the extent of such impact on our earnings will be based in part on our ability to reduce the fixed costs associated with this agreement  including property  equipment and software 
in addition  the extension of this agreement  in whole or in part  on terms less favorable to us than current terms would also adversely affect our revenue and earnings 
an ongoing sec investigation could adversely affect us or the market value of our securities 
the sec staff is conducting a formal investigation of some of our activities and contracts 
we refer you to legal proceedings under item of this form k above for a description of this investigation 
the investigation is ongoing  and we will continue to cooperate with the sec staff 
we are unable to predict the outcome of the investigation  the scope of matters that the sec may choose to investigate in the course of this investigation or in the future  the sec s views of the issues being investigated  or any action that the sec might take  including the imposition of fines  penalties  or other available remedies 
any adverse development in connection with the investigation  including any expansion of the scope of the investigation  could have a material adverse effect on us  including diverting the efforts and attention of our management team from our business operations  and could negatively impact the market value of our securities 
pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
we and certain of our current and former directors and officers are defendants in numerous shareholder class action suits 
we refer you to legal proceedings under item of this form k above for a description of these actions 
we are not able to determine the actual impact of these suits on us or our consolidated financial statements 
however  we may be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses in aggregate amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
a material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us 
a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on us 
in connection with the review by our independent auditors of our third quarter results and the on going procedures related to their audit of internal controls over financial reporting as of december   our independent auditors identified material weaknesses in our internal controls related to the nmci contract and revenue recognition 
we refer you to item a 
controls and procedures below 
other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could occur or be identified in the future 
in addition  because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements  and any projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  including any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or if we experience difficulties in their implementation  our business and results of operations could be harmed  we could fail to be able to provide reasonable assurance as to our financial results or meet our reporting obligations  and there could be a material adverse effect on the price of our securities 
some of our contracts contain benchmarking provisions that could decrease our revenues and profitability 
some of our long term it outsourcing agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a client to request a benchmark study by a mutually acceptable third party benchmarker 
typically  benchmarking may not be conducted during the initial years of the contract term but may be requested by a client periodically thereafter  subject to restrictions which limit benchmarking to certain groupings of services and limit the number of times benchmarking may be elected during the term of the contract 
generally  the benchmarking compares the contractual price of our services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a peer comparison group  subject to agreed upon adjustment and normalization factors 
generally  if the benchmarking study shows that our pricing has a difference outside a specified range  and the difference is not due to the unique requirements of the client  then the parties will negotiate in good faith any appropriate adjustments to the pricing 
this may result in the reduction of our rates for the benchmarked services 
due to the enhanced focus of our clients on reducing it costs  as well as the uncertainties and complexities inherent in benchmarking comparisons  our clients may increasingly attempt to obtain additional price reductions beyond those already embedded in our contract rates through the exercise of benchmarking provisions 
such activities could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flow in or thereafter to a greater extent than has been our prior experience 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the markets in which we operate include a large number of participants and are highly competitive 
our primary competitors are it service providers  large accounting  consulting and other professional service firms  application service providers  packaged software vendors and resellers and service groups of computer equipment companies 
we also experience competition from numerous smaller  niche oriented and regionalized service providers 
our business is experiencing rapid changes in its competitive landscape 
we increasingly see our competitors moving operations offshore to reduce their costs as well as direct competition from niche offshore providers  primarily india based competitors 
with lower costs  these competitors may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer  which would adversely affect our ability to compete 
in addition  negative publicity from our pending litigation  credit ratings downgrade or sec staff investigation could have a negative effect on our competitive position 
any of these factors may impose additional pricing pressure on us  which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and profit margin 
our exposure to certain industries and financially troubled customers has adversely affected our financial results 
our exposure to certain industries and financially troubled customers has had  and could in the future have  a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations 
for example  we are the leading it outsourcing provider to the airline industry  which sector has been experiencing significant financial difficulty 
in  we amended agreements with certain of those clients  which has resulted in a decrease in revenues and earnings from these clients 
our largest it agreement in the airline industry is with american airlines 
we had million in receivables and million in other operating assets associated with that contract at december  we also provide it services to us airways through a long term agreement 
in september  us airways filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
due to uncertainties regarding recoverability of pre bankruptcy receivables associated with the us airways agreement  we recorded net charges totaling million during the third quarter of at december   we had other assets with a net book value of approximately million deployed on that agreement 
we may have outstanding receivables under this agreement at any one time of up to approximately million 
if us airways is not successful in emerging from bankruptcy proceedings and ceases operations  all or a significant portion of these assets and any post bankruptcy receivables will become impaired 
in addition  our exposure to investments in aircraft leases  which include leases with american  delta and continental airlines  was million at december  we may not achieve the benefits we expect from our multi year plan 
management is implementing a multi year plan designed to make significant changes in the way we do business 
this plan includes the development of a new technology platform for the delivery of our services which we refer to as the eds agile enterprise as well as other initiatives intended to substantially reduce our cost structure 
we expect to invest significant capital in the implementation of the multi year plan in although management believes this plan will enable us to achieve sustainable  profitable growth over the longer term  there can be no assurance as to the acceptance of our technology initiatives in the marketplace or our ability to recognize a return on our investment 
in addition  our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives is subject to many estimates and assumptions  including assumptions regarding the costs and timing of activities in connection with these initiatives 
in addition  these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic  competitive and other uncertainties that are beyond our control 
if these assumptions are not realized  or if other unforeseen events occur  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected and there could be a material adverse effect on the price of our securities 
a significant or prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our results of operations are affected by the level of business activity of our clients  which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve 
the general economic weakness in the it industry resulting from  among other things  the decline in discretionary it spending by our clients and prospective clients  has adversely affected our revenues in recent years 
a lack of improvement or continued decline in the level of business activity of our clients could continue to adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
we cannot be sure that our services and products  or the products of others that we offer to our clients  do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties  and we may have infringement claims asserted against us 
these claims may harm our reputation  cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or products 
we generally agree in our contracts to indemnify our clients for any expenses or liabilities they may incur resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties 
in some instances  the amount of these indemnities may be greater than the revenues we receive from the client 
any claims or litigation in this area  whether we ultimately win or lose  could be time consuming and costly  injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
we may  in limited cases  be required to forego rights to the use of intellectual property we help create  which limits our ability to also provide that intellectual property to other clients 
any limitation on our ability to provide a service or product could cause us to lose revenue generating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements the statements in this report that are not historical statements are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements include statements regarding estimated revenues  earnings  cash flows  the tcv of new business signings  estimated cost savings and other forward looking financial information 
in addition  we have made in the past and may make in the future other written or oral forward looking statements  including statements regarding future financial and operating performance  short and long term revenue  earnings and cash flow  the timing of the revenue  earnings and cash flow impact of new and existing contracts  liquidity  estimated future revenues from existing clients  the value of new contract signings  business pipeline  industry growth rates and our performance relative thereto  the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  and the impact of client bankruptcies 
any forward looking statement may rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and be subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors  many of which are outside our control  that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements 
in addition to the factors outlined under factors that may affect future results above  these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the performance of current and future client contracts in accordance with our cost  revenue and cash flow estimates  including our ability to achieve any operational efficiencies in our estimates  for contracts with us federal government clients  including our nmci contract  the government s ability to cancel the contract or impose additional terms and conditions due to changes in government funding or deployment schedules  military action or otherwise  our ability to access the capital markets  including our ability to obtain capital leases  surety bonds and letters of credit  to arrange new client supported financing transactions or similar facilities and continue to access existing facilities  the impact on a historical and prospective basis of accounting rules and pronouncements  the impact of claims  litigation and governmental investigations  the success of our strategic reorganization and cost cutting initiatives and the timing and amount of any resulting benefits  the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  a reduction in the carrying value of our assets  the impact of a bankruptcy or financial difficulty of a significant client on the financial and other terms of our agreements with that client  with respect to the funding of our pension plan obligations  the performance of our investments relative to our assumed rate of return  changes in tax laws and interpretations and failure to obtain treaty relief from double taxation  competition in the industries in which we conduct business and the impact of competition on pricing  revenues and margins  the impact of general economic and other conditions on the discretionary spend of our existing clients and our ability to obtain new business  the degree to which third parties continue to outsource it and business processes  and fluctuations in foreign currencies  exchange rates and interest rates 
we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except as may be required by law 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into various hedging transactions to manage this risk 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments  are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is managed through our debt portfolio of fixed and variable rate instruments including interest rate swaps 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in short term market interest rates 
if these rates average more in than in  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  had short term market interest rates averaged more than in  there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
equity price sensitivity 
our financial position is affected by changes in equity prices as a result of certain investments 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in the value of our equity security investments 
if the market price of our investments in equity securities in were to fall by below the level at the end of  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  declines in the market price of our equity securities did not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
foreign exchange risk 
we conduct business in the united states and around the world 
our most significant foreign currency transaction exposures relate to canada  the united kingdom  western european countries that use the euro as a common currency  australia and new zealand 
the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against foreign currency exchange risk from intercompany financing and trading transactions 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and currency options with durations of generally less than days to hedge such transactions 
we have not entered into foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
generally  foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign denominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in foreign currency rates against the us dollar 
if these rates average more in than in  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  had foreign currency rates averaged more than in  there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position
