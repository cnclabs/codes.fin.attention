overview competitive  economic and industry factors we are an energy company 
we mine coal  which is used to produce electric power  and we own interests in power generating plants 
we began to earn royalties from the production of coalbed methane gas in the first quarter of all of our five mines supply baseloaded power plants 
several of these power plants are located adjacent to our mines and we sell virtually all our coal under long term contracts 
consequently  our mines enjoy relatively stable demand and pricing compared to competitors who sell more of their production on the spot market 
in partnership with others  we have developed eight independent power projects totaling megawatts  or mw  of generating capacity 
we have sold our interests in five of those projects 
we currently own a interest in the rova i and ii coal fired plants  which have a total generating capacity of mw 
we also retain a interest in the gas fired fort lupton project  which has a generating capacity of mw and provides peaking power to the local utility 
the rova project  which accounted for of our equity in earnings from independent power in  is baseloaded and supplies power pursuant to a long term contract 
according to the annual energy outlook prepared by the energy information administration  or eia  an agency of the us department of energy  approximately of all electricity generated in the united states in was produced by coal fired units 
the eia projects that the demand for coal used to generate electricity will increase per year from through consequently  we believe that the demand for coal will grow  in part because coal is the lowest cost fossil fuel used for generating baseload electric power 
revenues and expenses  sources and uses of cash in  approximately three fourths of our operating income came from coal operations  and one fourth came from independent power projects 
our principal expenses were the cost of coal sales  heritage health benefit costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
in  in order to finance the purchase of the rosebud  jewett  beulah  and savage mines  westmoreland mining borrowed million from institutional lenders under a term loan agreement 
by the end of  westmoreland mining had repaid million of that million and deposited an additional million into two restricted accounts for the benefit of its lenders 
in early march  westmoreland mining made arrangements to borrow an additional million from the lenders pursuant to what we call the add on facility 
westmoreland mining borrowed million immediately and the additional million in december the add on facility permits westmoreland mining to undertake certain significant capital projects in the near term without adversely affecting cash available to us 
we may also seek additional capital in for general corporate purposes and to support our growth and development strategy 
meeting our commitment to preferred stockholders we remain committed to meeting our obligation for accumulated dividends to our preferred stockholders 
as of january   million had accumulated 
a quarterly dividend of per depositary share will be paid on april   to stockholders of record on march  the accumulated amount will continue to increase until we pay quarterly dividends of per depositary share 
challenges we believe that our principal challenges today include the following inflation in medical costs and longer life expectancies  which can increase our expense for active employees and heritage health benefit costs  maintaining and collateralizing our coal act and reclamation bonds  transitioning from an approach towards growth and development that seeks to maximize the use of our net operating loss carryforwards to one that considers the impact of the alternative minimum tax  managing the production and costs of our operations  proposed new environmental regulations  which have the potential to significantly reduce sales primarily from our absaloka  jewett and beulah mines  and addressing the claims for potential taxes asserted by various governmental entities 
we discuss these issues  as well as the other challenges we face  elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and under risk factors 
critical accounting estimates and related matters our discussion and analysis of financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we have made significant judgments and estimates in connection with the following accounting matters 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of the accounting estimates in the section below with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in connection with our discussion of these critical accounting matters  and in order to reduce repetition  we also use this section to present information related to these judgments and estimates 
postretirement benefits and pension obligations our most significant long term obligation is the obligation to provide postretirement medical benefits  pension benefits  workers compensation and pneumoconiosis black lung benefits 
we provide these benefits to our current and former employees and their dependents 
estimates and judgments we estimate the total amount of these obligations with the help of third party professionals using actuarial assumptions and information 
our estimate is sensitive to judgments we make about the discount rate  about the rate of inflation in medical care  about mortality rates  and about the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of or medicare reform act 
we review these estimates and obligations at least annually 
we pay these obligations currently and will have continuing obligations for future periods 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to estimate the present value of these obligations 
in order to do this  we make a judgment about the discount rate  which is an estimate about the current interest rate at which these obligations could be effectively settled on the date we estimate them 
the discount rate used to calculate the present value of postretirement medical obligations was in  in and in the discount rate used to calculate the present value of pension obligations was in  in and in significant changes to interest rates result in substantial volatility to our financial statements by influencing our estimate of these amounts 
the recent trend of decreasing discount rates has significantly increased the present value of our obligations and our reported costs 
an additional change in the discount rate would change the net benefit obligation for post retirement medical and pension benefits by approximately million and million  respectively 
in order to estimate the total cost of our obligation to provide medical benefits  we must make a judgment about the rate of inflation in medical costs 
as our estimate of the rate of inflation of medical costs increases  our calculation of the total cost of providing these benefits increases 
during  we increased our assumption about this rate to  and we also assumed that the rate would ultimately decline to in and beyond 
if we were to increase our assumption of the ultimate medical inflation rate from to  then all other things being equal  the present value of our postretirement medical cost obligation would increase by approximately million 
our accruals for postretirement medical  pension  workers compensation and black lung benefits are also affected by the mortality rate of the population for which we provide benefits 
as people live longer  the cost of providing these benefits increases 
however  the number of assigned beneficiaries for our company under the coal act is fixed  since we discontinued our eastern underground operations  and the primary beneficiaries are elderly 
related information the present value of our actuarially determined liability for postretirement medical costs increased approximately million between december  and  principally because of the decrease in discount rate and the increase in our assumption about medical cost inflation as described above 
actuarial valuations project that our retiree health benefit costs for our current employees and retirees will continue at a high level in the near term and then decline to zero over the next approximately sixty years as the number of eligible beneficiaries declines 
we incurred cash costs of million for postretirement medical costs during including the combined fund s retroactive assessment balance of million  which was paid pending the outcome of that litigation compared to million in we expect to incur approximately million for these costs in we incurred cash costs of million for workers compensation benefits during compared to million in we expect to incur lower cash costs for workers compensation benefits in and expect that amount to decline nearly to zero over the next approximately years 
we anticipate that these costs will decline because we are no longer self insured for workers compensation benefits and have had no new claimants since however  the actuarially determined expense increased million in because of increased total remaining claims projections 
we do not pay pension or black lung benefits directly 
these benefits are paid from trusts that we established and funded 
as of december   our pension trusts are underfunded  and we expect to contribute approximately million to these trusts in as of december   our black lung trust is overfunded by million  and we do not expect to be required to make additional contributions to this trust 
the coal act  passed in  established three benefit plans 
first  the statute merged the umwa and plans into the combined fund 
the combined fund provides benefits to a completely closed pool of beneficiaries  retirees who were actually receiving benefits from either the or plan as of july  the coal act requires that the benefits provided to this group remain substantially the same as provided by the and plans as of january  this group is essentially medicare eligible and the combined fund supplements the benefits this group receives under medicare 
second  the coal act requires companies that had established individual employer plans  or ieps  pursuant to prior collective bargaining agreements to maintain those ieps and provide the beneficiaries a level of benefits substantially the same as they received as of january  the beneficiaries of these statutorily required ieps are retirees meeting age and service requirements as of february  and who actually retired before september  third  the coal act established the umwa benefit plan which serves three distinct populations miners who were eligible to retire as of february  and actually retired before september  and whose employers are no longer in business  miners receiving benefits under an iep but whose former employer went out of business  and new spouses or new dependants of retirees in the combined fund 
as required by the coal act  we maintain an iep for our own retirees  and we pay premiums that cover a portion of the retired miners whose previous employers have gone out of business 
in addition  and separate from the coal act  we continue to provide benefits under another iep to a smaller group of former umwa employees who retired under our last collective bargaining agreement  which ended in we expect that the medicare reform act will reduce our prescription drug costs 
the medicare reform act provides a prescription drug benefit under medicare as well as a federal subsidy  starting in so long as an employer maintains qualifying health plans that provide prescription drug benefits 
we currently estimate that the medicare reform act will reduce our retiree medical claims costs by approximately million in and annually thereafter until total drug costs begin to decline 
asset retirement obligations  reclamation costs and reserve estimates asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and the reclamation of land upon cessation of mining 
we account for reclamation costs  along with other costs related to mine closure  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
asset retirement obligations or sfas no 
 which we adopted on january  this statement requires us to recognize the fair value of an asset retirement obligation in the period in which we incur that obligation 
we capitalize the present value of our estimated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of our long lived assets 
the liability asset retirement obligations on our consolidated balance sheet represents our estimate of the present value of the cost of closing our mines and reclaiming land that has been disturbed by mining 
this liability increases as land is mined and decreases as reclamation work is performed and cash expended 
the asset  property  plant and equipment capitalized asset retirement costs  remains constant until new liabilities are incurred or old liabilities are re estimated 
we estimate the future costs of reclamation using standards for mine reclamation that have been established by the government agencies that regulate our operations as well as our own experience in performing reclamation activities 
these estimates may change 
developments in our mining program also affect this estimate by influencing the timing of reclamation expenditures 
adopting sfas no 
significantly affected our financial statements 
see the summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements  which includes a discussion of the effect on our financial statements of adopting sfas no 
however  the adoption of sfas no 
did not affect our cash costs  because the annual cash requirements for reclamation activities are the same using sfas no 
and the units of production accrual method  the accounting method we used prior to adopting sfas no 
we amortize our acquisition costs  development costs  capitalized asset retirement costs and some plant and equipment using the units of production method and estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves 
we review these estimates on a regular basis and adjust them to reflect our current mining plans 
the rate at which we record depletion also depends on the estimates of our reserves 
if the estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves decline  the rate at which we record depletion increases 
such a decline in reserves may result from geological conditions  coal quality  effects of governmental  environmental and tax regulations  and assumptions about future prices and future operating costs 
deferred income taxes estimates and judgments our net income is sensitive to estimates we make about our ability to use our federal net operating loss carryforwards  or nols 
as of december   we had approximately million of nols 
these nols expire at various dates through when we have taxable income  we can use our nols to shield that income from regular us federal income tax 
our ability to use our nols thus depends on all the factors that determine taxable income  including operational factors  such as new coal sales  and non operational factors  such as increases in heritage health benefit costs 
under federal tax law  our ability to use our nols would be limited if we had a change of ownership within the meaning of the federal tax code 
our nols are one of our deferred income tax assets 
we have reduced our deferred income tax assets by a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is primarily an estimate of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized in future periods 
on a quarterly and annual basis  we estimate how much of our nols we will be able to use to shield future taxable income and make corresponding adjustments in the valuation allowance 
if we increase our estimated utilization of nols  we decrease the valuation allowance  increase our net deferred income tax assets and recognize an income tax benefit in earnings 
if we decrease our estimated utilization of nols  we increase the valuation allowance  decrease our net deferred income tax assets and increase income tax expense 
these changes can materially affect our net income and our assets 
in  for example  we reduced the valuation allowance by million  in part because we improved the terms of an existing coal supply agreement 
we also made other adjustments in our net deferred tax assets 
as a result of these estimates and adjustments and changes in temporary differences between book and tax accounting  our net deferred income tax assets increased from million at december  to million at december   and we recognized income tax benefit from continuing operations of million for related information under the federal tax laws  there are two types of taxable income and two types of net operating loss carryforwards 
the two types of taxable income are regular taxable income and alternative minimum taxable income  or amti 
amti differs from regular taxable income in that amti includes items such as percentage depletion 
we have significant percentage depletion because of our mining activities 
the two types of nols are regular nols and alternative minimum tax  or amt  nols 
our nols are important to our strategy 
regular nols can offset our future regular taxable income  permit us to avoid payment of regular federal income tax  and thereby increase our cash flow and return from profitable investments as compared to the return that would be received by a tax paying entity that cannot shield its income from federal income taxation 
however  regular nols will not shield our income from amt 
we are subject to amt at a rate 
as of december   we had amt net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
only of our amti can be shielded each year by our amt nols 
based upon our estimates of our future taxable income  we expect to fully utilize our remaining amt nols in and begin paying the full amt in we may owe more than million per year in amt until we fully utilize our regular nols 
any amt we pay is available as a credit against future regular federal income tax 
these credits do not expire 
as a strategic matter  we may face choices between business strategies intended to maximize the use of our regular nols and strategies that take account of amt and seek to increase our after tax profits  including the effects of amt 
some of these strategies may involve decisions about business activities that generate amti  and many of these choices will require us to make judgments about matters that will arise in the future and that are therefore inherently uncertain 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table presents information about our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  some of the figures below are estimates 
we discuss these obligations and commitments elsewhere in this filing 
payments due by period in thousands of dollars contractual obligations and commitments total after westmoreland mining term debt      other debt   interest on debt       operating leases     heritage health benefit pension undiscounted obligations workers compensation     discounted obligations combined benefit fund multiemployer       postretirement medical       qualified pension benefits     serp benefits   pneumoconiosis       reclamation costs       preferred dividends       per year at december   westmoreland mining had deposited million in two restricted accounts as collateral against these obligations 
in calculating the amount of interest on debt  we have assumed that the interest rate on westmoreland mining s million of floating rate debt would not increase or decrease 
we have not accrued the present value of this obligation  because this plan is a multiemployer plan 
we expense our premium payments when due 
the table presents our estimate of our gross benefit obligation 
the accrued liability  net of the unrecognized net actuarial loss and the unrecognized net transition obligation  was million as of december the fair value of plan assets at december  was million 
the expected pension benefit payments shown above will be made from these assets 
the table presents our estimate of our gross benefit obligation 
the accrued liability  net of the unrecognized net actuarial gain and an unrecognized prior service cost  was million as of december  the plan was unfunded at december  the fair value of plan assets at december  was million 
pneumoconiosis benefits will be paid from these assets 
the table presents our estimate of our gross cost of final reclamation 
the accrued liability of million as of december  will increase in present value as acres are disturbed in mining operations and as mine closures draw nearer 
the accrued liability reflects the present value of contractual obligations of our customers and of washington group  the contract miner at the absaloka mine  to perform reclamation  we estimate that the present value of their combined obligations is million 
the table also does not reflect million  the amount held in escrow as of december  from contributions by customers for reclamation of the rosebud mine 
we estimate that the present value of our net obligation for final reclamation that is  the costs of final reclamation that are not the contractual responsibilities of others is million at december  represents quarterly dividends that are accumulated through and including january  as provided in the certificate of designation establishing the series a preferred stock  the holders of the series a preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends when  as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds of the corporation legally available therefore 
in general  dividends that are not paid cumulate  as provided in the certificate of designation 
the rova project s debt is not listed in the table above because  at december   we were required to account for our investment in the rova project using the equity method of accounting 
if we complete the rova acquisition  we will no longer account for our investment in the rova project using the equity method  and the rova project s debt will be fully consolidated on our financial statements with our debt and the debt of our subsidiaries 
the rova project had outstanding indebtedness of million at december   and the principal of that debt is payable from through growth and development strategy our growth and development strategy is founded on the ownership and operation of assets that generate profits 
we strive to identify assets that are low cost producers and environmental leaders and that supply customers who share our orientation for low cost production and our environmental concern 
we believe that we will be more likely to achieve success in niche markets 
our goal is to acquire stable  long term earnings 
we will use our nols to shield that income from regular us federal income tax 
the acquisitions we completed in exemplify this strategy 
among other things  the rosebud  jewett  beulah and savage mines are essentially adjacent to their principal customers  to which they deliver coal by conveyor belt or truck  and are the lowest cost producers for their respective customers 
these mines principal customers all employ modern emissions control technology 
these mines are party to long term contracts with their principal customers that generate stable earnings 
examples of our current development efforts include the following in  we signed an interest purchase agreement with lg e to acquire lg e s interest in the rova project 
in  we leased the rights to explore  drill  and produce coalbed methane gas on property that we own in southern colorado to petrogulf corporation for  and a royalty interest on production from that property 
petrogulf began drilling wells in  production began in  and we began earning royalties in the first quarter of in  as part of our transaction with knife river  we acquired rights to develop the lignite deposits at gascoyne  north dakota 
our subsidiary  westmoreland power  inc  then joined with mdu resources group  inc 
to pursue development of a baseloaded lignite fired power plant near gascoyne as part of the state of north dakota s lignite vision lv program 
lv is a partnership between north dakota and the lignite energy council lec that is administered by the north dakota industrial commission ndic 
westmoreland power and mdu executed a joint development agreement in  and we each own half of the venture that is seeking to develop the power plant 
in september  ndic awarded the westmoreland mdu joint venture up to million in matching funds to finance feasibility and technical studies 
in january  as a result of these studies  we and mdu sought additional support from ndic to study the feasibility of substituting a mw or mw power plant for the mw plant that had originally been proposed 
ndic awarded the funds sought  and we and mdu completed studies of generation technology  and lignite mining issues in air quality evaluation was completed in early and in may  we and mdu applied to the north dakota department of health for an air quality permit for a proposed mw plant 
an existing source of future income and cash flow relates to the caballo mine in campbell county  wyoming 
in connection with the acquisitions  we acquired the stock of horizon coal services  inc horizon s only asset is a royalty interest in coal reserves located at the caballo mine  which is owned by a company that is not affiliated with us 
the royalty of 
per ton covers the mining of million tons of coal  making the potential gross royalty amount million 
the latest mine plan projects that mining of coal subject to the royalty will begin in late we discuss financial aspects of the rova acquisition in more detail below under financial implications of the rova acquisition 
as a strategic matter  owning of the rova project would give us an additional long lived asset whose value  we believe  extends well beyond the expiration of the rova project s existing contracts with dominion virginia power in it also should enhance our ability to develop and implement strategies to restructure the project s contracts with its principal customer  dominion virginia power  and with the project s lenders  to the mutual benefit of all parties  including us  as owners 
the rova acquisition also would double the number of megawatts of generated power that we own and substantially expands the foundation for further growth of the power segment of our business 
such growth may include the development and construction of additional power generating units at the rova site  the gascoyne site or elsewhere 
such growth may also include the operation of power plants 
a subsidiary of lg e holds the contract to operate the rova project and will continue to hold that operating agreement after we acquire of the project 
however  upon the closing of the rova acquisition  we will acquire the exclusive right to negotiate the purchase of this lg e subsidiary  or some or all of its assets  including the rova operating agreement  before lg e sells them to any third party 
liquidity and capital resources as discussed in the overview section above  we believe that westmoreland mining s add on facility substantially improves our near term liquidity 
in addition  even though the requirements of westmoreland mining s basic term loan agreement  including debt service requirements  restrict our access to some of westmoreland mining s cash  westmoreland mining itself generates significant liquidity 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in cash from operations in compared to decreased primarily because our operating income declined 
our operating income declined principally because we sold less coal and incurred higher costs at the jewett mine  where unusually high rainfall disrupted production  and as a result of increases in the cost of commodities we consume at our operations 
we also had significantly lower distributions from the rova project in as compared to  because the project s lenders withheld million of which our share is million as a reserve for a disputed personal property assessment by halifax county  north carolina and in connection with a scheduled maintenance outage 
lastly  we made contributions to our defined benefit pension plans of million in  while no contributions were required in these reductions more than offset the positive impact of receiving a net retroactive payment of million from the owners of colstrip units working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase resulted primarily from additional borrowings of long term debt  an increase in the current portion of our deferred income tax assets and a decrease in the current portion of our postretirement medical costs  principally attributable to the payment of the retroactive premium assessed by the combined fund 
we used million of cash in investing activities in  million in and million in cash used in investing activities in included million of additions to property  plant and equipment for mine equipment and development projects 
cash used in investing activities in also included a million increase in our restricted cash accounts  pursuant to westmoreland mining s term loan agreement and as collateral for our surety bonds 
additions to property  plant and equipment in were million and increases in restricted cash accounts were million 
during  net proceeds from sales of assets of million included million cash received from the sale of dta and million received from the sale of land and mineral rights in colorado 
in  additions to property and equipment using cash totaled million  and we received million from the absaloka mine s mining contractor to settle a dispute regarding repair of the dragline at that mine 
also during  we deposited million into restricted cash accounts 
those deposits were offset by a million refund of collateral we received from the umwa 
we generated cash in financing activities of million in  comprised primarily of new borrowings of million of long term debt 
we used cash of million for the repayment of long term debt in we used cash of million in financing activities in  including million for the net repayment of long term debt and million for the net repayment of revolving debt 
cash used in financing activities in primarily represented repayment of long term debt of million and the net repayment of revolving debt of million 
dividends paid to westmoreland resources shareholder in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
consolidated cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million  including million at westmoreland mining  million at westmoreland resources  and million at our captive insurance subsidiary 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  including million at westmoreland mining  million at westmoreland resources  and million at the captive insurance subsidiary 
the cash at westmoreland mining is available to us through quarterly distributions  as described below 
the cash at westmoreland resources is available to us through dividends 
in addition  we had restricted cash and bond collateral  which were not classified as cash or cash equivalents  of million at december  and million at december  the restricted cash at december  included million in westmoreland mining s debt service and long term prepayment accounts 
the restricted cash at december  included million in westmoreland mining s debt service reserve and long term prepayment accounts 
at december   our reclamation  workers compensation and postretirement medical cost obligation bonds were collateralized by interest bearing cash deposits of million  which amounts we have classified as non current assets 
in addition  we had reclamation deposits of million at december  and million at december   which we received from customers of the rosebud mine to pay for reclamation 
we also had million in interest bearing debt reserve accounts for the rova project at december  this cash is restricted as to its use and is classified as part of our investment in independent power projects 
in early march  westmoreland mining entered into the add on facility 
this facility made million available to us in the add on facility permits westmoreland mining to undertake significant capital projects  principally at the rosebud and jewett mines  in the near term without adversely affecting cash available to westmoreland coal company 
the terms of the add on facility permit westmoreland mining to distribute this million to westmoreland coal company 
westmoreland mining distributed million to westmoreland coal company in and expects to distribute the balance in the original term loan agreement  which financed our acquisition of the rosebud  jewett  beulah  and savage mines  continues to restrict westmoreland mining s ability to make distributions to westmoreland coal company from ongoing operations 
until westmoreland mining has fully paid the original acquisition debt  which is scheduled for december   westmoreland mining may only pay westmoreland coal company a management fee and distribute to westmoreland coal company of westmoreland mining s surplus cash flow 
westmoreland mining is depositing the remaining into an account that will fund the million balloon payment due december  at the same time that westmoreland mining entered into the add on facility  it also extended its revolving credit facility to and reduced the amount of the facility to million 
westmoreland mining reduced the amount of the revolving facility to better align its capacity to its expected usage and borrowing base 
as of december   westmoreland mining had the entire million revolving facility available to borrow 
as of december   westmoreland coal company had its entire million revolving line of credit available to borrow 
on july   we filed a registration statement for a possible rights offering 
if the registration statement becomes effective  it would permit holders of our common stock to purchase additional shares of common stock 
as stated in the registration statement  the additional equity capital would be used to support our growth and development strategy and for general corporate purposes 
liquidity outlook significant anticipated variances between and we anticipate that the following events and developments  which we expect will occur in but which did not occur in  and the following events and developments  which we expect will not occur in but which did occur in  will affect our liquidity and our net income 
we discuss the prospective effects of the anticipated rova acquisition in more detail below 
the price adjustment required in july for the coal that we supply to colstrip units was finally determined in may the arbitrators decision resulted in a price increase 
the new price was effective as of july   covers coal we supplied to colstrip units from july  through may  and will remain in effect through the expiration of the contract 
in  we received a payment of over million from the owners of colstrip units  which represents the extra amount owed to us for coal supplied from july through may  including interest  net of applicable taxes and royalties 
we do not expect any comparable event in we expect increased sales in from the rosebud mine 
overall cost of sales should decrease  in part because the costs at the jewett mine associated with the excessive rainfall should not be repeated  and in part because we have taken steps described below at our operations 
we anticipate that capital expenditures related to our mining activities will be higher in than in we expect that most of the increase in will be associated with mine development at the absaloka  rosebud and beulah mines 
capital expenditures at the jewett mine are significant but comparable in both and we anticipate higher interest costs in because of the additional million borrowed in our results for reflect a negative impact of increased prospective and retroactive personal property taxes at the rova project 
our pre tax income was reduced by million for the accrual of our estimated cost 
also  the lender to the project is withholding funds in an amount equal to the total amount claimed by halifax county  which funds are normally available for distribution  until the claim has been resolved 
our share of the amount withheld is million 
we expect higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in than in due to continued capital expenditures at our mines and an increase in the carrying value of our capitalized asset retirement costs 
in  we paid the final million of the combined fund s retroactive assessment 
our cash payments for postretirement medical costs is expected to decrease to million in as compared to million in  in part because we have now fully paid this assessment 
we are challenging this assessment  as discussed in item legal proceedings 
during  we plan to complete implementation of a common  corporate wide enterprise resource planning  or information technology system to enhance our reporting and analysis capability 
the total investment in was approximately million  which represents most of the expected total costs 
we expect that the system will deliver an acceptable return on investment through improved efficiencies and reduced costs associated with our current  separate systems 
in  we adopted a long term incentive plan to promote the successful implementation of our strategic plan and link the compensation of our key managers to the appreciation in the price of our common stock 
the board of directors compensation benefits committee granted awards under this long term incentive plan with a variable value in   and the total expense for these awards in was million 
we are not able to predict the variable expense for these awards in new accounting rules require that we expense the value of stock options over their vesting periods  beginning no later than the third quarter of we have not determined the impact of this new requirement 
we have three defined benefit pension plans for full time employees 
we were required to contribute million to the plans in  and we expect to make additional contributions of million in additional contributions will likely also be required in future years unless the return on the plans investments materially improves or the plans funding requirements change 
in  we expect that our payments for amt will increase to million from payments of million in we expect that our amt nols will be fully utilized in  and that amt payments in and beyond will increase significantly 
our operating income declined in primarily because we sold less coal and incurred higher costs at the jewett mine  where unusually high rainfall disrupted production  and as a result of increases in the cost of commodities at our mines 
certain of our coal supply contracts allow us to recover the increased cost of commodities on a current basis 
other arrangements are in place under which the company s mining operations should recover in significant portions of the remaining past cost increases for commodities 
we are also exploring sales  production and mine design changes that could reduce the company s exposure to such events as excessive rainfall  uncontrollable cost escalations  and variable mining conditions at jewett and other operations going forward 
as a result of the difficulties at the jewett mine  we took no distributions from westmoreland mining for the third and fourth quarters of under westmoreland mining s term loan agreement  westmoreland mining is permitted to make quarterly distributions to westmoreland coal company subject to adjustment at year end based upon audited financial information 
for the year ended december   westmoreland mining distributed an amount that  based upon year end information  exceeded by million the annual amount permitted under the term loan agreement 
westmoreland mining intends to deduct that amount from future distributions to westmoreland coal company as permitted under the term loan agreement 
significant factors affecting our liquidity the matters discussed above focus on anticipated differences between and a number of non recurring events significantly influenced our results 
our operational performance  our financial results  and our liquidity may also be affected by all of the other matters discussed in this annual report on form k  including the legal proceedings discussed in item and the matters discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
primarily because of our size and the multitude of issues related to our transition from an eastern underground producer of coal  to a western niche surface producer with significant reliance on independent power operations  we have been subject to the impact of many matters beyond our control 
for all of the foregoing reasons  and while we anticipate that we will be profitable in  we cannot project our overall level of profitability 
financial implications of the rova acquisition on august   we signed an interest purchase agreement with a subsidiary of lg e energy llc 
in that agreement  we agreed to acquire the interest in the rova project that we do not currently own 
in november  dominion virginia power asserted that it had a right of first refusal with respect to lg e s interest 
for the reasons discussed in risk factors below  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the acquisition of lg e s interest in the rova project 
the financial implications of the rova transaction will depend significantly on when it is completed if at all  how we choose to finance the transaction  the terms of any such financing  and the terms of an agreement with dominion virginia power 
in evaluating the terms of any proposed financing or any proposed agreement with dominion virginia power  we start with the existing contracts that were negotiated initially when the project was developed 
the principal contracts are two power purchase and operating contracts  pursuant to which the rova project sells electricity to dominion virginia power  and the agreements between the rova project and its lenders that financed the project s construction 
annual principal payments on the project s debt are projected to increase from million in  to approximately million in  and approximately million in annual principal payments are projected to fall sharply thereafter until the project s debt is fully paid in the revenues under the power purchase contracts were structured to permit the rova project to make these principal payments  but the project s revenues and expenses do not correspond perfectly  and under the project s existing arrangements  cash flow from the project after payment of principal and interest is expected to decline from through we currently expect that completing the rova acquisition would increase our revenues  operating income  and net income over what we expect to receive from our existing ownership of the rova project  but the magnitude of the impact would depend in part on the factors described in the preceding paragraph 
we also expect that  through at least  the rova acquisition would increase our cash flow on an after tax basis over what we would have received from owning of the project  but the magnitude of the impact would again depend in part on the factors described above 
the alternative minimum tax also affects our return from the acquisition we anticipate that  if we acquire lg e s interest in the rova project  we would increase our alternative minimum taxable income and alternative minimum tax payments 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of the rules of the securities and exchange commission 
results of operations compared to coal operations 
we sold about million more tons of coal in than we did in the increase in tons sold in came from new or extended sales contracts at the rosebud and absaloka mines 
revenues increased at a greater rate primarily because  in  we received an arbitration award increasing the contract price for tons sold to colstrip units from our rosebud mine retroactive to july this resulted in the recognition in of additional revenue of million and related production taxes and royalties of million 
the increased price will continue through the expiration of the contract with colstrip units in in spite of the additional margin from this retroactive price increase  costs  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in compared to in this was mostly a result of weather related interruptions in at the jewett mine and increased costs for diesel fuel and electricity used at our mines 
the following table shows comparative coal revenues  sales volumes  cost of sales and percentage changes between the periods year ended change revenues thousands   volumes millions of equivalent coal tons cost of sales thousands   depreciation  depletion and amortization increased to million in compared to million in  primarily because we increased capital expenditures at the mines for both continued mine development and the replacement of mining equipment and because increased depreciation resulted from the increase in production levels 
there was also higher depletion due to an increase in capitalized asset retirement costs 
independent power 
our equity in earnings from independent power operations decreased to million in from million in the decrease is attributable to a million charge for retroactive personal property taxes  which are being challenged  and costs associated with a major five year scheduled maintenance outage 
during and  the rova project produced  and  megawatt hours  respectively  and achieved average capacity factors of and  respectively 
we also recognized  in equity in earnings in from our interest in the ft 
lupton project compared to  in costs and expenses 
selling and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in contributing to the decrease were lower expenses for both severance and long term incentive compensation plans  continued decrease in health care costs for active employees and decreased legal fees associated with coal contract negotiations and other litigation 
long term incentive compensation decreased to million in from million in this is a non cash expense until it is paid 
payments are currently being made over a five year period following maturity 
the compensation and benefits committee has elected to pay a portion of the awards in shares of common stock and future exercises of stock appreciation rights will be settled in common stock 
heritage health benefit costs increased to million in compared to million in four factors impacted these costs in  we increased our estimate of outstanding workers compensation costs by million based upon increased claims experience and revised actuarial projections 
in  our costs increased because there was a decrease in the amount by which our black lung trust was overfunded 
in  a decrease in discount rates increased costs for postretirement medical obligations 
in  costs included a million retroactive premium assessed by the combined fund 
interest expense was million in and interest associated with the larger amount of outstanding debt as a result of westmoreland mining s add on facility and increased use of westmoreland mining s revolver facility during the year was offset by lower interest payments due to the pay down of the acquisition financing obtained in interest income increased in because of larger restricted cash and surety bond collateral balances and interest of million associated with the arbitration decision relating to colstrip units results of operations compared to coal operations 
we sold about million more tons of coal in than we did in  but our coal revenues decreased million 
revenues declined because  for part of  the jewett mine benefited from a cost plus fees pricing structure in its contract with texas genco ii 
we sold more tons at all of our mines in than we did in  with the exception of the beulah mine  which was adversely affected by a longer than expected major maintenance outage at the coyote station  that mine s principal customer 
in addition  the rosebud mine was adversely affected by an unscheduled outage at the colstrip station  its principal customer 
costs  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in compared to in  again largely as a result of the lower average sales price in at the jewett mine 
also  the implementation of sfas no 
increased non cash accretion costs at all mines for future reclamation activities and reduced margins in the following table shows comparative coal revenues  sales volumes  cost of sales and percentage changes between the periods year ended change revenues thousands   volumes millions of equivalent coal tons cost of sales thousands   depreciation  depletion and amortization increased to million in compared to million in due to increased capital expenditures and increased depreciation resulting from the increase in production levels 
independent power 
our equity in earnings from independent power operations increased from million in to million in during and  the rova project produced  and  megawatt hours  respectively  and achieved average capacity factors of and  respectively 
also  we recognized  in equity in earnings in from our interest in the ft 
lupton project  most of which related to periods prior to costs and expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in contributing to the increase were higher heritage health benefit costs and a higher compensation expense for long term employee performance incentives 
we incurred increased legal fees associated with coal contract negotiations and litigation 
heritage health benefit costs were million in compared to million in five factors contributed to the increase the combined fund assessed the million retroactive premium discussed above 
we incurred an additional million expense for postretirement medical obligations  principally because of a change in the discount rate and inflation in medical costs 
we incurred an additional million expense resulting from negative actuarial valuation adjustments for our workers compensation and black lung obligations 
we eliminated million in previously recognized obligations to the umwa pension plan 
a redesign of our health care plans for active employees  including an increase in employees premium payments and aggressive management of medical expenses  reduced our health care costs for active employees in compared to long term incentive compensation increased from million in to million in this expense was entirely attributable to the performance unit plan  described above 
this expense is a non cash expense until it is paid 
as permitted by the plan  we paid about of the expense   in cash and  in shares of common stock in  leaving an obligation of million as of december  interest expense was million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease was mainly due to the continued repayment of westmoreland mining s debt 
interest income decreased in because of lower rates 
other income in includes a million gain in connection with the favorable judgment in the dispute with a customer of the ft 
drum power project that was sold 
terminal operations 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  effective june   we sold our interest in dta and recognized a pre tax gain of approximately million 
our consolidated financial statements for and earlier periods reflect dta as discontinued operations 
our share of operating losses from dta was approximately million for the six months we owned it in compared to million related to a full year s ownership in during  we expensed as a non cash impairment charge our remaining investment of million in dta as a result of continuing losses and an agreement by one of the terminal s other owners to sell its interest for a loss 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
we adopted sfas no 
during the first quarter of  as described in the section on critical accounting policies above 
the cumulative effect of the change was a gain of  net of tax expense of  we also reduced our recorded liability for mine reclamation from million to million as of january  and reduced the net book value of our property  plant and equipment from million to million as a result of adopting this standard 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment or sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
the company is required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of  beginning july  under sfas r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost  and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
the company is evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expects that the adoption of sfas r will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position 
the company has not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  it has not determined whether the adoption will result in changes to net income that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas included in the summary of significant accounting policies accompanying the consolidated financial statement  and it has not determined if it will elect to adopt the provisions of sfas r prior to july  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions or sfas sfas eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after june  and is required to be adopted by the company in the first quarter of the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition but does not expect it to have a material impact 
risk factors in addition to the trends and uncertainties described in items and of this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we are subject to the risks set forth below 
our coal mining operations are inherently subject to conditions that could affect levels of production and production costs at particular mines for varying lengths of time and could reduce our profitability 
our coal mining operations are all surface mines 
these mines are subject to conditions or events beyond our control that could disrupt operations  affect production and increase the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time and negatively affect our profitability 
these conditions or events include unplanned equipment failures  which could interrupt production and require us to expend significant sums to repair our capital equipment  including our draglines  the large machines we use to remove the soil that overlies coal deposits  geological conditions  such as variations in the quality of the coal produced from a particular seam  variations in the thickness of coal seams and variations in the amounts of rock and other natural materials that overlie the coal that we are mining  and weather conditions 
examples of recent conditions or events of these types include the following in the first quarter of  electrical components on the dragline at our savage mine failed 
this reduced overburden removal and increased costs at that mine for a period of days while the dragline was being repaired 
in the first quarter of  our beulah mine experienced sloughage  a condition in which the side of the pit partially collapses and must be stabilized before mining can continue 
this limited use of the dragline at that mine for a period of days while the walls of the pit were being stabilized 
in the second quarter of  our jewett mine received approximately more rain than normal  impeding production 
our revenues and profitability could suffer if our customers reduce or suspend their coal purchases 
in  we sold approximately of our coal under long term contracts and about three fourths of our coal under contracts that obligate our customers to purchase all or almost all of their coal requirements from us  or which give us the right to supply all of the plant s coal  lignite or fuel requirements 
three of our contracts  with the owners of the limestone electric generating station  colstrip units and with colstrip units  accounted for  and  respectively  of our coal revenues in the contract with the owners of colstrip units accounted for this percentage of our revenues because we received  in  an arbitration award that covered coal delivered to colstrip units from july interruption in the purchases by or operations of our principal customers could significantly affect our revenues and profitability 
unscheduled maintenance outages at our customers power plants and unseasonably moderate weather are examples of conditions that might cause our customers to reduce their purchases 
four of our five mines are dedicated to supplying customers located adjacent to or near the mines  and these mines may have difficulty identifying alternative purchasers of their coal if their existing customers suspend or terminate their purchases 
disputes relating to our coal supply agreements could harm our financial results 
from time to time  we may have disputes with customers under our coal supply agreements 
these disputes could be associated with claims by our customers that may affect our revenue and profitability 
any dispute that resulted in litigation could cause us to pay significant legal fees  which could also affect our profitability 
by way of example  we have entered into a settlement agreement with texas genco ii that addresses contract disputes through  but differences may occur as to the interpretation of various contract provisions after we may not be able to complete the rova acquisition 
in august  we agreed to acquire from lg e the interest in the rova project that we do not currently own 
in november  dominion virginia power asserted that it had a right of first refusal with respect to lg e s interest in this project 
in view of dominion virginia power s claim  there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire lg e s interest in the rova project 
even if we are able to resolve the claim of dominion virginia power  the completion of the rova transaction is subject to the following conditions specified in our interest purchase agreement with lg e both we and lg e must have performed and complied with  in all material respects  the obligations and covenants that we and lg e are required to perform and comply with prior to the closing 
our representations and warranties  and the representations and warranties of lg e  must be true and correct in all material respects on the closing date 
since august   there must not have been a material adverse effect on the assets  business  condition  or results of operations of the partnership that owns the rova project  the condition  use  or operation of the rova project itself  the payments owed to the rova project by dominion virginia power under the power purchase agreement  or lg e s interest in the rova project 
we and lg e must have received all necessary consents to the transaction from all regulatory authorities and third parties  including the consents of the lenders to the rova project 
we must have obtained replacement insurance that satisfies the insurance requirements of the rova project s credit agreement with its lenders 
lg e and its affiliates must have been released from their obligations under the rova project s existing letters of credit  and the beneficiaries of those letters of credit must not have drawn under them 
the closing of the rova acquisition is also subject to other customary conditions 
we are currently negotiating with dominion virginia power to address its claim  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to resolve this claim on a basis that we consider satisfactory for the company 
in addition  many of the conditions to the closing of the rova acquisition are beyond our control  and there can be no assurance that those conditions will be satisfied 
we are a party to numerous legal proceedings  some of which  if determined unfavorably to us  could result in significant monetary damages 
we are a party to several legal proceedings  which are described more fully in this annual report on form k under item legal proceedings 
adverse outcomes in some or all of the pending cases could result in substantial damages against us or harm our business 
we currently own a interest in the rova project  which is located in halifax county  north carolina  and we have agreed to purchase the interest that we do not currently own 
halifax county asserts that the rova project owes million in back taxes  penalties and interest 
if we complete the rova acquisition  lg e has agreed to indemnify the rova project for one half of this amount 
we acquired the rosebud and jewett mines and other assets from entech  inc  a subsidiary of the montana power company  in april under our agreement with entech  the final purchase price is subject to adjustment 
in june  entech proposed adjustments that would increase the purchase price by approximately million 
in july  we objected to entech s adjustments and proposed our own adjustments  which would result in a substantial decrease in the purchase price 
in june  entech and touch america holdings  inc  the successor to the montana power company  filed bankruptcy petitions 
in march  we received notice that entech and touch america had commenced an adversary proceeding against us in the bankruptcy court  seeking payment of approximately million 
we filed an answer  a motion to dismiss and a claim for indemnification 
the bankruptcy court has referred the claims regarding the purchase price adjustment dispute to the courts of the state of new york 
the parties subsequently agreed to refer the purchase price adjustment issues to an independent accountant who has concluded his review 
our claim for indemnification is now set for trial in october in the us district court in delaware 
we may not be able to manage our expanding operations effectively  which could impair our profitability 
at the end of  we owned one mine and employed people 
in the spring of  we acquired the rosebud  jewett  beulah and savage mines from entech and knife river corporation  and at the end of  we employed people 
this growth has placed significant demands on our management as well as our resources and systems 
one of the principal challenges associated with our growth has been  and we believe will continue to be  our need to attract and retain highly skilled employees and managers 
if we are unable to attract and retain the personnel we need to manage our increasingly large and complex operations  our ability to manage our operations effectively and to pursue our business strategy could be compromised 
our growth and development strategy could require significant resources and may not be successful 
we regularly seek opportunities to make additional strategic acquisitions  to expand existing businesses  to develop new operations and to enter related businesses 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or development opportunities  or complete any acquisition or project  on terms that are favorable to us 
acquisitions  investments and other growth projects involve risks that could harm our operating results  including difficulties in integrating acquired and new operations  diversions of management resources  debt incurred in financing such activities and unanticipated problems and liabilities 
we anticipate that we would finance acquisitions and development activities by using our existing capital resources  borrowing under existing bank credit facilities  issuing equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness 
we may not have sufficient available capital resources or access to additional capital to execute potential acquisitions or take advantage of development opportunities 
our expenditures for postretirement medical and life insurance benefits could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect 
we provide various postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to current and former employees and their dependents 
we estimate the amounts of these obligations based on assumptions described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies postretirement benefits and pension obligations 
we accrue amounts for these obligations  which are unfunded  and we pay as costs are incurred 
if our assumptions change  the amount of our obligations could increase  and if our assumptions are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than we anticipate 
we estimate that our gross obligation for postretirement medical and life insurance benefits was million at december  we had an accrued liability for postretirement medical and life insurance benefits of million at december   and we will accrue an additional million over the next ten years  as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
we regularly revise our estimates  and the amount of our accrued obligations is subject to change 
we have a significant amount of debt  which imposes restrictions on us and may limit our flexibility  and a decline in our operating performance may materially affect our ability to meet our future financial commitments and liquidity needs 
as of december   our total indebtedness was approximately million  which included westmoreland mining s obligations under its term loan agreement  including the add on facility described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview revenues and expenses  sources and uses of cash 
we will assume significant non recourse debt upon completion of the rova acquisition  we may incur additional indebtedness to finance the rova acquisition and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future  including indebtedness under our two existing revolving credit facilities 
westmoreland mining s term loan agreement restricts its ability to distribute cash to westmoreland coal company through and limits the types of transactions that westmoreland mining and its subsidiaries can engage in with westmoreland coal company and our other subsidiaries 
westmoreland mining executed the term loan agreement in and used the proceeds to finance its acquisition of the rosebud  jewett  beulah and savage mines 
the final payment on this indebtedness  which we call westmoreland mining s acquisition debt  is in the amount of million and is due on december  after payment of principal and interest  of westmoreland mining s surplus cash flow is dedicated to an account that is expected to fund this final payment 
westmoreland mining has pledged or mortgaged substantially all of its assets and the assets of the rosebud  jewett  beulah and savage mines  and we have pledged all of our member interests in westmoreland mining  as security for westmoreland mining s indebtedness 
in addition  westmoreland mining must comply with financial ratios and other covenants specified in the agreements with its lenders 
failure to comply with these ratios and covenants or to make regular payments of principal and interest could result in an event of default 
a substantial portion of our cash flow must be used to pay principal of and interest on our indebtedness and is not available to fund working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate uses 
in addition  the degree to which we are leveraged could have other important consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate requirements  and limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and in the industry 
if our or westmoreland mining s operating performance declines  or if we or westmoreland mining do not have sufficient cash flows and capital resources to meet our debt service obligations  we or westmoreland mining may be forced to sell assets  seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
if westmoreland mining were to default on its debt service obligations  a note holder may be able to foreclose on assets that are important to our business 
at january   the rova project had total debt of approximately million 
the rova project s credit agreement restricts its ability to distribute cash  contains financial ratios and other covenants  and is secured by a pledge of the project and substantially all of the project s assets 
if the rova project fails to comply with these ratios and covenants or fails to make regular payments of principal and interest  an event of default could occur 
a substantial portion of the rova project s cash flow must be used to pay principal of and interest on its indebtedness and is not available to us 
if the rova project were to default on its debt service obligations  a creditor may be able to foreclose on assets that are important to our business 
if the cost of obtaining new reclamation bonds and renewing existing reclamation bonds continues to increase  our profitability could be reduced 
federal and state laws require that we provide bonds to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining 
we must post a bond before we obtain a permit to mine any new area 
these bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis and have become increasingly expensive 
bonding companies are requiring that applicants collateralize a portion of their obligations to the bonding company 
in  we paid approximately million in premiums for reclamation bonds and posted approximately million in collateral  in addition to the collateral that we had previously posted  for those bonds 
any capital that we provide to collateralize our obligations to our bonding companies is not available to support our other business activities 
if the cost of our reclamation bonds continues to increase  our profitability could be reduced 
our financial position could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain our coal act bonds 
the coal act established the umwa benefit plan  or plan 
we are required to secure three years of our obligations to that plan by posting a surety bond or a letter of credit or collateralizing our obligations with cash 
we presently secure these obligations with two bonds  one in an amount of approximately million and one in an amount of approximately million 
in december  the issuer of our million bond indicated a desire to exit the business of bonding coal act obligations 
in february  this company renewed our coal act bond 
although we believe that the issuer of this bond must continue to renew the bond so long as we do not default on our obligations to the plan  there can be no assurance that the issuer of this bond will not attempt to cancel the bond 
if either of the companies that issue our coal act bonds were to cancel or fail to renew our bonds  we may be required to post another bond or secure our obligations with a letter of credit or cash 
at this time  we are not aware of any other company that would provide a surety bond to secure obligations under the coal act 
we do not believe that we could now obtain a letter of credit without collateralizing that letter of credit in full with cash 
any capital that we might provide to collateralize such a letter of credit or secure our obligations under the coal act would not be available to support our other business activities 
our insurance costs may increase  which could increase our expenses and reduce our profitability 
our insurance costs increased from july through december  and we believe that insurance costs have generally increased throughout the mining industry 
we have been able to address a portion of these costs by organizing westmoreland risk management ltd  our insurance subsidiary  and retaining a portion of the risk associated with our operations 
however  westmoreland risk management has limited capacity 
our insurance costs may increase in the future  and any such increase would increase our expenses and thereby reduce our profitability 
we face competition for sales to new and existing customers  and the loss of sales or a reduction in the prices we receive under new or renewed contracts would lower our revenues and could reduce our profitability 
approximately one third of the coal tonnage that we will produce in will be sold under long term contracts to power plants that take delivery of our coal from common carrier railroads 
all of the absaloka mine s sales are delivered by rail and about of the rosebud mine s and beulah mine s sales are delivered by rail 
contracts covering of those rail tons are scheduled to expire between december and december as a general matter  plants that take coal by rail can buy their coal from many different suppliers 
we will face significant competition  primarily from mines in the southern powder river basin of wyoming  to renew our long term contracts with our rail served customers  and for contracts with new rail served customers 
many of our competitors are larger and better capitalized than we are and have coal with a lower sulfur and ash content than our coal 
as a result  our competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies for their coal supply contracts than we can 
if our existing customers fail to renew their existing contracts with us on terms that are at least equivalent to those in effect today  or if we are unable to replace our existing contracts with contracts of equal size and profitability from new customers  our revenues and profitability would be reduced 
approximately two thirds of the coal tonnage that we will sell in will be delivered under long term contracts to power plants located adjacent to our mines 
we will face somewhat less competition to renew these contracts upon their expiration  both because of the transportation advantage we enjoy by being located adjacent to these customers and because most of these customers would be required to invest additional capital to obtain rail access to alternative sources of coal 
our jewett mine is an exception because our customer has already built rail unloading and associated facilities that are being used to take coal from the southern powder river basin as permitted under our contract with that customer 
stricter environmental regulations  including the epa s proposed rule relating to mercury  could reduce the demand for coal as a fuel source and cause the volume of our sales to decline 
coal contains impurities  including sulfur  mercury  nitrogen and other elements or compounds  many of which are released into the air when coal is burned 
stricter environmental regulation of emissions from coal fired electric generating plants could increase the costs of using coal  thereby reducing demand for coal as a fuel source generally  and could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of utility power plants in the future 
the us environmental protection agency  or epa  has proposed regulations that could increase the costs of operating coal fired power plants  including the rova project 
congress is considering legislation that would have this same effect 
because different types of coal vary in their chemical composition and combustion characteristics  the proposed legislation and regulations could also alter the relative competitiveness among coal suppliers and coal types 
depending on the final forms of the rules or statutes that are ultimately adopted  any or all of our mines could be disadvantaged  and notwithstanding our coal supply contracts we could lose all or a portion of our sales volumes and face increased pressure to reduce the price for our coal  thereby reducing our revenues  our profitability and the value of our coal reserves 
on january   the epa issued the proposed national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants  or mercury rule  which proposes to regulate emissions of mercury by electric generating units  or egus 
the epa issued a supplemental proposed rule on march  these proposals contain three alternative methods for regulating emissions of mercury  including two alternatives that would establish standards of performance and cap and trade programs  and one alternative that would require egus to meet an emissions limit that is based on the installation of controls known as maximum achievable control technologies  or mact 
the mact alternative would limit the amount of mercury that could be emitted from lignite burning egus to pounds of mercury for every trillion btu those units produce  commencing as early as mercury emissions from the limestone station  which burns lignite produced by our jewett mine  are higher than this level  and mercury emissions from the coyote station  which burns lignite produced by our beulah mine  may be higher than this level 
according to the epa  there are neither precombustion techniques nor proven technologies that are currently commercially available for reducing mercury emissions from lignite burning egus to pounds of mercury per trillion btu produced  and there is also currently no proven technology for accurately measuring the mercury content in emissions 
if the epa were to adopt a version of the mercury rule that limits emissions of mercury to pounds for every trillion btu produced from lignite burning plants  then sales from the jewett mine or beulah mine could be significantly reduced  and if the epa were to adopt any version of the mercury rule  we could face increased pressure to reduce the price for our lignite to help defray the cost of complying with the regulations 
the epa has announced that it expects to adopt some version of the mercury rule by march  the market s reaction to proposed environmental regulations and legislation may also affect the competitiveness of coal from our mines 
market prices for sulfur dioxide emission allowances have increased from in to about at the end of this market appreciation began in late with speculation on the epa s proposed clean air interstate rule  which would effectively reduce the supply of such allowances by half in and by two thirds in the absaloka mine presents an example of competitive conditions confronting the company 
coal produced by the absaloka mine contains about pounds of sulfur dioxide per million btu  as compared to competing southern powder river basin sprb coal  which contains pounds of sulfur dioxide per million btu on average 
utility power plants are required under the clean air act amendments to surrender one emissions allowance for each ton of sulfur dioxide emitted during each year 
as discussed above under business governmental regulation proposed environmental rules and legislation  we anticipate that the epa will adopt a version of the cair on march   if congress has not adopted clear skies legislation 
the absaloka mine s contracts with its customers expire in and  and depending on the reaction of the market for emission allowances to the final legislation or rules  the competitiveness of absaloka coal could be reduced  we could lose all or a portion of our sales from the absaloka mine  and we could face increased pressure to reduce the price for absaloka coal  thereby reducing our revenues  our profitability  and the value of the mine s coal reserves 
new legislation or regulations in the united states aimed at limiting emissions of greenhouse gases could increase the cost of using coal or restrict the use of coal  which could reduce demand for our coal  cause our profitability to suffer and reduce the value of our assets 
a variety of international and domestic environmental initiatives are currently aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases  such as carbon dioxide  which is emitted when coal is burned 
if these initiatives were to be successful  the cost to our customers of using coal could increase  or the use of coal could be restricted 
this could cause the demand for our coal to decrease or the price we receive for our coal to fall  and the demand for coal generally might diminish 
restrictions on the use of coal or increases in the cost of burning coal could cause us to lose sales and revenues  cause our profitability to decline or reduce the value of our coal reserves 
demand for our coal could also be reduced by environmental regulations at the state level 
environmental regulations by the states in which our mines are located  or in which the generating plants they supply operate  may negatively affect demand for coal in general or for our coal in particular 
for example  texas has passed regulations requiring all fossil fuel fired generating facilities in the state to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions beginning in may in january  we entered into a supplemental settlement agreement with texas genco ii pursuant to which the limestone station must purchase a specified volume of lignite from the jewett mine 
in order to burn this lignite without violating the texas nitrogen oxide regulations  the limestone station is blending our lignite with coal  produced by others in the southern powder river basin  and using emissions credits 
considerations involving the texas nitrogen oxide regulations might affect the demand for lignite from the jewett mine in the period after  which is the last year covered by the supplemental settlement agreement 
texas genco ii might claim that it is less expensive for the limestone station to comply with the texas nitrogen oxide regulations by switching to a blend that contains relatively more coal from the southern powder river basin and relatively less of our lignite 
other states are evaluating various legislative and regulatory strategies for improving air quality and reducing emissions from electric generating units 
passage of other state specific environmental laws could reduce the demand for our coal 
we have significant reclamation and mine closure obligations 
if the assumptions underlying our accruals are materially inaccurate  or if we are required to honor reclamation obligations that have been assumed by our customers or contractors  we could be required to expend greater amounts than we currently anticipate  which could affect our profitability in future periods 
we are responsible under federal and state regulations for the ultimate reclamation of the mines we operate 
in some cases  our customers and contractors have assumed these liabilities by contract and have posted bonds or have funded escrows to secure their obligations 
we estimate our future liabilities for reclamation and other mine closing costs from time to time based on a variety of assumptions 
if our assumptions are incorrect  we could be required in future periods to spend more on reclamation and mine closing activities than we currently estimate  which could harm our profitability 
likewise  if our customers or contractors default on the unfunded portion of their contractual obligations to pay for reclamation  we could be forced to make these expenditures ourselves and the cost of reclamation could exceed any amount we might recover in litigation  which would also increase our costs and reduce our profitability 
we estimate that our gross reclamation and mine closing liabilities  which are based upon permit requirements and our experience  were million with a present value of million at december  of these liabilities  our customers have assumed a gross aggregate of million and have secured a portion of these obligations by posting bonds in the amount of million and funding reclamation escrow accounts that currently hold approximately million  in each case at december  we estimate that our gross obligation for final reclamation that is not the contractual responsibility of others was million at december   and that the present value of our net obligation for final reclamation that is not the contractual responsibility of others was million at december  our profitability could be affected by unscheduled outages at the power plants we supply or own or if the scheduled maintenance outages at the power plants we supply or own last longer than anticipated 
scheduled and unscheduled outages at the power plants that we supply could reduce our coal sales and revenues  because any such plant would not use coal while it was undergoing maintenance 
we cannot anticipate if or when unscheduled outages may occur 
our profitability could be affected by unscheduled outages at the rova project or if scheduled outages at the rova project last longer than we anticipate 
for example  the rova i unit is scheduled to be out of service for days in april and may the rova project s contract with dominion virginia power is structured so that our annual revenues will not be adversely affected by this outage 
however  if maintenance uncovers matters beyond those anticipated  the outage could be prolonged beyond the scheduled period  which could reduce the rova project s profitability and our revenues 
in addition  if the maintenance uncovers a matter that must be remedied or repaired  the cost of those repairs may also adversely affect the rova project s profitability 
increases in the cost of the fuel  electricity and materials we use to operate our mines could affect our profitability 
under several of our existing coal supply agreements  our mines bear the cost of the diesel fuel  lubricants and other petroleum products  electricity  and other materials and supplies necessary to operate their draglines and other mobile equipment 
the prices of many of these commodities have increased significantly in the last year  and continued escalation of these costs would hurt our profitability 
if we experience unanticipated increases in the capital expenditures we expect to make over the next several years  our profitability could suffer 
over the next several years  we anticipate making significant capital expenditures  principally at the rosebud and jewett mines  in order to add to and refurbish our machinery and equipment and prepare new areas for mining 
we also expect to begin implementing a new enterprise resource planning system in the costs of any of these expenditures could exceed our expectations  which could reduce our profitability and divert our capital resources from other uses 
our ability to operate effectively and achieve our strategic goals could be impaired if we lose key personnel 
our future success is substantially dependent upon the continued service of our key senior management personnel  particularly christopher k 
seglem  our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer 
we do not have key person life insurance policies on mr 
seglem or any other employees 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could make it more difficult for us to pursue our business goals 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law  and our stockholder rights plan  may have anti takeover effects that could prevent a change of control of our company that you may consider favorable  and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect some types of corporate actions 
in addition  a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our stockholder rights plan  which was initially adopted by our board of directors in early and amended and restated in february our ability to issue preferred stock in the future may influence the willingness of an investor to seek to acquire our company 
these provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of westmoreland 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including the effects of changes in commodity prices as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company  through its subsidiaries wri and wml  produces and sells coal to third parties from coal mining operations in montana  texas and north dakota and through its subsidiary  wellc  produces and sells electricity and steam to third parties from its independent power projects located in north carolina and colorado 
nearly all of the company s coal production and all of its electricity and steam production are sold through long term contracts with customers 
these long term contracts serve to minimize the company s exposure to revenue volatility due to changes in commodity prices although some of the company s contracts are adjusted periodically based upon market prices 
however  the company is subject to variable costs for commodities it consumes such as diesel fuel  electricity and steel 
the company has not entered into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to changes in commodity prices  and was not a party to any such contracts at december  interest rate risk the company and its subsidiaries are subject to interest rate risk on its debt obligations 
long term debt obligations have both fixed and variable interest rates  and the company s revolving line of credit has a variable rate of interest indexed to either the prime rate or libor 
interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates as of december  based on the balances outstanding as of december   a one percent change in the prime interest rate or libor would increase interest expense by approximately  on an annual basis 
the company s heritage health benefit costs are also impacted by interest rate changes because its pension  pneumoconiosis and post retirement medical benefit obligations are recorded on a discounted basis
