item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general as a growing business in an expanding market  we faced many challenges in  including we were overly dependent on outside plastic recycling companies and virgin resin producers and in some cases the resultant product quality 
as some of our suppliers faced their own challenges in the face of rapidly rising plastic scrap prices  aert was increasingly left short of adequate input and quality materials for our composite board extrusion lines to keep up with continued customer requirements and substantial sales growth 
this forced us to purchase alternative feedstock  such as virgin polyethylene  to keep our factories running and meet our obligations to our customers 
the higher priced input materials pushed up our cost of goods sold and depressed our gross margin 
attempting to use lower cost and lower quality feedstock in some cases caused a substantial decrease in efficiencies and higher overall costs 
we were overly dependent on one customer 
since  we have sold our decking products exclusively to weyerhaeuser  who resold it through their distribution system 
over time  weyerhaeuser s business strategy has shifted and we believed that their distribution system was not allowing us to grow and adequately compete in all market segments 
in particular  their reluctance to take and hold inventory during the fourth quarter for sale to independent lumber dealers over the last several years has limited our growth and restricted our working capital 
as a rapidly growing company  we require increasing amounts of working capital 
we suffered from a lack of adequate working capital during  the effect of which was to hold back our capital expansion and efficiency programs 
a major contributor to this inadequacy was the failure to receive the full amount of our fire insurance claim in see item legal proceedings our aggressive growth objectives have strained our human capital resources and we are working to hire  train  and staff additional supervisory and management personnel  and  we believe that an excessive overhang of common stock warrants limits institutional participation in the market for our stock in the near term  which depress our stock price and limits access to additional equity capital see note stockholder equity 
looking to and beyond  we are focused on alleviating these structural impediments to our growth and profitability 
for example we are investing heavily in adding in house plastic recycling capacity  we are further automating our manufacturing facilities  we continue to focus on increasing gross margins through price increases and increased efficiencies  we have renegotiated the distribution arrangements with weyerhaeuser to allow us to sell decking products to other customers  though weyerhaeuser retains an exclusive right to purchase choicedek products for re sale to lowe s home improvement stores 
over of weyerhaeuser s purchases from us for re sale to lowe s 
for  we have introduced our moistureshield line of decking and will have more focus on its production and sale in this and coming years  we are in discussions with additional sources of working capital 
we expect to finalize at least one new working capital arrangement in  we are aggressively recruiting new aert associates for senior and middle management levels

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  grew compared to due to a product mix that included a higher percentage of value added products  including the new choicedek premium embossed  which accounts for of the increase  restoration of the junction plant to its pre fire capacity  which accounts for of the increase  and increased productivity  which resulted from various capital projects that increased output and reduced manufacturing waste 
productivity gains account for the remaining of the increase 
in  demand for our products exceeded our manufacturing capacity 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold  increased in versus cost of goods sold is directly related to sales  which increased 
cost of goods sold as a percent of sales thus decreased from of sales to of sales  which raised our gross margin from to 
all three accounting components of cost of goods sold cost of materials  direct labor  and manufacturing overhead decreased as a percent of sales 
direct labor costs decreased as a result of automation projects and from more emphasis on training and productivity improvement programs 
manufacturing overhead decreased as we increased output at a faster rate than we increased overhead spending 
we believe further gains in both direct labor and manufacturing are possible as we expand output 
the cost of materials in was lower  as a percent of sales  than in because we expanded our plastic processing capacity at the lowell  arkansas and alexandria  louisiana facilities and are continually seeking new sources of lower cost waste plastic materials 
also during  we used a substantial amount of plastic inventory that was acquired in earlier periods at less than market prices 
this helped to offset rising material costs through the year by lessening our dependence on outside suppliers 
we are working to further increase our in house plastic processing capacity  which has gone from in to in the first quarter our goal is to reach in house capacity 
we also focused on better material handling techniques and efficiencies in order to further reduce manufacturing waste and handling costs 
increasing our in house plastic processing facilities is intended to lower our variable cost of purchasing recycled plastic scrap  but also increases our manufacturing overhead and additional processing costs 
with increased fixed overhead for recycling and processing infrastructure  sufficient volumes  and throughputs are required to lower overall costs 
lower cost poor quality plastic scrap can thus cause decreased throughputs and significant increases in overall cost 
this effect contributed somewhat to higher overall manufacturing costs and lower gross margin in the fourth quarter of overall  we were successful in reducing cost of goods sold as a percent of sales by improved focus and investing in new facilities  ie productivity gains offset rising material costs  which helped us to achieve an increase in operating income of million versus over the next two years and we expect further increases in our cost of raw materials as a percent of sales before the market reaches equilibrium and prices stabilize 
there is no assurance that our assessment of future market conditions is correct  however  and sustained increases in the cost of acquiring raw materials would have a negative impact on our profitability and ability to increase shareholder value 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative cost increased in compared to as a result of increases in sales  customer service  and corporate personnel expenses  along with general increases in corporate costs to manage our growing business 
however  as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative costs decreased 
some of the major components of selling  general  and administrative costs are salaries  commissions  advertising and promotion  travel and 
table of contents entertainment and professional fees 
overall  as a percent of sales the preceding cost categories were lower in when compared to net income net income before extraordinary item was million compared to a net loss before extraordinary item of  for the prior year an improvement of million 
compared to  net income before extraordinary item increased due to increased sales  lower manufacturing costs as a percentage of sales  and lower selling and administrative costs as a percentage of sales 
net income after extraordinary item was million compared to million for the prior year  a decrease of  or 
insurance proceeds received to reimburse costs of reconstructing the junction facility following a march fire resulted in a  extraordinary gain for compared to an extraordinary gain of million in see extraordinary item below 
extraordinary item there was a major fire at the junction  texas facility in the junction facility was fully insured 
damage caused by the fire required us to write down gross assets by approximately million 
we simultaneously adjusted accumulated depreciation on those assets by million  resulting in a net book value decrease in assets of about  at december   we had invested approximately million in reconstructing the junction facility 
insurance proceeds received to reimburse costs incurred to reconstruct the facility resulted in a gain of  for the year ended december  through december   the total extraordinary gain recorded as a result of the fire was  total insurance proceeds received through december  in connection with the fire was million 
in addition  we had initially booked an additional receivable of approximately  and related income in the first quarter of for additional amounts we expect to collect from the insurers related to such matter 
however  such claims are now being contested by the insurer and  although we intend to vigorously pursue the collection of such claims  we have  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  reversed any receivable or income for the fiscal year attributable to such disputed claims unless and until such claims are collected 
see item legal proceedings contingencies we are in dispute with zanett lombardier  ltd 
over  in penalty interest on a  bridge loan that we repaid in repayment included nominal interest from the date of the loan at per annum  but we dispute the additional penalty interest that zanett lombardier is seeking  which zanett lombardier asserts should be accruing at per annum 
nonetheless  we have accrued a liability for this entire amount 
see note to the financial statements 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased national demand for our choicedek premium products and investment in plant automation and efficiency projects caused net sales at the springdale facility to increase in net sales from the junction facility decreased versus due to the march fire that temporarily shut down plant operations 
the initial restoration project completed in may  included the rebuilding of one extrusion line that had been partially damaged  electrical system replacement  and roof replacement 
the second extrusion line began operations in april cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased significantly versus to of sales from of sales  which decreased our gross margin by seven percentage points 
of the increase was due to the rising cost of acquiring recyclable plastics 
a sharp increase in petroleum prices early in the year drove up virgin resin prices  which caused industrial consumers to turn to recycled plastics  which then forced up the price that we had to pay for the plastic scrap that we use in our manufacturing process 
higher manufacturing overhead caused the other of the decrease in gross margin 
most of the relative cost increase is a result of reduced sales over which to allocate fixed operating expenses  which drives up the cost of manufacturing each unit 
direct labor  as percent of sales  was constant from to to help offset rising material costs  we expanded the plastic recovery process capacity at our lowell  arkansas facility and are testing new sources of scrap polyethylene that could reduce our materials cost 
selling and administrative expenses the increase in selling and administrative costs as a percentage of sales in was the result of the decrease in revenue at the junction facility and the additional sales staff and increased marketing and brand building expenses related to decking sales 
these items resulted in higher unit costs and lower absorption of overhead expenses 
income income before the extraordinary gain decreased from to primarily because we had to pay more for raw materials and junction sales decreased significantly due to the fire 
additionally  net interest expense increased approximately  in over  due primarily to the completion of the bond financing in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in higher interest costs and the write off of  in debt issuance costs related to the arkansas state bank loan 

table of contents extraordinary item there was a major fire at the junction  texas facility in the junction facility was fully insured 
damage caused by the fire required us to write down gross assets by approximately million 
we simultaneously adjusted accumulated depreciation on those assets by million  resulting in a net book value decrease in assets of about  at december   we had invested approximately million in reconstructing the junction facility 
insurance proceeds received to reimburse costs incurred to reconstruct the facility resulted in a gain of  through december  additionally  we received  in business interruption insurance during  including  to replace lost income and  to cover fixed expenses 
at december   approximately  was included in accounts receivable for expected insurance reimbursements  as these proceeds had been received subsequent to year end 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had a working capital deficit of million compared to a working capital deficit of million at december  excluding the million spent to reconstruct the junction facility  we spent approximately million on capital expansion during expenditures were primarily for increasing our plastic processing capacity at our lowell and alexandria facilities in order to better control our raw material costs  and for automation equipment in our extrusion plants 
at december   the working capital deficit included total current liabilities of approximately million  of which million was for accrued payroll expense and other accrued liabilities  million was in payables and million was a combination of short term notes payable and the current portion of long term debt 
the working capital deficit reflects management s decision to pay for its capital expansion using cash generated from operations 
additionally  pursuant to our bond agreement  we are required to maintain a debt service reserve fund in the amount of approximately million  which is classified as a non current asset in our balance sheet 
cash increased  to million at december  from december  significant components of that increase were i cash provided by operating activities of million  which consisted of the net income for the period of million increased by depreciation and amortization of million and decreased by other uses of cash of approximately  ii cash used in investing activities of million  and iii cash used in financing activities of approximately  payments on notes during the period were million  and proceeds from the issuances of notes amounted to million 
at december   we had bonds and notes payable in the amount of million  of which million was current notes payable and the current portion of long term debt 
on october   we finalized a long term financing package with the city of springdale  arkansas and allstate insurance company that resulted in the release to us of most of the funds previously held in the restricted bond escrow fund 
the package consisted of million tax exempt industrial development bonds and a million loan that is subordinated to the bonds 
net proceeds from the financing were used to repay short term loans  pay down accounts payable incurred to develop qualified solid waste disposal facilities  purchase the springdale  arkansas extrusion facility  purchase the lowell  arkansas plastic facility  pay issuance fees  and provide limited capital for further expansion 
the obligations are secured by substantially all of our real estate assets and personal property  although provision is made for us to incur additional working capital lines of credit subject to compliance with financial covenants that would be secured by accounts receivable and inventory on a basis senior to obligations 
marjorie s 
brooks  our largest shareholder  personally guaranteed repayment of up to million of the tax exempt bonds 
through december   we had received million in insurance proceeds related to the march junction plant fire  including amounts for lost income reimbursement  and had invested approximately million in reconstructing the junction facility 
we recorded  in business interruption insurance during  including  to replace lost income and  to cover fixed expenses 
insurance proceeds received to reimburse costs incurred to reconstruct the facility resulted in a gain of  for the year ended december  we believe the insurance claim of million for the replacement of the building and contents will be settled by the end of see item legal proceedings since the 
table of contents junction facility has reached the production level at which it operated prior to the fire  we will no longer receive business interruption insurance proceeds for lost income reimbursement 
we are currently adding plastic recycling equipment in lowell  which is designed to increase our internal capability of processing scrap plastic 
in addition  we have completed the site work for the addition of a production facility on the property adjacent to our springdale plant  and construction on a second raw material system to service both plants has commenced and is intended to become operational starting in phases during the second quarter of the building program will provide the capacity necessary to achieve higher sales levels and sustain our growth 
our expansion plans currently are prioritized around increasing plastic recycling capacity and lowering raw material costs  in conjunction with further automating our production processes to improve efficiencies and increase margins 
new capital projects are funded primarily from cash flow  and there is no assurance as to when additional funds will be available or as to when the projects will be completed 
our capital improvement budget for is currently estimated at million  of which we believe we can finance million through long term debt and operating leases  the balance of required funds must come from cash flow 
there is no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow to meet our objectives 
if we are unable to complete our capital expansion program as planned  it will affect our ability to grow sales and profit margins in and future years 
under the bond agreement  aert covenants that it will maintain certain financial ratios 
if we fail to comply with the covenants  or to secure a waiver there from  the bond trustee would have the option of demanding immediate repayment of the bonds 
in such an event  it could be difficult for us to refinance the bonds  which would give the bond trustee the option to take us into bankruptcy 
we were not in compliance with two covenants as of december  the bond trustee has waived these covenants as of december  through  and including  december  we expect to be in compliance with all bond covenants by december  bonds payable and allstate notes payable debt covenants december  compliance long term debt service coverage ratio for last four quarters of at least to yes current ratio of not less than to as adjusted no waived debt to equity ratio of not more than to yes not more than of accounts payable in excess of days past invoice date no waived not more than of accounts receivable in excess of days past invoice date yes the current ratio calculation was modified to include the debt service reserve fund of  in current assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported on our financial statements 
the estimates made in applying the accounting policies described below are material to the financial statements and notes thereto due to the level of judgment involved in arriving at those estimates 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances 
delinquency fees are not assessed 
payments of accounts receivable are allocated to the specific invoices identified on the customers remittance advice 
accounts receivable are carried at the original invoice amount less an estimated reserve 
table of contents made for returns and discounts based on quarterly review of historical rates of returns and expected discounts to be taken 
the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced  if needed  by a valuation allowance that reflects management s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected 
management individually reviews all accounts receivable balances that exceed sixty days from invoice date and based on an assessment of current creditworthiness  estimates the portion  if any  of the balance that will not be collected 
management provides for probable uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation based on its assessment of the current status of the individual accounts 
balances that remain outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to trade accounts receivable 
changes in the valuation allowance have not been material to the financial statements 
recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received 
due to the nature of our business and our association with large national corporations  our collection of receivables has stayed at a constant level with very little uncollectible accounts 
buildings and equipment property additions and betterments include capitalized interest and acquisition  construction and administrative costs allocable to construction projects and property purchases 
provision for depreciation of buildings and equipment is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
gains or losses on sales or other dispositions of property are credited or charged to income in the period incurred 
repairs and maintenance costs are charged to income in the period incurred  unless it is determined that the useful life of the respective asset has been extended 
we account for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires an assessment of the recoverability of our investment in long lived assets to be held and used in operations whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
such assessment requires that the future cash flows associated with the long lived assets be estimated over their remaining useful lives and an impairment loss recognized when the future cash flows are less than the carrying value of such assets 
stock based compensation we have to date accounted for our stock option plans and other stock based compensation under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which allows us to use the intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations see note to the financial statements 
accordingly  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our common stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
under sab  revenue is recognized when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company typically recognizes revenue at the time of shipment 
sales are recorded net of discounts  rebates  and returns 
estimates of expected sales discounts are calculated by applying the appropriate sales discount rate to all unpaid invoices that are eligible for the discount 
the company s sales prices are determinable given that the company s sales discount rates are fixed and given the predictability with which customers take sales discounts 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations outstanding as of december  payments due by period less than to to more than total year years years years long term debt operating leases total our waste wood and scrap polyethylene supply contracts have varying terms and pricing structures 
the contracts generally obligate us to take whatever waste the supplier generates as long as the waste meets our standards 
pricing for these contracts can be renegotiated every six or twelve months  however  so determining our precise future liability is not possible 
uncertainties  issues and risks there are many factors that could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
these factors include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions  decline in demand  business or industry changes  critical accounting policies  government rules and regulations  environmental concerns  litigation  new products product transition  competition  acts of war  terrorism  public health issues  concentration of customer base  availability of raw material plastic at a reasonable price  management s failure to execute effectively  inability to obtain adequate financing ie working capital  equipment breakdowns  low stock price  and fluctuations in quarterly performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have no material exposures relating to our long term debt because all of our long term debt bears interest at fixed rates 
see note to the financial statements for a discussion of outstanding debt 
we depend on the market for favorable long term mortgage rates to help generate sales of our product for use in the residential construction industry 
should mortgage rates increase substantially  our business could be impacted by a reduction in the residential construction industry 
important raw materials that we purchase are recycled plastic and wood fiber  which are subject to price fluctuations 
we attempt to limit the impact of price increases on these materials by negotiating with each supplier on a term basis
