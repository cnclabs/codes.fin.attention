overview immunomedics  inc is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of monoclonal  antibody based products for the targeted treatment of cancer  autoimmune and other serious diseases 
we have developed a number of advanced proprietary technologies that allow us to create humanized antibodies that can be used either alone in unlabeled  or naked  form  or conjugated with radioactive isotopes  chemotherapeutics or toxins  in each case to create highly targeted agents 
using these technologies  we have built a broad pipeline of therapeutic product candidates that utilize several different mechanisms of action 
we believe that our portfolio of intellectual property  which includes approximately issued patents in the united states and approximately other issued patents worldwide  protects our product candidates and technologies 
in addition to our potential therapeutic products  our proprietary technologies have also enabled us to develop highly specific diagnostic imaging agents  one of which  leukoscan  has been approved in europe  canada and australia  where it is currently being marketed for the detection of bone infections 
consistent with our de emphasis of our diagnostic business in the near future  the company will no longer commercialize cea scan 
from inception in until june   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and have never earned a profit 
in the absence of increased revenues from the sale of current or future products and licensing activities the amount  timing  nature or source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we continue to conduct our research and development activities 
these activities are budgeted to expand over time and will require further resources if we are to be successful 
as a result  our operating losses are likely to be substantial over the next several years 
the development and commercialization of successful therapeutic products is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including  without limitation  the following the type of therapeutic compound under investigation and nature of the disease in connection with which the compound is being studied  our ability  as well as the ability of our partners  to conduct and complete clinical trials on a timely basis  the time required for us to comply with all applicable federal  state and foreign legal requirements  including  without limitation  our receipt of the necessary approvals of the us food and drug administration  the financial resources available to us during any particular period  and many other factors associated with the commercial development of therapeutic products outside of our control 
research and development as of june   we employed professionals in our research and development departments and professionals in our pre clinical and clinical research departments 
in addition to salaries and benefits  the other costs associated with research and development include the costs associated with producing biopharmaceutical compounds  laboratory equipment and supplies  the costs of conducting clinical trials  legal fees and expenses associated with pursuing patent protection  as well as facilities costs 
we have spent approximately million  million and million in the aggregate for the fiscal years ended june   and respectively on research and development expenses 
with the completion in fiscal year of the manufacturing expansion to support our research and development efforts and prepare for future commercialization of our product candidates  we believe that our facilities are adequate to support our research and development activities for the next few years without the need for any material capital expenditures 
at any one time our scientists are engaged in the research and development of multiple therapeutic compounds 
because we do not track expenses on the basis of each individual compound under investigation  but rather aggregate research and development costs for accounting purposes  it is not possible for investors to analyze and compare the expenses associated with unsuccessful research and development efforts for any particular fiscal period  with those associated with compounds that are determined to be worthy of further development 
this may make it more difficult for investors to evaluate our business and future prospects 
therapeutics we believe that each of our antibodies has therapeutic potential either when administered alone or when conjugated with therapeutic radioisotopes radiolabeled  chemotherapeutics or other toxins to create unique and potentially more effective treatment options 
the attachment of various compounds to antibodies is intended to allow the delivery of these therapeutic agents to tumor sites with greater precision than conventional radiation therapy or chemotherapeutic approaches 
this treatment method is designed to reduce the total exposure of the patient to the therapeutic agents  which ideally minimizes debilitating side effects 
we are currently focusing our efforts on unlabeled  or naked antibodies and antibodies conjugated with drugs or toxins  and to lesser extent on the use of radioisotopes  such as yttrium  sometimes referred to as y  and iodine  sometimes referred to as i epratuzumab our most advanced therapeutic product candidate  immu  is an unlabeled humanized antibody which targets an antigen  known as the cd marker  found on the surface of b lymphocytes  a type of white blood cells 
since b lymphocytes are involved in the production of autoantibodies  we reasoned that epratuzumab might show activity in the treatment of autoimmune diseases by affecting b cell levels and function 
our humanized cd antibody has been shown not to evoke any substantial anti epratuzumab antibodies in nhl patients  even after repeated dosing  making it a good candidate for treating patients with a chronic  non malignant disease 
in october  updated clinical results of epratuzumab in patients with sle were presented at the th annual scientific meeting of american college of rheumatology association of rheumatology health professionals 
the objective of this open label  single center study was to evaluate the safety  tolerability  lack of immunogenicity and early evidence of efficacy of epratuzumab  which was administered as a single agent every other week  for a total of four doses 
a scoring system called bilag british isle lupus assessment group was used to measure the level of disease activity in these patients prior to  and  at several time points  post administration of epratuzumab 
patients with mild to moderate sle activity defined by global bilag scores of prior to treatment were enrolled 
a high bilag score indicates increased disease activity 
sle assessments after treatment demonstrated consistent clinical improvement  with decreased global bilag scores for all fourteen enrolled patients compared to the pre therapy scores 
specifically  nine out of fourteen patients had lowered their global bilag scores by or more twenty four hours post therapy 
furthermore  six of the seven patients who had returned for their six month check up retained clinical benefit 
in all patients  the treatment was well tolerated with infusions completed in about one hour  and no evidence of reactions or immunogenicity 
based on these positive results  we submitted an application with the us food and drug administration fda for fast track designation and in january   received notice from the agency granting epratuzumab fast track product designation for the treatment of patients with moderate and severe sle 
the fast track programs of the fda are designed to facilitate drug development and to expedite the review of new drugs that are intended to treat serious or life threatening conditions  and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs 
as such  the fast track designation allows for close and frequent interaction with the agency 
a designated fast track drug may also be considered for priority review with a shortened review time  rolling submission  and accelerated approval if applicable 
in may   we initiated two pivotal phase iii clinical trials to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of epratuzumab for the treatment of patients with moderate and severe sle 
these pivotal trials are randomized  double blinded  placebo controlled  multi center studies using the bilag index to monitor and assess disease activity 
the trials have been named alleviate or alleviate lupus affliction with epratuzumab and validate its autoimmune safety and efficacy 
one trial  alleviate a  is for patients with severe sle flares  and the second trial  alleviate b  is for patients with moderately active sle 
we anticipate completing the initial phase of these trials in approximately two years 
sle is a serious autoimmune disease affecting approximately million americans  according to the lupus foundation of america 
in the us  women with sle outnumber men by a ratio of nine to one  and of female patients develop lupus between the ages of and at present  there is no cure for lupus and no new lupus drug has been approved in the us for nearly years 
lupus most often results in chronic inflammation and pain affecting various parts of the body  especially the skin  joints  blood  and kidneys 
the disease can be serious and life threatening 
current treatments used in medical practice include corticosteroids  nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  immunosuppressives  and antimalarials 
another autoimmune indication that we are targeting with epratuzumab is sj gren s syndrome  a disease that currently affects between to million americans 
we presented results from our open label  non randomized  two center phase i ii trial in june   at the european league against rheumatism eular annual european congress of rheumatology 
fifteen patients with primary sj gren s syndrome were enrolled in this study to assess feasibility  safety  and early evidence of efficacy 
over an eight week period  patients received mg m of epratuzumab every two weeks for a total of four doses 
fourteen patients received all four infusions without reactions with a median infusion time of fifty minutes 
one patient discontinued the third infusion due to an acute infusion reaction  but completed the fourth infusion with no further reaction 
patients reported improvements in their clinical signs and symptoms that include dry eyes  dry mouth  fatigue  tender joints  tender points  tear and salivary flow 
specifically  twenty four hours after the last treatment  symptomatic improvements ranging from of patients experiencing tender joints to of patients with salivary flow were observed 
moreover  when these patients were evaluated twelve weeks post therapy  of patients who showed tender joints improvement retained clinical benefit  as did of patients with increased salivary flow 
a final evaluation is planned for six months after the last epratuzumab dose 
epratuzumab seems to show activity without causing a drastic drop in the number of circulating b lymphocytes  thus perhaps reducing the risk of infection 
consistent with our past clinical experience with the antibody  we have found a reduction of to in circulating b cells in the patients enrolled in both the sle and sj gren s syndrome trials 
this data suggests that b cell modulation may be the primary mechanism of action of epratuzumab  and that complete depletion of b cells is not necessary to provide a clinical benefit 
immu has also demonstrated good safety  tolerability  and clinical efficacy in more than patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma  resulting in reports published in the journal of clinical oncology and clinical cancer research 
while the clinical results to date have been encouraging  we are not able to determine when  if ever  epratuzumab will be approved for sale in the united states or anywhere else 
even if it is approved  there can be no assurance that it will be commercially successful or that we will ever receive revenues equal to our financial investment in this product candidate 
other therapeutic product candidates we also have in development a solid tumor therapeutic product candidate that targets an antigen known as carcinoembryonic antigen  or cea 
the cea antigen is abundant at the site of virtually all cancers of the colon and rectum and is associated with many other solid tumors  such as breast and lung cancers 
a phase ii trial has been completed in europe for immu hcea i in patients with proven or suspected metastatic colorectal cancer who failed chemotherapy 
we believe that the initial results with immu are encouraging 
this phase i ii trial with immu hcea y has completed enrollment in the united states and in europe in patients with advanced colorectal and pancreatic cancers 
we are not currently conducting clinical trials with our cea antibody  however  we are providing clinical supplies for an investigator sponsored phase ii clinical trial in germany  evaluating repeat dosing with immu we also are commencing clinical trials with immu anti cd for the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases 
we are currently conducting clinical trials in patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma with immu  and we are conducting clinical trials with immu for use in targeting anti muc antibody for pancreatic cancer therapy 
in addition to these three product candidates  we have several others in pre clinical development 
diagnostics in  we began to transition our focus away from the development of diagnostic imaging products in order to accelerate the development of our therapeutic product candidates 
as a result  as of june   research and development into diagnostic imaging product candidates was no longer a material portion of our business 
ibc pharmaceuticals  inc in  we began conducting research involving the selective delivery of therapeutic agents to fight cancer as part of a collaboration with beckman coulter  inc beckman coulter 
upon our formation of the joint venture  ibc pharmaceuticals  llc  ibc llc  we granted certain intellectual property to the venture  as did beckman coulter 
we were then reimbursed for all of the research activities we conducted on the joint venture s behalf 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we were able to acquire all of the membership interests in ibc llc held by beckman coulter  giving us majority control of the business 
ibc llc was then reorganized into ibc pharmaceuticals  inc  a delaware corporation ibc 
we currently hold all of the outstanding shares of ibc series a preferred stock  representing approximately of the total shares of voting stock outstanding 
as a result of our majority interest in ibc  operating results of ibc are consolidated with the company 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting policies and judgments made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition contract revenue from collaborative research agreements is recorded when earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees and certain guaranteed payments where we continue involvement through collaborative development are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of continuing involvement 
we estimate the period of continuing involvement based on the best available evidential matter available to us at each reporting period 
if our estimated time frame for continuing involvement changes  this change in estimate could impact the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
revenue is recognized for royalties based on license sales of our product cea scan in japan and in europe 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the contractual terms when royalty from licenses can be reliably measured and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales is recorded when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowances  if any  are established for uncollectible amounts  estimated product returns and discounts 
since allowances are recorded based on management s estimates  actual amounts may be different in the future 
foreign currency risks since immunomedics operates in countries outside of the united states  it is exposed to various foreign currency risks that arise  from the nature of the contracts immunomedics executes with its customers  since  from time to time  contracts are denominated in a currency different than the particular immunomedics subsidiary s local currency 
these risks are generally applicable only to a portion of the contracts executed by the company s foreign subsidiaries providing clinical services 
the company is exposed to foreign currency risk resulting from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers and affiliates under these contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against such invoices 
because the contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  immunomedics recognizes a receivable at the time of invoicing for the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared and payment from the customer is received will result in immunomedics receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
this difference is recognized by immunomedics as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and is reported in other expense income in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  for intercompany transactions for which settlement is planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future  the related foreign currency transaction gains or losses  as applicable  are reported in other expenses income in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the company s consolidated financial results 
the process by which each foreign subsidiary s financial results are translated into us dollars is as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects the stockholders equity account  referred to as the cumulative translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiary s us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign balance sheet stated in us dollars in balance 
to date such cumulative translation adjustments have not been material to the company s consolidated financial position 
stock based compensation immunomedics grants stock options to its employees at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant and accounts for these stock option grants in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
under apb opinion no 
 when stock options are issued with an exercise price equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized in the income statement 
however  for purposes of disclosure only  we estimate the fair value of stock options through the use of option pricing models 
in determining the values to use in our option pricing model  we make several subjective estimates about the characteristics of the underlying stock and the expected timing of option exercise 
changes to these estimates can change the fair value disclosures in our financial statements 
the company s board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of all outstanding stock options as of june   primarily to avoid stock based compensation charges upon the adoption of sfas r on july  the exercise price of all stock options was above market value of the common stock at the time of the accelerated vesting 
impairment of assets immunomedics reviews its long lived assets for impairment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based upon the company s judgment of its ability to recover the asset from the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related operations 
actual future cash flows may be greater or less than estimated 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  in the fiscal year ended june   representing a decrease of  or  primarily due to lower product sales and a decrease in license fees 
product sales were  lower in europe primarily due to a lack of saleable leukoscan product  as current production is waiting for submission to the european regulatory authorities 
license fee and other revenues for fiscal year decreased to  from  for the same period in  primarily due to the complete recognition of revenues associated with the development and license agreement with amgen  inc amgen agreement which declined from  in to in total operating expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  in fiscal year  representing an increase of  or 
research and development expenses for fiscal year increased by  from  in fiscal year to  primarily due to the beginning of the phase iii trials for epratuzumab for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus sle  as well as increased research and development efforts including outside toxicity testing associated with producing compounds to be used in clinical trials 
cost of goods sold for fiscal year decreased by  to  from  in fiscal year  primarily due to lower sales of in vitro diagnostic kits and other imaging products 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  for fiscal year  representing a decrease of  the decline in marketing expenses was due to de emphasis of diagnostic product line 
general and administrative costs for fiscal year increased by  from  in fiscal year to  this increase was primarily due to settlement of corporate litigation in and a  insurance claim for product contamination that was received in and not repeated in interest and other income for fiscal year decreased by  from  in fiscal year to  in  primarily due to reduced level of cash available for investment during the year 
interest expense increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year this increase resulted primarily from the  of senior convertible notes sold in april also included in interest expense in is the amortization expense associated with the debt issuance costs  and the debt discount 
in september a patent infringement suit with cytogen  inc and cr bard was settled for an undisclosed amount without any admission of fault or liability 
in connection with the settlement  the company settled legal fees associated with the suit with the attorneys representing it in the case 
the company recorded a litigation settlement gain in other income in the amount of  which includes the reversal of legal fees previously accrued for this patent suit 
the specific amount of the settlement  however  is undisclosed in accordance with the terms of the parties settlement agreement 
at june  the liabilities outstanding related to the warrants from the senior convertible notes were revalued based on the company s common stock price 
the valuation of the liability for these warrants was adjusted as of june  due to the decline in the company s common stock from per share on april  to per share 
as such  the gain from the change in fair value of the warrant liability of  was recorded in the statement of operations 
for fiscal years and  we recorded a tax benefit of  and  respectively  as a result of our sale of approximately  and  of new jersey state net operating losses  respectively 
these tax benefits were partially offset by income tax provisions of  and  primarily from our european subsidiary for and  respectively 
net loss allocable to common stockholders for fiscal year is  or per share  as compared to  or per share  in fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  in the fiscal year ended june   representing a decrease of  or  primarily due to a decrease in license fees 
license fee and other revenues for fiscal year decreased to  from  for the same period in  primarily due to the complete recognition of the licensing fees associated with the development and license agreement with amgen  inc amgen agreement by february revenues derived from the amgen agreement declined from  in to  in product sales for fiscal year were about the same as as a result of the company s decision to transition its focus from the sale of diagnostic imaging products to the development of therapeutic compounds 
revenues from grants for research and development for fiscal year increased to  from  for the same period of total operating expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  in fiscal year  representing an increase of  or 
research and development expenses for fiscal year increased by  from  in fiscal year to  primarily due to an increased number of professional staff  as well as increased research and development efforts including manufacturing expenses such as laboratory supplies associated with producing compounds to be used in clinical trials 
cost of goods sold for fiscal year increased by  to  from  in fiscal year  primarily due to increased sales of in vitro diagnostic kits and other imaging products and establishment of reserves for inventory on hand for product lines that are being de emphasized 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  for fiscal year  representing a decrease of  general and administrative costs for fiscal year decreased by  from  in fiscal year to  interest and other income for fiscal year decreased by  from  in fiscal year to  in  primarily due to lower rates of return on our invested cash and reduced level of cash available for investment 
interest expense increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year this increase was due to the  bond financing with the new jersey economic authority  completed in may  and the issuance of  of senior convertible notes  which was completed in january for fiscal years and  we recorded a tax benefit of  and  respectively  as a result of our sale of approximately  and  of new jersey state net operating losses  respectively 
these tax benefits were partially offset by income tax provisions of  and  primarily from our european subsidiary for and  respectively 
net loss allocable to common stockholders for fiscal year is  or per share  as compared to  or per share  in fiscal year research and development expenses research and development expenses for our products in development were   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased by  in or as compared to research and development expenses increased by  or as compared to historically the company does not track expenses on the basis of each individual compound under investigation or through clinical trials and therefore we do not provide a breakdown of such historical information in that format 
the company evaluates projects under development from an operational perspective  including such factors as results of individual compounds from laboratory animal testing  patient results and enrollment statistics in clinical trials 
it is important to note that multiple product candidates are often tested simultaneously 
it is not possible to calculate each antibody s supply costs 
there are many different development processes and test methods that examine multiple products at the same time 
we have  historically  tracked our costs in the categories discussed below  specifically research costs and product development costs and by the types of costs outlined below 
our research costs consists of outside costs associated with animal studies and costs associated with research and testing of our product candidates prior to reaching the clinical stage 
such research costs primarily include personnel costs  facilities  including depreciation  lab supplies  funding of outside contracted research and license fees 
our product development costs consist of costs from preclinical development including manufacturing  conducting and administering clinical trials and patent expenses 
the following table sets forth a breakdown of our research and development expenses by those associated with research and those associated with product development for the periods indicated 
years ended june  research costs product development costs total research costs research costs in total increased by  or as compared to research costs increased by  in or as compared to the increases in research costs primarily relate to the following animal studies conducted by outside organizations in were  an increase of  or over  as testing for toxicity studies for compounds in the preclinical stage of development 
the increase in over was  or a increase  relating to the increased level of toxicity studies performed by outside organizations 
personnel costs in were  a decrease of  or as compared to this slight decline resulted from employee attrition and the increased focus to product development as compounds proceeded further in clinical trials 
for the fiscal year personnel costs increased by  or over due to increases in personnel levels 
facility costs in were  a decrease of  or as compared to  as a result of a reduction in depreciation expense as assets acquired in previous years became fully depreciated 
facility costs increased  in over levels  or 
this increase resulted primarily from higher utilities and related expenses associated from the expansion in our facility in product development costs product development costs in total increased by  or as compared to product development costs increased by  in or as compared to the increases in product development costs primarily relate to the following personnel costs in were  an increase of  or as compared to this small increase was primarily attributed to salary increases offset by employee attrition and cost control efforts in the manufacturing and clinical monitoring areas 
for the fiscal year personnel costs increased by  or over due to staffing increases brought on by the increased product development efforts 
clinical trial expenses in were  an increase of  or over this increase is primarily the result of the beginning of the phase iii clinical trials for epratuzumab for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus sle  which incurred approximately  of expenses in clinical trial expenses for were  or lower than in  due primarily to the timing of patient enrollment for clinical trials taking place 
patent expenses for were  as increase of  or over for the fiscal year patent expenses were  lower or below the increase for patent expenses in is primarily attributed to increased applications of patents in foreign locations and vigorous defense of existing patents 
facility costs in were  an increase of  or over facility costs in reflect an increase of  or over the increases in facility costs primarily relates to increased investment in our manufacturing facility and equipment that took place during the fiscal year 
as a result depreciation  utilities  maintenance and related expenses have increased 
lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were  in  an increase of  or over these expenses were  in  an increase of  or over these increases resulted from the increased production levels of the new manufacturing facility and growth needed for clinical trial demands 
we expect product development costs to increase in the future due to the phase iii clinical trials for sle and as other products are developed 
if we are not successful in obtaining additional financing over the coming year  it will be necessary to implement cost reductions in research and other areas 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more 
the length of time varies according to the type  complexity and the disease indication of the product candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following periods clinical phase estimated completion period phase i years phase ii years phase iii years the duration and cost of clinical trials through each of the clinical trial phases may vary significantly over the life of a particular project as a result of  among other things  the following factors the length of time required to recruit qualified patients for clinical trials the duration of patient follow up in light of trials results the number of clinical sites required for trials and the number of patients that ultimately participate liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of our equity securities  revenue earned under licensing agreements and  to a lesser degree  from sales of cea scan and leukoscan  research grants from various sources and investment income 
at june   we had working capital of  representing an increase of  from  at june  the increase in working capital is a result of the april senior convertible debt  and sale of common stock through a private placement in august  partially offset by the company s loss on operations of  the increase of current liabilities as of june  was primarily due to  of accruals relating to our phase iii clinical trials for sle  which were settled during the first quarter of at june   we had long term debt  net of discounts  of  senior convertible notes due  and the new jersey economic development authority 
the april  private placement of the senior convertible notes raised total gross proceeds of  a portion of the proceeds received from the offering of the notes was used for payment of related fees and expenses and to retire million principal amount of the senior convertible notes due in january the resulting net cash proceeds raised from this transaction was  in addition   of the senior convertible notes was exchanged for  of the senior convertible notes 
the senior convertible notes mature three years from their date of issuance  are convertible into company common stock at a conversion rate of per share and bear interest at the rate of per annum 
if a note is converted or cancelled prior to maturity  the holder will be paid on the date of conversion or cancellation any interest that would have otherwise been earned during the three year term 
for each  principal amount of notes purchase  purchasers were granted a warrant to purchase approximately shares of common stock 
the warrants expire three years from the initial closing date and will be exercisable at per share 
in august  the company sold  shares of its common stock  resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
the shares were sold to institutional investors at a price of per share 
the shares of common stock were sold pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities amounted to  at june   representing an increase of  from  at june  the increase was primarily attributable to the august common stock private placement and the april sale of senior convertible notes  offset by the company s net loss for these proceeds will be used for research and development activities and funding of operating expenses 
it is anticipated that working capital  and cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be utilized during fiscal year as a result of planned research and development  other operating expenses and capital expenditures  partially offset by projected revenues from sales of our diagnostic imaging products 
however  there can be no assurance as to the amount of revenues  if any  these imaging products will provide 
we expect to utilize our cash equivalents and short term investments to fund our operations for the fiscal year  which is expected to be at a higher level than in the fiscal year due to increased spending for clinical trials 
however  we do not believe we will have adequate cash at this expected spending level to fund our research and development programs through the next twelve months 
we will require additional funding after we utilize our current liquid assets in order to continue our research and development programs as is currently budgeted for fiscal year we are actively pursuing various financing alternatives as market conditions permit through additional debt or equity financings and through collaborative marketing and distribution agreements 
we continue to evaluate various programs to raise additional capital and to seek additional revenues from the licensing of our proprietary technologies 
at the present time  we are unable to determine whether any of these future activities will be successful and  if so  the terms and timing of any definitive agreements 
if we are unable to raise additional funding in the near term  we will curtail certain programs and implement cost savings programs in order to continue our operations at least through the fiscal year 
as of june  there was  of proceeds from the april senior convertible notes that was held in escrow in money market funds 
these funds became available for use by the company in the first quarter of actual results could differ materially from our expectations as a result of a number of risks and uncertainties  including the risks described in item  factors that may affect our business and results of operations  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our working capital and working capital requirements are affected by numerous factors and such factors may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
principal among these are the success of product commercialization and marketing products  the technological advantages and pricing of our products  the impact of the regulatory requirements applicable to us and access to capital markets that can provide us with the resources when necessary to fund our strategic priorities 
contractual commitments our major contractual obligations relate to an operating lease for our facility  a loan from the new jersey economic development authority used to fund the expansion of our facility  a contract to administer our phase iii sle clinical trials  the issuance of senior convertible notes and employment contracts in effect for the company s chairman of the board and the president chief executive officer 
we have identified and quantified the significant commitments in the following table for the fiscal years ending june in thousands contractual obligation payments due by period thereafter total operating lease njeda loan long term contract senior convertible notes employment contracts total in november  we renewed our operating lease for our morris plains  new jersey facility for an additional term of years expiring in october at a base annual rate of  which included an additional  square feet 
the rent is fixed for the first five years and increases every five years thereafter 
in may  we obtained a loan for  at a variable interest rate through the new jersey economic development authority  repayable monthly in equal installments 
on june   we entered into an agreement with ppd development lp to operate on the company s contract research organization to manage the phase iii clinical trials for sle
