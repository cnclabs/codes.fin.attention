item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are engaged in the design  manufacture  distribution and sale of women s and children s apparel  and vinyl  leather and fabric handbags  sport bags  backpacks  cosmetic bags  and related products 
our apparel lines include women s loungewear  sleepwear  dresses and sportswear  and lingerie  as well as infants and children s clothing 
our products are mostly made to order  and we market and sell our products to a range of retailers  including general merchandise stores  retail chain stores  department stores  cosmetic companies  major mail order catalogs and other specialty retailers 
our business is subject to seasonal variations 
historically  we have realized a significant portion of net sales during the first and second fiscal quarters  during which time our customers generally increase inventory levels in anticipation of both back to school and holiday sales 
that trend has continued during fiscal we believe this seasonality is consistent with the general pattern associated with sales to the retail industry and we expect this pattern to continue 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of other factors  including the timing of shipments to customers and general economic conditions 
accordingly  comparisons between quarters may not necessarily be meaningful  and the results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly results or of full year performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from its estimates 
such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required by the policies  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies that are described below 
merchandise inventory 
our merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  and we also maintain accounts receivable insurance on certain of our customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
market development accruals 
we estimate reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
we review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis based on current experience  trends and our customers performance 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill annually or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
in making this assessment  we rely on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic considerations  anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 
a change in these underlying assumptions may cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying value 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge which would impact earnings 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences in the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as measured by enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the periods when the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
significant judgement is required in determining the provisions for income taxes 
we establish the provisions based upon management s assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences  tax credits and interest expense applied to temporary difference adjustments 
the tax provisions are analyzed periodically at least annually and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments to those provisions 
discount rate 
the discount rate that the company utilizes for determining future pension obligations is based on the moody s aa corporate bond index 
the indices selected reflect the weighted average remaining period of benefit payments 
the discount rate had decreased to as of june  from as of june  a further basis point change in the discount rate would generate an experience gain or loss of approximately  liquidity and capital resources the net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the fiscal year ended june  of  was the result of funds provided by financing activities totaling  offset by funds used in investing activities of  and by funds used in operating activities totaling  net cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities of  mostly attributable to lower inventory levels and an increase in accounts receivable totaling  due to higher may and june net sales in fiscal compared to the same two month period in fiscal  not fully offset by net earnings of  and a decrease in inventory levels totaling  reflecting both higher fourth quarter sales in fiscal compared to the prior comparable period as well as lower projected first quarter net sales for fiscal versus first quarter net sales

results of operations compared to net sales for fiscal totaled  an increase of  or  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase reflected significantly higher handbag net sales  not fully offset by lower apparel net sales 
sales by category were as follows net sales for the apparel category in fiscal were  a decrease of  or from the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in net sales was primarily due to the elimination of several private label programs from one of the women s sleepwear division s customers  and a reduction in net sales in our catalogue business due to the loss of one of that business significant customers who will be sourcing goods directly 
net sales for the handbags category in fiscal were  or higher than the prior fiscal year s total of  the sales increase is mostly attributable to increased sales for the premium business reflecting continued growth with its most significant customer  and somewhat higher net sales in our other handbag division 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in the decrease in gross margins is mostly a function of much lower handbag margins this fiscal year 
gross margins by category were as follows gross margin for the apparel category in decreased to compared to in this percentage point decrease was primarily attributable to much lower gross margins in the children s apparel business  due to required higher customer allowances in the current fiscal year versus fiscal  not fully offset by higher women s sleepwear business gross margins 
gross margin for the handbags category in decreased to compared to 
this decrease was mainly due to much lower competitive margins in our premium business 
the much lower gross margin in the premium business  for the most part  reflects marketplace competition resulting in the company reducing its gross profit margin in order to maintain sales 
in addition  we experienced lower handbag business margins due to reduced sales of licensed products which normally carry a higher margin  in the current fiscal year compared to fiscal shipping  selling and administrative expenses decreased by  in fiscal to  as a percentage of net sales  shipping  selling and administrative expenses declined to from in fiscal the principal factors attributable to the decrease are lower selling expenses a decrease of approximately  reflecting lower selling commissions attributable to sales mix  lower royalty expense relating to the reduced sale of licensed products approximately  and lower general and administrative expense in fiscal about  mostly due to the approximately  fiscal charge for the union pension withdrawal liability  offset somewhat by higher product development expense about  in fiscal for the children s apparel business associated with anticipated higher volume in fiscal interest expense was  an increase of  from the last fiscal year  primarily the result of higher interest rates in the current fiscal year compared to fiscal net earnings of  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
this year s lower net earnings were primarily due to lower gross margin dollars and higher interest costs  not fully offset by lower shipping  selling and administrative expenses  as discussed above  as well as a lower effective tax rate in the current fiscal year primarily attributable to the recovery of a valuation allowance associated with foreign tax credits  compared to fiscal compared to net sales for fiscal totaled  an increase of  or  compared to the prior fiscal year 
sales by category were as follows net sales for the apparel category in fiscal were  an increase of  or  compared to fiscal the sales increase for this category was primarily due to an  increase in net sales from the women s sleepwear business  which resulted mostly from increased orders from one customer based on prior season sell through of both private label and licensed product 
this significant increase was offset  in part  by an almost  decrease in the catalog business reflecting continued lower demand for mail order apparel 
the remainder of the offset is attributable to lower children s apparel sales reflecting a lower level of reorders from one of our customers 
net sales for the handbags category were  for the year ended june   an increase of  or about above the same period in the prior year  reflecting a  increase in the premium business the result of increased orders by one of its significant customers  offset by a  decrease in our handbag business  where licensed products were in less demand 
overall gross margins were in compared to in the prior fiscal year 
gross margins by category were as follows gross margin for the apparel category in improved to from in the prior fiscal year 
the percentage point increase was primarily attributable to higher margins contributed by the children s apparel business due to a favorable product mix  offset by lower margins in the women s sleepwear business attributable to increased cotton and other raw material prices in the far east  as well as an increase in the level of shipments to discounters during this period 
gross margin for the handbags category decreased to in compared to in the similar prior year 
a lower gross margin in the handbag business  for the most part  reflects marketplace competition on several programs causing this division to reduce its gross profit margin to an acceptable level in order to maintain sales 
the overall decrease was not completely offset by slightly higher gross profit margins in the premium business 
shipping  selling and administrative expenses increased by  in fiscal to  of net sales 
the prior fiscal year totaled  of net sales 
the increase was mainly due to volume mix related expenses in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
a significant part of the increase related to higher selling commissions as a result of changes in sales mix an increase of  product development an increase of  higher royalty expense an increase of  relating to additional licensed product sales  an increase relating to a charge for a union pension withdrawal liability an increase of  and higher business and employee health care insurance premiums totaling approximately  reference is made to note i  employees benefit plans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page f of this form k for additional information about the increase in the reserve for the union pension withdrawal liability 
interest expense was  an increase of  from the last fiscal year  reflecting an increased level of borrowing needed to finance the increased volume of business in the current fiscal year compared to fiscal the slight increase was offset somewhat by an approximately one half percent lower average interest rate in fiscal compared with the prior year 
net earnings of  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to net earnings of  in the prior year 
this year s higher net earnings were primarily due to higher net sales and gross margins  not completely offset by higher shipping  selling and administrative expenses  and higher interest expense  as discussed above 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is an amendment to fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values  and would be effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after june  we do not expect that the impact of sfas no 
r will be material to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to interest rate change market risk 
since our borrowing patterns are cyclical  we are not dependent on borrowing throughout the year 
nevertheless  a sudden increase in interest rates which under our bank line of credit is at the prime rate or at libor plus basis points may  especially during peak borrowing  potentially have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 
we estimate that a basis point fluctuation in applicable market interest rates would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately  based on fiscal borrowing levels 
we have not used  and currently do not anticipate using  any derivative financial instruments 
in addition  we have not been materially impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as substantially all of our business is transacted in  and is expected to continue to be transacted in  us dollar based currencies
