item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes and tables included in part ii  item of this form k 
management s discussion and analysis may contain forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance 
however  this performance involves risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
some of the important factors that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ from those discussed are listed under forward looking statements 
results of operations through our subsidiaries  we operate in three reportable segments friction products  precision components and performance racing 
our results of operations are affected by a variety of factors  including but not limited to  general economic conditions  customer demand for our products  competition  raw material pricing and availability  labor relations with our personnel and political conditions in the countries in which we operate 
we sell a wide range of products that have a corresponding range of gross margins 
our consolidated gross margin is affected by product mix  selling prices  material and labor costs as well as our ability to absorb overhead costs resulting from fluctuations in demand for our products 
in the fourth quarter of  we committed to a plan to sell our motor segment  which had operations in alton  illinois and monterrey  mexico 
this segment  which manufactures die cast aluminum rotors for fractional and sub fractional horsepower electric motors  failed to achieve a certain level of profitability  and  after completing an extensive analysis  we determined that a divestiture of this segment would allow us to concentrate on our core segments of friction products and precision components 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold certain fixed assets of our alton  illinois facility  which had been previously adjusted to their fair market value as of december  in addition  we recognized a fair market value adjustment loss of million million  net of tax on the sale of the land and building of this facility  which was included in the results of discontinued operations 
we continue to actively market the sale of the monterrey  mexico facility and anticipate selling the remaining portion of the business during we restated our results of operations for this segment to reclassify its net operations  assets and liabilities as discontinued for all periods presented in this report and these results are not included in this discussion of our results of operations 
also in the fourth quarter of  we committed to a restructuring program to achieve cost savings in our friction products segment by moving operations at our brook park  ohio location to a new production facility in catoosa  oklahoma 
we recently completed construction of our new manufacturing facility 
manufacturing began in late in that facility and will ramp up throughout when fully operational  we expect annual savings of approximately million from the facility 
in connection with the planned closure of the ohio facility  we reported pre tax restructuring costs of million in related to the relocation and employee severance expenses 
in addition  we recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter of related to the curtailment and contractual termination benefit costs of a defined benefit pension plan covering certain union employees of the ohio facility 
we expect to incur additional pre tax restructuring charges of approximately million to million in to complete this project 
in  our income from operations increased million to million  or  from the prior year 
this increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased sales volumes at all of our segments and continued implementation of lean manufacturing and cost reduction programs throughout the organization 
the improvement in operating income resulted despite price increases in our primary raw materials  change in product mix  increased labor and incentive compensation costs and restructuring costs related to the move to oklahoma 
although we have successfully passed on surcharges and price increases to our customers  a lag in that process negatively impacted our results in by approximately million 

table of contents outlook for based on our current view of the markets we serve  and new business awarded by customers during  we believe that our net sales will increase between and compared to levels 
we also expect to incur additional pre tax restructuring charges of approximately million to million in to complete the move of our operations at our brook park  ohio location to a new production facility in catoosa  oklahoma 
after giving affect to the charges related to the relocation of the new manufacturing facility  we expect income from operations to increase by to for the full year when compared to critical accounting policies hawk s critical accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgments underlying them are more fully described in note significant accounting policies of the notes to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this form k 
some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by us in the preparation of our financial statements 
in applying these policies  we use our best judgment to determine the underlying assumptions that are used in calculating the estimates that affect the reported values on our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
hawk reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we consider relevant 
if these estimates differ materially from actual results  the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 
however  historically our estimates have not been materially different from actual results 
hawk s critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our policy regarding the collectibility of accounts receivable is based on a number of factors 
in circumstances where a specific customer is unable to pay its obligations  we record a specific allowance for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount that we reasonably expect to collect 
if circumstances change  estimates of the recoverability of the amounts due us could change 
inventory reserves 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are developed based on historical experience and product demand 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our inventory reserves and make adjustments to the reserves as required 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of companies we acquired over the fair value of their net assets as of the date of acquisition 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  our policy is to evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually  or more frequently if there is a significant adverse event or change in the environment in which one of our business unit operates 
an impairment loss would be recorded in the period such determination is made 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
estimates of future discounted cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on our experience and knowledge of operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation and competitive trends 
if actual results are materially different than the assumptions used  impairment could result 
we performed the annual impairment test as of october  and and concluded that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
see note significant accounting policies to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this form k 

table of contents long lived assets 
long lived assets excluding goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
estimates of future undiscounted cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on our experience and knowledge of operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation and competitive trends 
if our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
based on our review  we recorded a pre tax  non cash impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of to our motor segment 
this segment is reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in this report 
other than as noted above  there were no impairment charges recorded in  or see note discontinued operations to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this form k 
pension benefits 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the most significant element in determining our pension income expense in accordance with sfas is the expected return on plan assets 
we assumed that the expected weighted average long term rate of return on plan assets will be for which is consistent with the rate used for based on our existing and forecasted asset allocation and related long term investment performance results  we believe that our assumption of future returns is reasonable 
however  should the rate of return differ materially from our assumed rate we could experience a material adverse effect on the funded status of our plans and our future pension expense 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income expense 
our cumulative unrecognized net actuarial loss on pension assets as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
we determine the discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities at their measurement date  december the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
at december   we determined this rate to be 
changes in discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected pension income expense  and the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  has been deferred as permitted by sfas we expect pension expense to be approximately million in this compares to million in and million including pension curtailment and contractual termination benefit costs of million in we expect cash contributions to our pension plans to be million in this compares to contributions of million in and million in income taxes 
our effective tax rate  taxes payable and other tax assets and liabilities reflect the current tax rates in the domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for reporting and income tax purposes 
as of december  and  we had net us federal operating loss carryforwards nol of million and million  respectively  and alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
sfas no  accounting for income taxes  sfas provides certain guidelines to follow in making the determination of the need for a valuation allowance 
we must show that taxable income is expected to be available for future periods sufficient to realize the benefits of temporary differences and carryforwards to not record an allowance 
we have identified strategies which  if implemented  would 
table of contents enable us to realize the aforementioned tax benefits  and therefore  we have determined that no valuation allowance is required as of december  foreign currency translation and transactions 
assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated using year end exchange rates  and revenues and expenses are translated using exchange rates as determined throughout the year 
gains or losses resulting from translation are included in a separate component of our shareholder s equity 
as of december  we recorded a translation gain through shareholders equity of million 
this gain was attributable to the strength of the euro throughout in  we reported a translation gain of million 
gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are translated to local currency at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
accounts receivable or payable in foreign currencies  other than the subsidiary s local currency  are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction 
the effect of the transaction s gain or loss is included in other income expense  net in our consolidated statement of operations 
foreign currency transaction losses were million in both and year ended december  compared to year ended december  our continuing operations are organized into three strategic segments 
these segments include friction products  precision components and performance racing 
in the fourth quarter of we committed to selling our motor segment 
as a result  we have classified this business as discontinued 
net sales 
our consolidated net sales in were million  an increase of million or from the same period in we experienced sales increases in all of our segments  primarily a result of the continuing economic recovery during in the industrial markets we serve  new product introductions and market share gains during the year

precision components 
net sales in our precision components segment were million in  an increase of compared to the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to continued improving conditions in the general industrial segments of the domestic economy served by this segment 
we experienced sales increases in the fluid power  automotive  appliance  truck and power tool markets served by this segment 
these increases were partially offset by a slight decline in the lawn and garden market during the year due primarily to an engineering change that eliminated a product previously supplied by us 
our precision component segment began production and sale of product from its new powder metal production facility in china during the fourth quarter of performance racing 
net sales in our performance racing segment were million  an increase of compared to net sales of million in the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the introduction of new clutch and transmission products during the year

income from operations increased million or to million in from million in income from operations as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in the increase was primarily the result of increased sales volumes which provided a higher absorption of fixed manufacturing costs  and continued cost reduction programs throughout the organization 
this increase was partially offset by surcharges and price increases on our raw materials  changes in product mix  increased labor and incentive compensation costs and increased friction aftermarket sales and marketing costs 
as a result of the items discussed above  income from operations at each of our segments was as follows income from operations by segment increase increase dollars in millions friction products precision components performance racing consolidated interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest rates on our variable rate debt partially offset by higher average borrowings during the year

we believe that cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under our bank facility will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditures  debt requirements and to finance our internal growth needs and restructuring initiatives for the next twelve months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with market risk  we manage our exposures to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through our regular operating and financial activities  which include the use of derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
at december   approximately  or million  of our total indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate 
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from floating rate debt on our bank facility 
if interest rates were to increase basis points from december  rates  and assuming no changes in debt from december  levels  there would be no material additional annual interest expense reported by us 
the interest rates on our long term debt reflect market rates and therefore  the carrying value of long term debt approximates fair value 
an analysis of our obligations is further discussed in note financing arrangements and note lease obligations in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this form k 
the following table presents our total contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  total thereafter contractual obligations short term debt bank facility senior notes capital lease and other debt obligations operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations other commercial commitments stand by letters of credit variable rate obligations the senior notes due november   accrue interest at a fixed rate of per annum or million per year 
purchase obligations primarily represent commitments for inventory purchases  services and capital expenditures under purchase order 

table of contents this contractual obligation table does not include our defined benefit pension obligations 
an analysis of our obligations under our defined benefit plans is contained in note employee benefits in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this form k 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the majority of our receipts and expenditures are contracted in us dollars  and we do not consider the market risk exposure relating to currency exchange to be material at this time 
in the aggregate  our portfolio of forward contracts as of december  related to foreign currency hedge contracts was not material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows during we have operations outside the united states with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily denominated in euros  canadian dollars  and chinese renminbi 
because we have foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  financial exposure may result  primarily from the timing of transactions and the movement of exchange rates 
we do not expect that our unhedged foreign currency balance sheet exposure as of december  will result in a significant impact on our earnings or cash flows 
we also monitor exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each country in which hawk operates  and periodically enter into forward contracts to mitigate that exposure 
as of december   we have no material derivative instruments outstanding
