results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
discontinued operations 
during the first quarter of  we transitioned from the business of developing and selling interactive television  or itv  technology  products and services for use in conjunction with cable tv broadband networks the itv business to the development of our video phone products as our primary business focus 
during the twelve months ended december  and  the company had revenues from discontinued operations of  and  respectively 
cost of revenues for the twelve months ended december  and were  and  respectively 
concurrently  operating expenses  consisting of research and development  marketing  general and administration  and depreciation and amortization costs were also reduced as a result of the transition from the itv business 
these expenses for discontinued operations were  and for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
for the twelve months ended december  and  other income and other expense relating to discontinued operations were  and  respectively 
included in were of losses incurred on the sale of certain property and equipment  and  from the sale of intellectual property and other assets to tv gateway llc refer to footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  the collectibility is reasonably assured  and either the delivery and the acceptance of the equipment has occurred or services have been rendered 
inventories 
our inventory consists primarily of finished goods equipment to be sold to our customers 
the cost is determined on an average cost basis 
a periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories 
factors related to current inventories such as technological obsolescence and market conditions are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values 
any significant unanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have an impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
with the current shift in focus to our new video phone business  our inventory balance of  consisted of  relating solely to our itv business  which was fully reserved for at december   and related solely to our new video phone business 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist of property and equipment 
these long lived assets are recorded at cost and are depreciated or amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
fair market value is determined by using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
measurement of the impairment  if any  will be based upon the difference between carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
if useful life estimates or anticipated cash flows change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish valuation allowances 
to the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
we have a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset of  as of december   due to our lack of earnings history and the uncertainty as to the reliability of the asset 
in the future  if sufficient evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income becomes apparent  we would be required to reduce our valuation allowance  resulting in a benefit from income tax in the consolidated statement of operations 
accounting for contractual obligation related to equity financing 
in july  four cable operators purchased our shares 
as part of the financing arrangement  we agreed to provide the four cable operators with a credit to be used to purchase products that pertain to the development and deployment of our service equal to of the amount they invested 
we recorded a liability to satisfy this obligation based on our best estimate of what it would cost to satisfy the credit 
our policy has been not to adjust the liability after it had been established 
when equipment credits are utilized by the cable operators  the value of the equipment is reflected in its entirety in the cost of revenues and a portion of the recorded contractual obligation is adjusted against additional paid in capital 
the equipment credit expired on august  in august  the unused credit balance of  was reclassified from the recorded liability to additional paid in capital 
stock based compensation 
the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and has presented the required sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
at december   the company had stock based compensation plans  which are described separately in note the company applies accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for its plans  and accordingly  no compensation cost has been recognized for the company s fixed stock based compensation 
accounting for preferred shares 
the company accounts for preferred stock in accordance with eitf topic d classification and measurement of redeemable securities  the redeemable preferred stock was recorded in the financial statements as temporary equity 
additionally  the fair value of warrants and preferred stock conversion options were recorded into the financial statements as liabilities as a result of their features that require accounting under fas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
at each reporting balance sheet date  an evaluation is made of these valuations and marked to market

non cash change in fair value of warrants and conversion options 
for the twelve months ended december   the non cash change in fair value of warrants and conversion option was an expense of  this expense was the result of a marked to market adjustment as of december  related to our june  private placement of our series a convertible preferred stock and warrants 
over the life of the instruments  these marked to market adjustment of gains and losses will offset and net to income taxes 
we have incurred net operating losses since inception and accordingly have had no income taxes and have not recorded any income tax benefit for those losses 
versus since our formation in and into january  our company had been in the business of developing and selling interactive television itv technology  products and services for use in conjunction with cable tv broadband networks the itv business 
using our solutions  cable tv operators branded  marketed  and offered a wide variety of itv packages to consumers 
these packages included walled gardens of information  communications solutions complete with internet based e mail and chat  and web surfing  all presented and engaged on the tv set 
during the third quarter of  we completed a sale of certain assets  including our itv intellectual property rights and our membership interest in tvgateway  llc  for million in cash to tvgateway  llc  a company we were instrumental in forming 
our transaction with tvgateway  llc marked a shift in our business away from the itv business and toward a new video phone product and associated business 
although we continued to support our current itv business during the first quarter of  our new video phone product became our primary product focus 
we advised our itv customers of our de emphasis of itv going forward 
we informed them that we were willing to continue our efforts into as long as we could do so on a profitable basis 
in january  with all our customers having taken steps to terminate their itv service in their markets  we decided to formally end our itv business and began to account for our itv business as a discontinued operation 
the funds we received from the sale of assets to tvgateway  llc  as well as the funds we received as a result of private placements of our securities on december  and december   have permitted us to fund the development of our new video phone business and our continuing operations in revenues revenues 
for the years ended december  and december  our revenues from continuing operations were revenues from discontinued operations for the year were primarily the result of first quarter products sales and consulting fees to tvgateway  llc  a then unconsolidated entity  subscriber fees from cable operators providing our interactive television products and services  and certain excess inventory and equipment sold during the year 
revenues for the twelve months ended december  related to the discontinued operations were  compared to  for the same period in this revenue decrease of  from to is primarily attributable to reduced consulting fees with tvgateway 
for the twelve months ended december   tvgateway consulting fees were  compared to  for the twelve months ended december  during the fourth quarter of  we also sold approximately of excess inventory at auction that was related to the discontinued operations 
costs and expenses cost of revenues 
cost of revenues from continuing operations were for the twelve months ended december  and cost of revenues for the year related to discontinued operations consisted of primarily equipment product costs related to commercial deployments  the sale of excess inventory and equipment  and service fee revenue costs related primarily to the provision of engineering and administrative services 
such discontinued operations costs of equipment product revenues for the twelve months ended december  were  or approximately of equipment product revenues  compared to the discontinued operations product costs of revenues of  or approximately of equipment product revenues  for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in the cost of equipment product revenues as a percent of total equipment product revenues for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the twelve months ended december   was primarily the result of increased level of equipment revenues  partially offset by an increase in inventory provisions recorded against the carrying amount of inventory products to adjust them to their net realizable value

goodwill impairment 
during the second quarter of  in an effort to cut costs and achieve operational efficiencies  we commenced the termination of all personnel of the former dva  which performed engineering development services 
in conjunction with this action  it was determined that the carrying amount of the company s remaining goodwill  which was originally recorded with our acquisition of dva and related to our discontinued operations  exceeded its fair value 
as such  we measured the impairment loss by the amount the carrying value exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill 
the amount of the non cash impairment loss was  the fair value of goodwill was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
interest and other income and interest expense 
interest and other income and interest expense were from discontinued operations and consisted of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  and interest expense on equipment financing and short term debt 
interest and other income decreased from for the twelve months ended december  to for the twelve months ended december   primarily due to declining average cash and short term investment balances and to declining interest rates 
during the twelve months ended december   we earned interest on average cash balances solely from discontinued operations of approximately  and incurred interest expense related to our equipment financing facility in the amount of in comparison  during the twelve months ended december  we earned interest on average cash balances that are consolidated with discontinued operations  of approximately  and incurred interest expense related to our insurance financing in the amount of gain on sale of intellectual property and investment in tvgateway 
on september   we sold certain intellectual property rights and certain software and equipment related to our discontinued itv operations to tvgateway  llc  for million in cash  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement the purchase agreement  which we executed with tvgateway in august pursuant to the purchase agreement we retained a royalty free license to the intellectual property rights that were sold  enabling us to use the intellectual property rights to continue to conduct our business as then being conducted 
concurrently with the execution of the purchase agreement  we and tvgateway also entered into a redemption agreement pursuant to which we redeemed our equity interest in tvgateway for  in cash  paid concurrently with the execution of the redemption agreement 
the intellectual property rights had previously been expensed as incurred 
similarly  we did not carry an equity balance for our interest in tvgateway 
the aggregate effect of these transactions was a gain of million  which is reported in the loss from discontinued operations in income taxes 
the company has incurred net operating losses since inception and accordingly had no income taxes and has not recorded any income tax benefit for those losses 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our primary source of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents that are highly liquid  are of high quality investment grade and have original maturities of less than three months 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and no short term investments as compared to cash and equivalents of  and no short term investments at december  net cash used in continuing operations was  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to  used for the same period in this increase in net cash used for continuing operations was primarily attributable to our increase in expenditures during the twelve months ended december   related to the video phone business 
we recorded bad debt expense in the amount of from discontinued operations in to reflect our current assessment of the collectability of certain receivables 
cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations during the twelve months ended december   totaled  compared to  provided during the same period in pursuant to the purchase agreement we retained a royalty free license to the intellectual property rights that were sold  enabling us to use the intellectual property rights to continue to conduct our business as then being conducted 
concurrently with the execution of the purchase agreement  we and tvgateway also entered into a redemption agreement pursuant to which we redeemed our equity interest in tvgateway for  in cash  paid concurrently with the execution of the redemption agreement 
the intellectual property rights had previously been expensed as incurred 
similarly  we did not carry an equity balance for our interest in tvgateway 
the aggregate effect of these transactions was a gain of million  which is reported in the loss from discontinued operations in operations and liquidity 
to date  we have funded operations primarily through private sales of equity securities and through an initial public offering of common stock in april as of december  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  the operating cash usage from continuing operations for the twelve months ended december  and was  and  respectively 
as of december  we have of outstanding debt and our assets are not pledged as collateral 
we continue to evaluate the possibilities to obtain additional financing through public or private equity or debt offerings  bank debt financing  asset securitizations  or from other sources 
such additional financing would be subject to the risk of availability  may be dilutive to our shareholders  or could impose restrictions on operating activities 
there can be no assurance that this additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
with the private placement of our common stock  together with additional rights and warrants  aggregate gross proceeds received of million in january  the private placement of our common stock in april providing proceeds of million  the june private placement of our redeemable preferred stock aggregating proceeds received of million  the december private placement of common stock of  the exercise of additional investment rights and warrants of million in december  january and february  and the exercise by employees and former employees of options throughout  january and february aggregating gross proceeds of  we project we will have sufficient funding to continue operations through  assuming no additional funding is received and assuming no impact from sales 
depending on the timing and magnitude of the ramp up of video phone sales  it is possible that our current cash may be sufficient to get us to a cash break even position 
we do however have an obligation to pay individuals on  as well as to redeem our outstanding series a preferred stock see part ii  item  sale of unregistered securities for additional information upon maturity  or at the earlier option of a holder of these securities 
under certain limited circumstances  however  we may be forced to make such payments and redemptions with cash instead of shares of our common stock 
in such event our ability to fund continuing operations would be negatively impacted 
no assurances can be given that sufficient sales  if any  will materialize  or that a funding transaction can be consummated prior to the depletion of our available cash 
we however remain hopeful that sales will materialize and or that sufficient funding can be developed through funding or ongoing operations to continue our operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  and we limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to any one issue  issuer and type of investment 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were  most of which were securities having a maturity of less than three months 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  management believes a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that had the average yield of our investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for the twelve months ended december  would have decreased by approximately this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on our total investments 
foreign currency exchange risk 
although we transact business in various foreign countries  the principal portion of our business is in the united states and substantially all of our revenues and costs to date have been denominated in us dollars 
although our agreement with mototech  our contract manufacturer in taiwan  is denominated in us dollars  their material acquisition costs are subject to exchange rate changes that could impact our product costs

 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities  which are entities that either a do not have equity investors with vesting rights or b have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
the interpretation is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after february  in december  the fasb published fasb fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin r  among other things  defers the effective date of implementation for certain entities 
the revised interpretation is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march   with the exception of structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities  for which the statement is effective for periods ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on worldgate s results of operations or financial position

 chapter inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal

factors affecting our business condition in addition to other information in this form k  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and our business 
investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk  and you should be able to bear the complete loss of your investment 
we also caution you that this form k includes forward looking statements that are based on management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management 
future events and circumstances and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
you should carefully consider the risks described below  the other information in this form k  the documents incorporated by reference herein and the risk factors discussed in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission when evaluating our company and our business 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known by us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business could be harmed 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock would decline 
our itv business has accounted for most of our revenues to date  we cannot reliably project our continued revenues  and we expect to incur significant losses for an indefinite period of time 
the itv business  including the assets we sold in the tvgateway transaction  has historically accounted for substantially all of our revenue 
since we have discontinued the itv business and transitioned to become a developer  manufacturer and seller of video phone products we cannot reliably predict our future revenues  and no assurances can be provided as to the amount of ongoing revenues  if any  or to the periods in which any such revenues may be received 
our video phone business involves the development of a new product line with no market penetration in an undeveloped market sector 
we do not expect our video phone business to produce any significant revenues in the near term  and we plan to operate at a loss for at least the near term 
we cannot predict to what extent our video phone product will begin to produce revenues  or whether we will ever reach profitability 
if we are unable to achieve significant levels of recurring revenue from our video phone business  our losses will likely continue indefinitely 
if this occurs  the market price of our common stock and our viability as a going concern could suffer 
we expect to be increasingly dependent on a single line of business that currently has no history of revenues 
we cannot predict our future results because our video phone business has no operating history 
our primary line of business has become the development of video phone products and technology 
we are still in the process of launching our first product based on this technology and consequently there are currently no substantial revenues from this line of business 
given the lack of operating history in the video phone business  it is difficult to predict our future results 
investors should consider the risks and uncertainties that we may encounter as a pre revenue stage company in a new and unproven market 
these uncertainties include our ability to design and engineer products having the technological features planned for the video phone product line in a cost efficient manner  consumer demand for  and acceptance of  the video phone business products  our ability to enter into appropriate distribution relationships for the product  our ability to demonstrate the benefits of our products and services to end users  our unproven and evolving business model  unfavorable economic conditions in the technology industry  decreased capital spending on technology due to adverse economic conditions  and global economic conditions 
our video phone technology and products remain subject to significant uncertainty 
our video phone technology and products are in the early commercialization stage and have not been fully proven 
the market for products related to video telephony is characterized by uncertain user and customer requirements  and the emergence of new communications standards and practices 
each of these characteristics could impact our video phone products  intellectual property and system designs 
the successful development of our products is subject to the risks that our proposed product is found to be ineffective for the intended purposes  the proposed product is uneconomical to manufacture or market or does not achieve broad market acceptance  and third parties hold proprietary rights that preclude us from marketing the product 
significant undetected errors or delays in new products or releases may affect market acceptance of our product 
there can be no assurance that  despite our testing  errors will not be found in the initial product or subsequent releases after the commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of customers or failure to achieve market acceptance 
in addition  our video phone technology and product will need to be compatible with a broad array of disparate technologies in order to be interoperable with other products routinely used in hsd operations such as routers  switches  operating systems and billing systems software 
without compatibility  we may not achieve market acceptance or demand for our products within our target base of customers because our products will not operate with many of the applications the target customers currently use 
we will rely on third parties to provide certain components and services for our video phone products 
if our vendors fail to deliver their products in a reliable  timely and cost efficient manner  our business will suffer 
we expect to depend on relationships with third parties such as contract manufacturing companies  chip design companies and others who may be sole source providers of key components and services critical for the product we are developing in our video phone business 
a formal relationship with mototech  inc has been established for the volume manufacture of ojo 
if mototech  inc or other providers of components and or manufacturing services do not produce these components or provide their services on a timely basis  if the components or services do not meet our specifications and quality control standards  or if the components or services are otherwise flawed  we may have to delay product delivery  or recall or replace unacceptable products 
in addition  such failures could damage our reputation and could adversely affect our operating results 
as a result  we could lose potential customers and any revenues that we may have at that time may decline dramatically 
we will rely on third parties to provide certain marketing and distribution services for our video phone products 
if our vendors fail to deliver their services in a reliable  timely and cost efficient manner  our business will suffer 
we have a formal distribution agreement with motorola  inc for the marketing and distribution of our ojo video phone 
under this agreement  motorola and its distribution partners are responsible for the worldwide marketing and distribution of the ojo video phone 
if they are not successful  our operating results will be adversely affected  our revenue could be significantly reduced and we could lose potential customers 
we may not be able to meet our product development objectives or market expectations 
our video phone product development efforts are inherently difficult to manage and keep on schedule and there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our development objectives or to meet market expectations 
in addition to development delays  we may experience substantial cost overruns in completing development of our product 
the technological feasibility for some aspects of the product that we envision is not completely established 
the product being developed by us may contain undetected flaws when introduced 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by us and by potential customers  flaws will not be found in the product  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance 
we may be unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce the product in a timely manner in response to changing customer requirements 
further  there can be no assurance that while we are attempting to finish development of our product  a competitor will not introduce a similar product 
the introduction by a competitor of either a similar product before we introduce our product  or a superior alternative to our product  may diminish our technological advantage  render our product and technologies partially or wholly obsolete  or require substantial re engineering of our product in order to become commercially acceptable 
our failure to maintain our product development schedules  avoid cost overruns and undetected errors or introduce a product that is superior to competing products would have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to achieve competitive pricing in the marketplace 
because video phone products are relatively new to the marketplace there is no established market pricing 
our pricing for the ojo video phone may be considered high for a consumer product offering 
although we anticipate cost reductions and volume manufacturing will reduce the price of our products we cannot be assured that reductions in our pricing will occur or if such reductions are achieved whether the extent of such reductions will provide competitive market pricing 
we are highly dependent on our key personnel to manage our business  and because of competition for qualified personnel we may not be able to recruit or retain necessary personnel 
our continued growth and success depend to a significant degree on the continued services of our senior management and other key employees and our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced technical  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
we have historically been a developer of products related to itv 
our video phone business represents an expansion into the development of hsd communications hardware and software products in which we have limited experience 
as we enter this new line of business  we also expect to encounter new product development challenges  new customer requirements  new competitors and other new business challenges  with which our existing management may be unfamiliar 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in recruiting new personnel or in retaining existing personnel 
none of our employees is subject to a long term employment agreement 
the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to attract additional qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we may experience increased compensation costs in order to attract and retain skilled employees 
we may not be successful in developing or maintaining strong distribution channels for our video phone products 
the success of the video phone business depends on developing strong relationships with cable operators and other hsd communications providers and distribution channel partners who are selling services to end users 
we plan to rely primarily on motorola and our hsd operator and electronics distribution channel relationships to market our video phone products 
if we are not successful in creating a strong distribution channel in a timely manner  we may not gain significant sales 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving hsd communications market 
the market for products that utilize hsd communications is still developing and there can be no assurance that our product will ever achieve market acceptance 
since we have no existing customers for our video phone business  cable operators and other hsd network providers must be convinced to buy our video phone product 
to the extent we do not achieve growth  it will be difficult for us to generate meaningful revenue or to achieve profitability 
we may not be able to protect intellectual property of our video phone business against third party infringements or claims of infringement 
failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in a loss of our exclusivity or the right to use our video phone technology 
we plan to rely on patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright law to protect our video phone intellectual property 
although we have filed multiple patent applications for our technology  our patent position is subject to complex factual and legal issues that may give rise to uncertainty as to the validity  scope and enforceability of a particular patent 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that any patents will be issued pursuant to our current or future patent applications or that patents issued pursuant to such applications will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the rights granted under any such patents will provide competitive advantages to us or be adequate to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights 
in addition  effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable  limited or not applied for in certain foreign countries 
we also seek to protect our proprietary intellectual property  including intellectual property that may not be patented or patentable  in part by confidentiality agreements and  if applicable  inventor s rights agreements with our current and future strategic partners and employees 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that such persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of these relationships 
some of our video phone intellectual property includes technologies and processes that may be similar to the patented technologies and processes of third parties 
if we do not adequately secure our freedom to use our video phone technology  we may have to pay others for rights to use their intellectual property  pay damages for infringement or misappropriation or be enjoined from using such intellectual property 
if we are found to be infringing third party patents  we do not know whether we will be able to obtain licenses to use such patents on acceptable terms  if at all 
while we are not currently engaged in any material intellectual property disputes or litigation  we could become subject to lawsuits in which it is alleged that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or commence lawsuits against others who we believe are infringing upon our rights 
our involvement in intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense to us  adversely affecting the development of the challenged product or intellectual property and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation concludes favorably for our company 
legal and regulatory developments could have adverse consequences for our business 
the legal and regulatory environment that pertains to our business is uncertain and changing rapidly 
new legislation or regulations could be introduced that could substantially impact our ability to launch and promote the ojo video phone 
for example  in the united states  the federal communications commission fcc could undertake an examination of whether to impose surcharges or additional regulations upon certain providers of internet protocol  or ip  based communication services 
the imposition of regulations on ip communications services may negatively impact our business 
the use of the high speed data infrastructure as a commercial marketplace is at an early stage of development 
demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services over the high speed data  or hsd  infrastructure are still uncertain 
we cannot predict whether customers will be willing to shift their traditional telephone activities online 
the hsd infrastructure may not prove to be a viable commercial marketplace for a number of reasons  including concerns about security  internet congestion  quality of service issues  inconsistent service  and lack of cost effective  high speed access 
if the use of the hsd infrastructure as a commercial marketplace does not continue to grow  we may not be able to grow our customer base  which may prevent us from achieving profitability 
we may not have sufficient working capital to fund our continuing video phone business  and we may be unable to obtain additional capital 
if we obtain additional financing  you may suffer significant dilution 
despite the receipt of proceeds from the tvgateway transaction and several private placements of our securities  we may need to seek additional third party investment during in order to provide additional working capital for our video phone business 
we cannot be certain that financing from third parties will be available on acceptable terms to us or at all 
the extent and timing of our future capital requirements will depend upon several factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our products  the degree of competition for our products  and our level of expenditures  including those for product development  sales and marketing 
if our capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
the levels of funding of pre revenue stage companies generally by both venture funds and strategic investors have fallen dramatically in the past few years 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business 
if we are unable to secure such additional financing  we will have to curtail or suspend our business activities and may have to seek protection of the bankruptcy courts 
if that happens  you could lose your entire investment 
if we cannot raise additional financing on acceptable terms  we may not be able to continue to operate our business as a going concern 
further  if we issue equity securities  our shareholders may experience severe dilution of their ownership percentage  and the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
if our common stock is listed on the nasdaq national market or the nasdaq smallcap market at the time of the proposed equity financing resulting in the sale and issuance of twenty percent or more of the outstanding shares of our capital stock  we may be required to obtain stockholder approval of such issuance 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any necessary stockholder approval  and the failure to obtain such approval could limit our ability to obtain needed capital 
due to the factors mentioned herein  our accountants have stated in their audit report that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
in the event that our common stock is delisted from nasdaq smallcap market  it may be subject to the requirements of the rules relating to penny stocks 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq smallcap market  which has requirements for the continued listing of stock 
if we fail to continue to meet these listing requirements we will become subject to delisting 
for example  if our common stock trades below for consecutive trading days  or if we fail to meet any of the other listing requirements including the market capitalization and minimum stockholders equity requirements  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market 
if our shares are delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  they are likely to become subject to the sec penny stock rules  which could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock 
these rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers that sell low priced securities to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors  and require the delivery of a disclosure schedule explaining the nature and risks of the penny stock market 
as a result  the ability or willingness of broker dealers to sell or make a market in our common stock might decline  and you could find it more difficult to sell your stock 
our stock price is volatile 
the trading price for our common stock has been volatile  ranging from a sales price of in april  to a sales price of over per share in december the price has changed dramatically over short periods with changes of over percent in a single day 
an investment in our stock is subject to such volatility and  consequently  is subject to significant risk 
prior offerings of our common stock may have an adverse impact on the market value of our stock 
during and we issued shares of our common stock as part of various private placements to certain institutional investors and as part of that transaction filed three registration statements  which provided for the sale or distribution of these shares by these institutional investors 
when these investors sell their shares we will not receive any proceeds from the sales 
the sale of these blocks of stock  or even the possibility of its sale  may adversely affect the trading market for our common stock and reduce the price available in that market 
in connection with these private placements  we also issued warrants and additional investment rights to purchase shares of common stock 
the existence of such rights to acquire common stock at fixed prices may prove a hindrance to our efforts to raise future equity and debt funding  and the exercise of such rights will dilute the percentage ownership interest of our stockholders and may dilute the value of their ownership 
the possible future sale of shares issuable on the exercise of outstanding warrants and additional investment rights could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock 
further  the holders of the outstanding warrants and additional investment rights may exercise them at a time when we would otherwise be able to obtain additional equity capital on terms more favorable to us 
our board of directors right to authorize additional shares of preferred stock could adversely impact the rights of holders of our common stock 
our board of directors currently has the right to designate and authorize the issuance of one or more series of our preferred stock with such voting  dividend and other rights as our directors may determine 
the board of directors can designate new series of preferred stock without the approval of the holders of our common stock 
the rights of holders of our common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of any holders of shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future  including without limitation dilution of the equity ownership percentage of our holders of common stock and their voting power if we issue preferred stock with voting rights 
additionally  the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock
