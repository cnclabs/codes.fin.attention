overview vivus  inc is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the research  development and commercialization of products to restore sexual function in women and men 
our product pipeline includes four clinical stage product candidates  each of which targets an estimated existing or potential market in excess of billion annually 
alista  currently in phase trials  is our product candidate for the treatment of female sexual arousal disorder 
testosterone mdts  which recently completed a positive phase trial  is our product candidate to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder 
evamist  currently in phase development  is our product candidate to alleviate symptoms associated with menopause 
avanafil  currently in phase trials  is our phosphodiesterase type  or pde  inhibitor product candidate for the treatment of erectile dysfunction 
in  we launched muse alprostadil in the united states and  together with our partners in  internationally 
we market muse as a prescription product for the treatment of erectile dysfunction 
for international markets  we have entered into supply and distribution agreements with established pharmaceutical companies to market and distribute muse in various foreign countries 
muse was the first minimally invasive therapy for erectile dysfunction available at a time when only more invasive therapies existed 
developing and bringing muse to the market provided us with experience in clinical and regulatory matters when the market for erectile dysfunction was in its infancy 
our product pipeline we currently have four research and development programs targeting female and male sexual health product indication status patent expiry and number alista topical alprostadil female sexual arousal disorder fsad phase ongoing us  testosterone mdts hypoactive sexual desire disorder hsdd phase completed us  evamist estradiol mdts menopausal symptoms phase ongoing us  avanafil pde inhibitor erectile dysfunction ed phase ongoing us  our corporate strategy our goal is to become a leader in the development and commercialization of innovative proprietary products for the treatment of female and male sexual health 
we intend to achieve this by capitalizing on our clinical and regulatory expertise and experience in the field of sexual health to advance the development of product candidates in our pipeline  establishing strategic relationships with marketing partners to maximize sales potential for our products that require significant commercial support  and licensing complementary clinical stage products or technologies with competitive advantages from third parties for new and established markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  doubtful accounts  income taxes  restructuring  inventories and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product returns we record reserves for anticipated returns of expired or damaged product in the united states 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of product returns can be made based on historical experience and our monitoring of inventory levels in the wholesale distribution channel 
revisions in returns estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
there is no right of return on product sold internationally subsequent to shipment  thus no returns reserve is needed 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
for all periods presented  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
we have also recorded income taxes payable for estimated current tax liabilities 
we monitor these estimated liabilities and adjust them as conditions warrant 
restructuring in  we experienced a significant restructuring and recorded restructuring related reserves for severance and employee costs  inventory obsolescence  raw material purchase commitments  property and related commitments  marketing commitments and other commitments 
we monitor the adequacy of these liabilities and have made periodic adjustments as conditions have changed 
inventories we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
during the quarter ended september   we established significant reserves against its inventory to align with new estimates of expected future demand for muse 
vivus had built up its inventory level prior to and after the launch of viagra and had not anticipated the impact that viagra would have on the demand for muse 
as of december   the remaining inventory reserve balance is million 
this remaining balance is related to the raw materials inventory that we previously estimated would not be used 
some portion of the fully reserved inventory was used in production in  and in the fourth quarter of  we stopped using this fully reserved inventory in production and determined that we would not likely use this inventory in future production 
to the extent that this inventory was used in production in and  it was charged to cost of goods sold at a zero basis  which had a favorable impact on cost of goods sold 
available for sale securities available for sale securities represent investments in debt securities that are stated at fair value 
we restrict our cash investments to direct obligations of the united states treasury  federal agency securities which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the united states government  and corporate securities  including commercial paper  rated a p or better 
the difference between amortized cost cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts which are recognized as adjustments to interest income and fair value  representing unrealized holding gains or losses  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income  a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
the company s policy is to record investments in debt securities as available for sale because the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity 
any gains and losses on the sale of debt securities are determined on a specific identification basis and are included in interest and other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
available for sale securities with original maturities beyond one year from the balance sheet date are classified as non current 
contingencies and litigation we are periodically involved in disputes and litigation related to a variety of matters 
when it is probable that we will experience a loss  and that loss is quantifiable  we record appropriate reserves 
results of operations years ended december  and for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  or net loss per share as compared to a net loss of  or no net loss per share  during the same period in the net loss was higher in as compared to primarily due to lower product sales of muse in the united states and internationally and higher research and development expenses including an aggregate million in one time charges for licensing and milestone payments associated with three of the development programs in the pipeline  increased clinical trial and project activity for alista  avanafil  estradiol and testosterone  as well as the lack of the million in other revenue resulting from the settlement of the janssen pharmaceutica arbitration claim 
we anticipate continued losses over the next several years because we expect muse sales to continue to decline  and we plan to continue to invest in clinical development of our current research and development product candidates to bring those potential products to market 
revenue 
product revenue from the sales of muse in the united states for the year ended december  was million compared to million last year  a decrease of million 
international product revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease of  compared to last year 
worldwide product revenues from the sales of muse were million in  a decrease of million  or  from the worldwide sales of muse in the change in revenues is mainly due to decreased demand for muse 
the launch of new pde inhibitors and the associated direct to consumer advertising and aggressive sampling opportunities for all pde inhibitors contributed to the decline in demand for muse 
in addition  based on the current demand for muse  as measured by independent third party prescription data  we estimate purchases made by wholesalers ahead of our annual price increase in the fourth quarter of  represent approximately to months of demand 
as a result of the decrease in demand and the strategic buying in the fourth quarter by our wholesalers  combined with the promotional efforts of all pde inhibitors  we anticipate worldwide revenues of muse will decline in cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold for was million  as compared to million for  an increase of  in accordance with gaap  in we reduced the carrying cost of alprostadil  the active ingredient in muse  to zero due to excess quantities on hand at that time 
although the cost basis for alprostadil was reduced to zero we continued to use this active ingredient as allowed by the fda in the production of muse  in and by utilizing the inventory that had previously been written down to zero  we lowered our cost of sales for and by  and million  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of we stopped using the alprostadil that had previously been reduced to a zero cost basis 
the increase in cost of goods sold in as compared to is primarily due to use of recently purchased alprostadil that is expensed at its full cost of acquisition 
we expect cost of goods sold to increase in as we are no longer using the zero cost basis alprostadil in production 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  as compared to million for the same period in during  we entered into exclusive licensing agreements with a subsidiary of acrux under which we will develop and commercialize  in the united states  an estradiol spray for the alleviation of the symptoms of menopause and a testosterone spray for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women 
we expensed a total million of licensing fees under the terms of the agreements in a portion of these licensing fees was paid in february and september  with the remainder   to be paid in june in addition  during the first half of  we initiated a phase clinical trial with avanafil  our oral phosphodiesterase type pde inhibitor being studied for the treatment of erectile dysfunction 
under the terms of our development  licensing and supply agreement with tanabe we expensed a million milestone obligation to tanabe in we intend to pay this milestone obligation in march the expenses associated with the avanafil phase clinical trials in resulted in an additional million expense 
increased clinical trial and project activity for alista  estradiol and testosterone resulted in incremental spending for these projects of million during additionally  salary  benefit and consulting expenses increased in support of our ongoing projects 
we anticipate that our research and development expenditures will continue to increase in and we do not expect to recognize revenue from sales of any new product candidates being developed through our research and development efforts for several years 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million as compared to million for  or million higher than last year primarily due to an increase in spending for investor and public relations activities and marketing programs  as well as the absence of the reimbursement of previously incurred legal fees and other expenses related to the settlement of the janssen pharmaceutica arbitration claim in the third quarter of interest income and expense 
interest income for was  as compared to  for declining balances of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities contributed to the reduction in interest income 
interest expense of  in was related to the acrux and tanabe milestone liabilities 
we did not have any interest expense in provision for income taxes 
in  we recorded a net tax provision of  for minimum state income taxes and uk income taxes  both due for for the year ended december   we recorded a tax benefit based on an updated estimate of our tax liabilities 
years ended december  and for  we reported a net loss of  or no net loss per share as compared to a net loss of million or net loss per share for the decrease in the net loss in was due primarily to revenue recognized as the result of the resolution of our arbitration claim against janssen pharmaceutica in the third quarter of reduced operating expenses also contributed to the lower loss 
revenue 
united states product revenue for was million  as compared to million for the decrease in revenue was due to a decrease in the number of muse units sold in versus due to declining demand 
international revenue was million for  compared to million for higher international product revenue in was due to a full year of sales to our international distribution partner  meda 
initial shipments to meda began in the fourth quarter of milestone and other revenue was million primarily due to million of other revenue resulting from the resolution of our arbitration claim against janssen pharmaceutica with the american arbitration association related to payments owing to vivus under a previously terminated distribution agreement between the companies 
million of other revenue represented amounts due from janssen pharmaceutica under the arbitration award 
the remaining million resulted from recognizing janssen pharmaceutica related revenue that was previously deferred pending the outcome of the arbitration 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold for was million  compared to million for the during  we used certain raw material inventory of alprostadil  the cost basis of which had been reduced to zero in prior years 
the use of this raw material which had a zero cost basis had a favorable impact on our cost of goods sold during of million 
the amount includes a reduction in cost of goods sold of  as a result of settlements of previously recognized purchase commitment liabilities for our major raw material  alprostadil 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  million lower than the same period in the previous year 
the decrease was due to greater clinical trial activity in as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to the reimbursement in by janssen pharmaceutica of legal fees and other expenses totaling  related to the janssen pharmaceutica arbitration that were previously expensed in interest income 
interest income for was  as compared to million for despite the increase in our investments  lower interest rates contributed to the reduction in interest income 
benefit for income taxes 
we recorded a tax benefit of  for based on an estimate of our net tax liabilities 
in  we recorded a tax benefit of  based on an estimate of our net tax liabilities as well as filing for a refund of previously paid alternative minimum taxes which became available due to a tax law change 
liquidity and capital resources cash 
unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities totaled million at december   compared with million at december  the decrease was primarily due to decreased revenues in as well as increased research and development spending 
since inception  we have financed operations primarily from the issuance of equity securities 
through december   we raised million from financing activities and had an accumulated deficit of million 
available for sale securities 
the company focuses on liquidity and capital preservation in its investments in available for sale securities 
the company restricts its cash investments to direct obligations of the united states treasury  federal agency securities which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the united states government  and corporate securities  including commercial paper  rated a p or better 
the company sequences the maturities of its investments consistent with its cash forecasts 
the weighted average maturity of the portfolio is not to exceed months 
as investments mature  the company re invests the money by purchasing additional securities 
as the company needs cash for its operating expenses  it sells such investment securities 
because the company sequences maturities consistent with its cash forecasts  realized gains and losses on the sales of securities are typically insignificant 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts at december  was million  as compared to million at december  the increase in the accounts receivable balance at december  is due to of the sales occurring in the month of december 
currently  the company does not have any significant concerns related to accounts receivable or collections 
as of february   we had collected all of the december  accounts receivable 
liabilities 
total liabilities were million at december  million higher than at december  accrued research and clinical expenses and accrued licensing fees increased million due to liabilities for the future payment of milestones totaling million to acrux and tanabe and to increased liabilities for clinical trial expense in notes payable increased million due to borrowing under the agreement we signed with tanabe in the first quarter of for a line of credit of up to million to be used for the development of avanafil  and accrued chargeback reserves increased million due to the increase in december sales of muse as compared to december operating activities 
our operating activities used million of cash during and provided million of cash in the cash used in  can be attributed to our net operating loss of million  an increase in our accounts receivable balance of million offset by a million increase in accrued research and development expenses  non cash depreciation expense of million  and a million increase in accrued chargeback reserves 
the cash provided by operations in was due to a million decrease in our accounts receivable balance and million of non cash depreciation expenses included in our  net loss  offset by an increase in our inventories due to the purchase of million of alprostadil 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in as compared to the use of million in  respectively 
the fluctuations from period to period are due primarily to the timing of purchases  sales and maturity of investment securities 
financing activities 
financing activities provided cash of million and million during and  respectively 
these amounts include the proceeds from the exercise of stock options in and  borrowings from tanabe during and the private placement of  shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of million in we anticipate that our existing capital resources combined with anticipated future cash flows will be sufficient to support our operating needs for at least the next two years 
however  we anticipate that we will be required to obtain additional financing to fund the development of our research and development pipeline in future periods as well as to support the possible launch of any future products 
in particular  we expect to make other substantial payments to acrux and tanabe in accordance with our agreements with them in connection with the licensing of certain compounds 
these payments are based on certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
in addition  we are required to make royalty payments on any future product sales 
in the first quarter of  we signed an agreement for a secured line of credit with tanabe  allowing us to borrow up to million to be used for the development of avanafil formerly ta  our erectile dysfunction compound currently in phase clinical trials 
the secured line of credit may be drawn upon quarterly and each quarterly borrowing has a month term and bears interest at the annual rate of 
there are no financial covenants associated with this secured line of credit 
as of december  we had long term notes payable to tanabe of million  and million of available credit under this agreement 
on december   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec which allows us to offer and sell up to an aggregate of million of common stock from time to time in one or more offerings 
the terms of any such future offering would be established at the time of such offering 
on february   we filed a prospectus supplement with the securities and exchange commission relating to an underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock under the existing shelf registration statement and supplement thereto 
on march   we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share providing us with net proceeds of million 
we also granted the underwriters a day option to purchase up to an additional  shares to cover over allotments 
to obtain additional capital when needed  we will evaluate alternative financing sources  including  but not limited to  the issuance of equity or debt securities  corporate alliances  assets sales  joint ventures and licensing agreements 
however  there can be no assurance that funding will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  management may be required to explore alternatives to reduce cash used by operating activities  including the termination of research and development efforts that may appear to be promising to us  the sale of certain assets and the reduction in overall operating activities 
our future capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  the scope  timing and results of pre clinical testing and clinical trials  patient recruitment and enrollment in current and future clinical trials  results of operations  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the rate of technological advances  ongoing determinations of the potential commercial success of our products under development  the level of resources devoted to sales and marketing capabilities  and the activities of competitors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the securities and exchange commission s rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify our potential losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes

a significant portion of all of our investments in cash equivalents and available for sale securities are in money market funds that hold short term investment grade commercial paper  treasury bills or other united states government obligations 
currently  this reduces our exposure to long term interest rate changes
