item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere herein 
executive overview in  we delivered on our joint strategic goals of growing our business while simultaneously generating net free cash flow  which we define as having cash provided by operating activities exceeding cash used for investing 
we increased our guest pay room base during the year by more than  net new rooms  all of which were installed with our digital system 
as of december   of our guest pay interactive room base  or  rooms  were equipped with a digital system 
cash from operations increased to million for the year 
after deducting all capital investment activities  we generated million of net free cash flow during the first time in our public company history that cash from operations exceeded cash used for investing activities 
this represents an million and a million improvement over and  respectively 
in addition to the continued expansion of our digital base  we managed and monitored capital expenditures per new or converted room 
new digital room installation costs decreased during the year to per room compared to in  while the cost of converting an analog room to our digital platform decreased to per room 
technological advancements  engineering development and product segmentation have driven the reduction of our capital costs per room 
in  we continued to promote the sale and installation of high speed internet equipment coupled with maintenance and customer support services 
additionally  we introduced our interactive television system and content to the healthcare industry 
in july  we announced the formation of a sales and marketing relationship with mckesson corporation  the world s largest healthcare services and information technology company  to offer our interactive television system and content as part of mckesson s horizon patient vision system 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the first installation of our interactive system in a hospital 
under the relationship lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents with mckesson  we sell our interactive system to mckesson and provide to them recurring support for entertainment content  software maintenance and technical field service for a fixed monthly fee 
we will continue to pursue opportunities within the healthcare market and expect to install additional hospitals in guest pay interactive services 
our primary source of revenue is providing in room  interactive television services to the lodging industry  for which the hotel guest pays on a per view  hourly or daily basis 
our services include on demand movies  network based video games  music and music videos  internet on television which does not require a laptop  and television on demand programming 
our total guest generated revenue depends on a number of factors  including the number of rooms equipped with our system 
we can increase revenue over time by increasing the number of rooms served by our interactive systems 
our ability to expand our room base is dependent on a number of factors  including the attractiveness of our technology  service and support to hotels currently operating without an interactive television system  newly constructed hotel properties  and hotels with expiring contracts currently served by our competitors 
the variety of services offered at the hotel 
rooms equipped with our digital system generate higher revenue than rooms equipped with our tape based system primarily because they offer a greater variety of services and content choices 
we plan to continue to grow the revenue we generate per average room by the installation of our digital system in all newly contracted rooms and by converting selected tape based rooms to our digital system in exchange for long term contract extensions 
the popularity  timeliness and amount of content offered at the hotel 
our revenues vary to a certain degree with the number  timeliness and popularity of movie content available for viewing 
historically  a decrease in the availability of popular movie content has from time to time adversely impacted revenue 
although not completely within our control  we seek to program and promote the most popular available movie content and other content to maximize revenue and gross profit 
the price of the service purchased by the hotel guest 
generally  we control the prices charged for our products and services and manage pricing in an effort to maximize revenue and overall gross profit 
we establish pricing based on such things as the demographics of the property served  the popularity of the content and overall economic conditions 
our technology enables us to measure popularity of our content and make decisions to best position such content and optimize revenue from such content 
the occupancy rate at the property 
our revenue also varies depending on hotel occupancy rates  which are subject to a number of factors  including seasonality  general economic conditions and world events  such as terrorist threats or public health issues 
occupancy rates are typically higher during the second and third quarters due to seasonal travel patterns 
we target higher occupancy properties in diverse demographic and geographic locations in an effort to mitigate occupancy related risks 
the primary direct costs of providing guest pay interactive services are license fees paid to major motion picture studios  which are based on a percent of guest generated revenue  for non exclusive distribution rights of recently released major motion pictures  commissions paid to our hotel customers  which are also based on a percent of guest generated revenue  fixed monthly programming charges paid primarily to directv for satellite delivered basic and premium television programming  internet connectivity costs  license fees  which are based on a percent of guest generated revenue  for television on demand  music  music video and video games  and one time license fees paid for independent films  most of which are non rated and intended for mature audiences

table of contents other services 
in addition to the sales of equipment to our international markets  during  we continued to promote the sale and installation of high speed internet equipment coupled with maintenance and customer support services 
while this is a highly competitive area  we believe we have important advantages as a result of our existing hotel customer relationships  our nationwide field service network  and our hour call center which provides service days a week 
in  we began offering our interactive television systems in the healthcare industry through a sales and marketing relationship with mckesson corporation 
in this market  we intend to sell our interactive systems to mckesson or individual healthcare facilities and earn recurring revenues from the provision of service and maintenance activities 
we also generate revenue from the sale of content and services directly to our hotel customers  which are generally provided free to hotel guests 
included in these services is satellite delivered basic and premium television programming for which the hotel pays us a fixed monthly charge per room 
we compete with local cable television operators by tailoring different programming packages to provide specific channels desired by the hotel subscriber  which typically reduces the overall cost to the hotel for the services provided 
key metrics rooms served one of the metrics we monitor is the growth  net of de installations  of our guest pay interactive room base 
de installation activity has not had a material effect on our growth  historically averaging approximately of total installed rooms per year 
in the years indicated  we installed our systems in the following number of net new rooms and had the following total rooms installed as of december new guest pay interactive rooms total guest pay interactive rooms total rooms served amounts shown are net of de installations 
guest pay interactive rooms are equipped with our interactive television system  which includes both digital and tape based systems 
total rooms served include guest pay interactive rooms  rooms served by international licensees  and properties receiving only basic and premium television services 
lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents digital room growth we continue to expand our digital base as we install our digital system in all newly contracted rooms as well as converting select tape based served rooms to the digital system in exchange for contract extensions 
rooms equipped with our digital system generally generate greater revenue since the range of services is greater than rooms equipped with our tape based systems 
our goal is to have approximately of our room base installed with a digital system by the end of digital room installations total digital rooms installed digital rooms as a percent of total guest pay interactive rooms cost of installation the average per room cost associated with a digital installation has continued to decline due to our ongoing reengineering  which simplifies the system while adding enhancements  lower component costs  and reduced cost of assembly and installation 
the following table sets forth our average installation and conversion cost per room during the years ended december average cost per room new installation average cost per room conversion revenue per room guest pay revenue can fluctuate based on several factors including the popularity of movie content and the availability and popularity of free alternative programming such as the olympics 
total guest pay revenue continues to grow  although movie revenue per room has decreased  as we have expanded our product choices and other interactive services available through our digital television and our high speed internet access systems 
the following table sets forth the components of our guest pay revenue per room for the years ended december average monthly revenue per room movies other interactive services total per guest pay room lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents operating expense per room we plan to continue to manage and monitor the operating expenses per room in order to increase the level of cash flow our business generates 
guest pay operations expenses consist of costs directly related to the operation and maintenance of systems at hotel sites 
selling  general and administrative expense primarily includes administrative payroll costs  engineering development costs and legal  professional and compliance costs 
the following table sets forth our operating expenses per room and sg a as a percent of revenue during the years ended december guest pay operating expenses sg a expense sg a as a percent of total revenue free cash flow one of our goals is to generate net free cash flow  which we define as having cash provided by operating activities exceeding cash used for investing 
we generally seek to generate net free cash flow to reduce our historical reliance on external financing to grow our business 
in addition to increasing revenue and controlling expenses  we can manage our actions related to this goal by reducing the per room installation cost of a digital room and by varying the number of rooms we install with the digital system in any given period 
our progress toward the goal of generating net free cash flow is set forth in the following table cash provided by operating activities cash used for investing activities difference the improvement from was driven by a increase in the level of cash generated by operating activities and a reduction in the cost to install a digital room  year over year  partially offset by an increase in the number of digital rooms 
these factors have resulted in a declining need for cash provided by external financing 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have required substantial amounts of capital to fund operations  expand our business and service existing indebtedness 
during  cash flow from operations was sufficient to cover all but million of capital investments including corporate capital  digital renewals and new room expansion 
in  cash flow from operations exceeded all corporate capital  digital renewals and new room expansion by million 
during  we installed or converted approximately  digital rooms versus  digital rooms in net cash provided by operating activities was million as compared to million in this resulted in cash flows net of investing of million for versus million in the prior year 
this represents an million and million improvement over and  respectively 
lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents on july   we completed a public offering of common stock registered pursuant to our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission in april in connection with the offering  we issued million shares at a price of per share 
in addition  on august   we issued  shares as a result of the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option 
the net proceeds from the offering including the over allotment were million after deducting underwriting and offering expenses of approximately million 
we used the net proceeds to repay million of our bank credit facility term loan and the remaining million of our senior notes 
the remaining proceeds of approximately million were retained as cash for use in general corporate purposes 
depending on the rate of growth in our business and other factors  we expect to incur capital expenditures of to million in based on expected capital expenditures  we estimate we will install between  and  net new rooms and convert between  and  existing rooms from tape based to digital systems in exchange for long term contract extensions in our principal sources of liquidity are our cash on hand  operating cash flow and our credit facility  which matures in we believe that our cash on hand  operating cash flow and borrowing available under the credit facility will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our future growth and financing obligations 
as of december   working capital was million  compared to negative million at december  due to an increased cash balance from the equity offering proceeds 
in order to continue to operate and expand our business  we must remain in compliance with covenants imposed by our credit facility and senior notes 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants  terms and conditions related to our credit facility and senior notes 
we are not aware of any events that qualify under the material adverse effect clause of the credit facility 
the total amount of long term debt outstanding  including that portion of debt classified as current  as of december  was million versus million as of december  in june  we amended our existing bank credit facility 
the amendment  among other things  modified the covenants for maximum consolidated total leverage ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio 
the allowable maximum consolidated total leverage ratio increased from to until the end of the fourth quarter and the increase in the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio  from to  was deferred from the third quarter until the first quarter our leverage and interest coverage ratios were as follows for the years ended december actual consolidated total leverage ratio maximum per covenant actual senior secured leverage ratio maximum per covenant actual consolidated interest coverage ratio minimum per covenant our maximum consolidated leverage ratio is a function of total indebtedness divided by operating income exclusive of depreciation and amortization and other miscellaneous non recurring items as defined by the covenant 
lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents our maximum senior secured leverage ratio is a function of total indebtedness less total unsecured indebtedness  divided by operating income exclusive of depreciation and amortization and other miscellaneous non recurring items as defined by the covenant 
our minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio is a function of operating income exclusive of depreciation and amortization and other miscellaneous non recurring items divided by interest expense as defined by the covenant 
maximum consolidated total leverage ratio  maximum senior secured leverage ratio  and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratios are not based on generally accepted accounting principles and are not presented as alternative measures of operating performance or liquidity 
they are presented here to demonstrate compliance with the covenants in our credit facility  as noncompliance with such covenants could have a material adverse effect on us 
we do not utilize special purpose entities or off balance sheet financial arrangements 
certain of our future debt covenant ratio changes are as follows q q q q maximum consolidated total leverage ratio maximum senior secured leverage ratio minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio in january  we amended the existing libor margin under our existing credit facility to be libor plus a margin of 
in april  we amended our existing credit facility again to establish  for term loans that are libor based loans  the libor pricing at libor plus an applicable libor margin of and  as long as our senior secured debt ratings are not less than bb from standard and poor s and ba from moody s  the applicable libor margin is 
as of december  our senior secured debt rating from standard and poor s was b and our rating from moody s was b as a result of refinancing of our notes  we also extended the maturity dates of the term loan and the revolver loan under our credit facility  without the payment of any additional costs  expenses or fees  from june to august and august  respectively 
in june  we issued million  principal amount of unsecured senior subordinated notes the notes  due june  the proceeds of the notes  which were issued at par  after underwriter fees and offering expenses  were approximately million 
approximately million of such proceeds were used to redeem the outstanding principal amount of the senior notes  pay accrued interest  pay call premiums  and pay related fees 
approximately million of the proceeds were used to reduce outstanding amounts under our credit facility 
the remaining proceeds of approximately million were for use in funding general corporate purposes 
the notes are unsecured  are subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt and rank pari passu in right of payment with any future senior subordinated indebtedness 
the notes require semi annual interest payments and contain covenants which restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  pay dividends or make certain distributions in respect to our common stock  redeem capital stock  issue or sell stock of subsidiaries in certain circumstances  effect certain business combinations and effect certain transactions with affiliates or stockholders 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants  terms  and conditions of the notes 
the notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  on or after june   initially at of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest declining ratably to of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on or after june  at any time prior to june   we may redeem lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents up to of the aggregate principal amount at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest with the cash proceeds of certain equity offerings 
in december  we issued million of unsecured senior notes the notes  due december  in june  we redeemed approximately of our outstanding notes at of their principal amount  with the balance of the outstanding notes redeemed in july at of their principal amount  as part of our refinancing in which the notes were issued 
obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than over total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt s interest on fixed rate debt other long term obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations payments due by period less than over total year years years years other commercial commitments standby letters of credit other long term obligations include future minimum operating lease payments and payments to hilton hotels corporation for the acquired rights to provide internet on television access and television on demand programming services to participating hotels and the right to independently pursue and further develop interactive television content 
seasonality our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation depending upon hotel occupancy rates and other factors 
our hotel customers typically experience higher occupancy rates during the second and third quarters due to seasonal travel patterns and  accordingly  we historically have higher revenue in those quarters 
however  quarterly revenue can be affected by the availability of popular content during those quarters and by commercial televised events such as the olympics  among other things 
we have no control over when new movies are released  how popular they will be or the popularity of other televised events 
business risks we continue to incur significant losses 
if we cannot become profitable or generate sustained levels of net free cash flow  which we define as having cash provided by operating activities exceeding cash used for investing  it could have a harmful effect on our results of operations  business and the value of our common stock 
we experienced net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur net losses 
if we do not become profitable or generate sustained levels of net free cash flow  which we define as having cash provided by operating activities exceeding cash used for investing activities  or if we become but do not remain profitable  it could have a harmful effect on our business and the value of our common stock 
lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents we operate in a very competitive business environment and competition could reduce our revenue and our cash flow 
we operate in the hotel in room entertainment business  which is highly competitive 
if we are unable to compete effectively with large diversified entertainment service providers that have substantially greater resources than we have  our operating margins and market share could be reduced  and the growth of our business inhibited 
in particular  we compete directly for customers with a variety of other interactive service providers  including other interactive television service providers  cable television companies  direct broadcast satellite companies  television networks and programmers  internet service providers and portals  companies offering web sites that provide on demand movies  rental companies that provide videocassettes and dvds that can be viewed in properly equipped hotel rooms or on other portable viewing devices  and hotels that offer in room laptops with internet access or other types of internet access systems 
we also compete  in varying degrees  with other leisure time activities such as movie theaters  the internet  radio  print media  personal computers and other alternative sources of entertainment and information 
in addition  future technological developments may affect competition within this business 
a continuing trend toward business combinations and alliances in both domestic and foreign entertainment service industry may create significant new competitors for us 
many of these combined entities could have resources far greater than ours 
these combined entities may provide bundled packages of programming  delivery and other services that compete directly with the products we offer 
our competitors may also offer services sooner and at more competitive rates than we do 
we may need to reduce our prices or license additional programming to remain competitive  and we may be unable to sustain future price levels as competition increases 
our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our offered services at desired pricing levels could impair our ability to achieve net free cash flow  which would harm our business 
due to the capital commitment required to install our system equipment  it generally has not been cost effective for us to install our system at hotels with fewer than guest rooms or low occupancy rates or low average room rates 
our competitors who have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do may develop a technology that is more cost effective than ours 
as a result  our competitors may be in a better position than we are to increase market share in the lodging industry and could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers 
our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the lodging industry s performance 
our results are closely connected to the performance of the lodging industry  where occupancy rates may fluctuate resulting from various factors 
reduction in hotel occupancy resulting from business  economic  or other events  such as significant international crises  acts of terrorism  war or public health issues  could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the overall travel industry can be  and has been in the past  adversely affected by weaker general economic climates  geopolitical instability and concerns about public health 
any future terrorist attack or credible threat of an attack is also likely to adversely affect the travel industry  including lodging occupancy rates 
for example  lodging occupancy rates fell significantly after the events of september  any reduction in occupancy rates  particularly if extended over a long period of time  will reduce our revenue opportunities  which would have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
to help mitigate the impact of reductions in industry occupancy rates on our financial conditions and results of operations  we continue to control expenses and capital spending 
we plan to reassess our operating and capital expenditure plans periodically to respond to changes in the economic environment 
additionally  our room base is geographically diversified  with more than two thirds of properties served being in highway or suburban locations 
less than of the room base is concentrated in each of the top ten urban areas of the united states 
by serving a wide variety of geographically dispersed properties  we mitigate reliance on any one geographic sector 
new technologies  including the expansion of digital distribution of content in our markets  may increase competition and result in a decrease in our revenue 
our success depends on new product development 
the entertainment and communications industry is ever changing as new technologies are introduced 
technological advances may result in an adverse competitive situation for us 
while we mitigate risks by continually designing  engineering  and developing products and systems that can be upgraded to support new services or integrated with new technologies as they become economically viable  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in these efforts 
the advent of digital technology  including the introduction of high definition television hdtv  is likely to accelerate the convergence of broadcast  telecommunications  internet and other media and lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents could result in material changes in the economics  regulations  intellectual property usage and technical platforms on which our business relies 
these changes could lower cost barriers for our competitors desiring to enter into  or expand their presence in  the television based interactive services business 
increased competition may adversely affect the scale  source and volatility of our revenue streams  cost structures and cash flow  and may require us to significantly change our operations 
there is a risk that our business and prospects will be harmed by these changes or that we will not identify or adapt to them as quickly as our competitors 
in addition  we may experience difficulties and delays in developing new products and systems or in integrating our system with new technologies 
we may have to incur significant capital expenditures in order to adapt to technological changes 
our failure to develop new products and product enhancements could harm our business and prospects 
we have a continuing product development program designed to develop new products and to enhance and improve existing products 
the successful development of products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks  both known and unknown  including unanticipated delays  access to capital  budget overruns  and technical problems 
these difficulties could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design  development and commercialization of these new products or product enhancements 
given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction  we cannot assure that any given product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis  within budget  or at all 
our failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget could harm our business and prospects 
we may have to incur significant capital expenditures in order to adapt to technological change 
the television based interactive service industry has been  and is likely to continue to be subject to rapid and significant technological change  including continuing developments in technology that do not presently have widely accepted standards  and frequent introductions of new services and alternative technologies  including new technologies for providing high definition television and providing internet content 
we expect that new technologies will emerge that may be superior to  or may not be compatible with some of our current technologies  which may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remain competitive 
in particular  we may have to incur capital expenditures to support digital or high definition television platforms in our hotel properties 
many of our competitors  including cable and internet service providers  may have greater financial and technical resources to adapt to and capitalize on any such technological changes more effectively than we can 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and to offer  on a timely basis  services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards 
in part  we rely on third parties for the development of  and access to  communications and network technology 
as a result  we may be unable to obtain access to new technology on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms 
if we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence  or fail to obtain access to important technologies  our revenues and business could be harmed 
our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets  patents  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our technology 
despite these precautions  unauthorized third parties may infringe  copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology 
we do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued within the scope of claims sought  if at all  or whether any patent issued will be challenged or invalidated 
in addition  we have applied or plan to apply for corresponding patents and patent applications in several foreign countries for some of our existing patents and patent applications 
there is a risk that these patent applications will not provide significant protection for our products and technology 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology that our patents do not cover 
in addition  lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents because patent applications in the united states can provide patent protection from the date of filing but are not publicly disclosed until months after the patent application has been filed  other patent applications may have been filed in those previous months which relate to our technology and of which we are unaware 
moreover  there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual rights to the same extent as united states intellectual property laws 
in the absence of significant patent protection  we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products  processes or technology  which could harm our business 
if our products or services employ technology that infringes the proprietary rights of others  we may be subject to infringement claims  forced to pay certain fees to license technology or be required to stop selling our products 
our business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
we have been notified in the past and may be in the future that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties 
if any such claims are asserted  we may seek to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
there is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms  precluding our use of the applicable technology 
alternatively  we may decide to litigate such claims or to design around the patented technology 
these actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
a successful claim of infringement against us or our failure or inability to license infringed or similar technology could damage our business to the extent we are required to pay substantial monetary damages or if  as a result of a successful claim  we are unable to sell our products or services without redeveloping them or are otherwise forced to incur significant additional expense 
as a result  any infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers resulting form infringement claims  whether or not proven to be true  may harm our business and prospects 
acquisitions of companies or technologies may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert management attention 
while we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that we believe could  among other things  complement or expand our business or otherwise offer growth opportunities  acquisitions could create risk for us  including difficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel  operations  technologies or products  which may adversely affect our ability to develop new products and services and to compete in our rapidly changing marketplace 
any acquisition may not generate any additional revenue or provide any benefit to our business 
in addition  we do not have significant experience in acquiring and integrating companies  which could impair our ability to make successful acquisitions 
if our third party suppliers fail to provide us with key components and services on a timely basis  our cost could increase and our growth could be hindered 
we currently rely on third parties to supply key components and services  which are available only from a limited number of suppliers  for the manufacture and assembly of our interactive systems 
we have occasionally experienced delays and other problems in receiving the components and services and may  in the future  be unable to obtain such components and services on the scale and within the time frames required by us on terms we find acceptable  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain  or if we experience a delay in the delivery of  such components or services  we may be forced to incur significant unanticipated costs to secure alternative third party suppliers or adjust our operations 
additionally  certain electronic components parts used within our system can be subject to temporary shortages because of general economic conditions 
the occurrence of any of these events could increase our costs  hinder our growth and adversely affect our business and prospects 
we are dependent on others for our programming content and increases in our costs or license fees to obtain such programming could reduce our cash flow and profitability 
our guest room programming content is provided primarily by movie studios  major television networks and other providers  aggregators and distributors of entertainment content 
we currently pay each of these parties a fee for the right to distribute their programming in our installed guest rooms 
in the future  we may be exposed to volatile or increased programming costs that may adversely affect our operating results 
our entertainment content providers may demand higher royalty rates or higher minimum payments than we are currently paying or may defer making their content available to us 
we do not have a formal agreement with some of our content providers and  therefore  content from these providers may not be available in the future on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
increased licensing fees would also negatively impact our operating results 
our revenue may be adversely affected by a reduction or elimination of the time between our receipt of movies and the movies being made available to the home market 
we receive our movies directly from movie studios and the timing is at the studios discretion 
historically  we have received movies prior to their being more broadly distributed via movie rental or retail stores 
the window of release has yielded a competitive advantage  as hotel guests have been lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents able to view movies in the hotel rooms prior to being able to rent or purchase them for home viewing 
recently  this advance window of release has been shrinking 
a further reduction or elimination of this advance window of release could adversely affect our revenue 
in addition  if a studio delays release of a movie to us in a manner inconsistent with past practices  we may not be able to generate as much revenue from such movie as we could have with an earlier release date 
the lack of quality programming or a change in available content could reduce our profitability and cash flows 
our profitability and cash flow is dependent on our ability to provide quality and popular programming to our hotel guests 
we currently provide hotel guests major movies that we obtain from movie studios 
the quality and popularity of major movies available at any given time and from year to year can vary widely 
generally  the more popular titles at the box office will also be more popular with hotel guests 
we also provide hotel guests independent films most of which are non rated and intended for mature audiences  music services and nintendo video games 
our ability to be profitable and generate positive cash flow depends upon our ability to provide content for which hotel guests are willing to pay 
however  we cannot predict the future popularity or quality of the movies  music  games or other content that we provide or may provide in the future 
if  for any reason  such content became less popular than it is currently  or is not made available to us for distribution on a timely basis  our business could be adversely impacted 
in addition  if any significant portion of the content we provide to hotel guests were to become unavailable  for reasons that could include licensing difficulties  governmental regulation or issues of public standards  our business could be adversely impacted 
in addition  any negative publicity  lawsuit  or boycotts by opponents of the mature themed programming content could have a negative impact on the willingness for the lodging industry generally to offer such content to guests which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and ability to achieve stated business goals 
federal  state  local and foreign legislation and regulation may negatively impact our business and growth 
we may be classified as a multi channel video programming distributor  and thus may be subject to various provisions of the communications act of  as amended by the cable communications policy act of  the cable television consumer protection and competition act of and the telecommunications act of  and the regulations promulgated under those acts 
in addition  the internet based services offered by us may be affected by various laws and governmental regulations 
while there are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access to or commerce on commercial online services  new laws and regulations are under debate by federal and local lawmakers and may be adopted 
the adoption of such laws or regulations in the future may slow the growth of commercial online services and the internet  which may cause a decline for our internet based services and products or have other adverse effects on our business 
in addition  any legislative or regulatory changes restricting content that may be delivered over our systems  particularly mature content  could significantly reduce our revenue and operating income 
federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations are  or may be  the subject of a variety of judicial  administrative and legislative hearings and proceedings that could change  in varying degrees  the regulatory classification applicable to us and the manner in which we are regulated 
we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or the impact on our operations at this time 
if our hotel customers become dissatisfied with our service  they may elect not to renew or to terminate service agreements with us and  in that event  our ability to maintain or grow our revenue would be adversely affected 
in the event our customers become dissatisfied with the scope or capability of our products or services  they may elect not to renew our service agreements upon expiration or  in certain instances  terminate their existing agreements with us for failure to perform under the terms of their existing contracts 
the loss of a hotel chain customer  any group of customers  or the loss of a significant number of hotels could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
however  we believe that our interactive hotel base is well diversified in terms of i location  ii demographics  and iii customer contracts 
we rely on our diverse hotel base and geographic diversity to mitigate these exposures  as well as the fact that our services are provided under long term contracts 
nevertheless  our success depends on maintaining good relationships with the clients and property owners we serve 
our revenue is affected by seasonality and dependent on other factors beyond our control 
our revenue is dependent on the timely availability of content  including popular major motion pictures  the occupancy rate of each hotel property served  the percentage of occupied rooms that buy movies or other services at the property  and the price of the services 
occupancy rates vary based on the property s location  its competitive position with the marketplace  seasonal factors  general economic conditions  changes in travel patterns due to public health concerns  lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents the threat of terrorism  wars and other international crises  and other factors outside of our control 
occupancy rates are usually higher during the summer and lower during winter 
the percentage of occupied rooms that buy movies or other services at the property generally reflects the hotel s guest mix profile  the popularity and seasonality of movies and other services available at the hotel and the guests other entertainment alternatives 
the percentage of occupied rooms that buy movies and other services at the property also varies over time with general economic conditions 
our results are closely related to the performance of the lodging industry 
because many factors described above are out of our control  we may not be able to control negative trends in our revenue 
opportunities to expand our installed customer room base may be limited  so we may be unable to grow our revenue 
due to the capital commitment required to install our system equipment  we may choose not to offer our services to some un served hotels  because we expect these hotels to generate an insufficient return on our investment 
further  while new hotel construction and hotel expansions offer an opportunity to expand our customer base  increases in un served rooms due to the addition of new hotel rooms in any given year would be incremental 
accordingly  in order to grow revenue significantly  we must be successful in broadening the range of services provided to customers and securing contracts to serve both new hotel rooms and hotels that are currently served by competitors 
however  if our cash management strategy calls for us to conserve available resources  we may choose not to make capital or other expenditures  which would adversely affect growth 
even if we are willing to make such expenditures  we may not be successful in our efforts to further expand our installed customer room base 
we may not have adequate capital resources to carry out our business plan  which could have a harmful effect on our business and prospects 
we may have insufficient capital resources to carry out our business plan if our capital expenditure or working capital requirements increase  whether as a result of product development efforts  changes in technology or otherwise  and we are unable to access financing on acceptable terms 
this would have the following adverse impacts on our business and prospects  among others we may be required to delay or be unable to make the capital expenditures necessary to expand or maintain our customer base or to continue to deploy our digital systems and other technological advances throughout our installed room base  we may have insufficient capital to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness as they become due  we may have to delay or limit our product development activities  and we may be required to seek additional capital through additional equity or debt financings  asset sales  collaborative arrangements or other sources  which may not be available to us on a timely basis  if at all  or may not be available on acceptable terms 
we have substantial debt and significant interest payment requirements 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding 
subject to restrictions on our credit facility and instruments governing our debt securities  we may also incur significant amounts of additional debt for working capital  capital expenditures and other purposes 
our high level of debt could have significant consequences on our business  including the following we may have difficulty borrowing money for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes  we will need to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay interest on borrowings under our credit facility and other debt instruments  which will reduce the amount of money available to fund operations  capital expenditures and other activities  some of our debt has a variable rate of interest  which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates  we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse development in our business  we may not have the flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions  including increased competition and demand for new products and services  and our various debt instruments contain cross default provisions  if we default under any of these instruments  such default could constitute a default under our other debt instruments and may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness 
covenant restrictions under our credit facility and instruments governing our debt securities may limit our ability to operate our business 
our credit facility and the instruments governing our debt securities contain covenants that may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents activities 
future borrowing instruments  such as credit facilities and indentures  if any  are also likely to contain restrictive covenants and may require us to pledge assets as security under those future arrangements 
the terms of our credit facility and debt securities restrict  among other things  our ability and the ability of our subsidiary to borrow money  pay dividends or make distributions  purchase or redeem stock  repay subordinated indebtedness before its stated maturity date  make investments and extend credit  engage in transactions with affiliates  engage in sale leaseback transactions  consummate certain asset sales  effect a consolidation or merger  or sell  transfer  lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  and create liens on our assets 
in addition  the indenture for our notes and credit facility and other material agreements require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests that may require us to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
our credit facility also includes a covenant that would result in an event of default if we suffer a material adverse effect as defined in the credit facility 
events beyond our control  including changes in general economic and business conditions  may affect our ability to meet those financial ratios and financial conditions tests and to otherwise remain in compliance with the requirements of our credit facility  other debt instruments and other material agreements 
a breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under the applicable debt instrument or agreement 
in that event  the amounts under the applicable agreement could be declared immediately due and payable  and such a default may cause a default under and or an acceleration of our other outstanding indebtedness and some of our material agreements 
as a result of these covenants and restrictions  we are limited in how to conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt  compete effectively or take advantage of new business opportunities 
our ability to generate sufficient cash to service outstanding indebtedness or fund capital requirements depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on or to refinance outstanding indebtedness or to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
to some extent  this is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future borrowings under existing and future credit arrangements in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity  or sell assets 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash to service or refinance any of our indebtedness  it may have a material adverse affect on our business and financial condition 
our data systems could fail or their security could be compromised 
our business operations depend on the reliability of sophisticated data systems 
any failure of these systems  or any breach of our systems security measures  could adversely affect our operations  at least until our data can be reloaded and or the breaches remediated

our primary cost drivers are predetermined rates  such as hotel commissions  license fees paid for major motion pictures and other content  or one time fixed fees for independent films 
however  the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based upon the available information 
the following critical policies relate to the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of interactive television services in the period the related services are sold to the hotel or guest and collection is reasonably assured 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists through our long term contract with each hotel 
no future performance obligations exist on a lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents service that has been provided 
the prices related to our products or services are fixed or determinable prior to delivery of the products or services 
revenue from the sale of system equipment and service parts and labor is recognized when the equipment is delivered or the service has been provided 
we also have advance billings from one month to three months for certain free to guest programming services where the revenue is deferred and recognized in the periods that services are provided 
we provide high speed internet access through the sale and installation of equipment to subscribing hotels 
revenue from the sale and installation of this equipment is recognized when the equipment is installed or the service has been provided 
we receive monthly service fees from such hotels for technical maintenance and call center support services following the initial installation 
the monthly service fees are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract 
we also provide our interactive television infrastructure and content to the healthcare industry 
under a relationship with a healthcare services provider  we sell our interactive system and provide recurring support for interactive content  software maintenance and technical field service for a fixed monthly fee 
revenue from the sale and installation of our interactive system is recognized when the equipment is installed or the service has been provided 
the fixed monthly fees are recognized ratably over the term of the related contracts 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considering several factors  including historical experience  aging of the accounts receivable  and contract terms between the hotel and us 
in accordance with our hotel contracts  monies collected by the hotel for interactive television services are held in trust on our behalf 
collectibility is reasonably assured as supported by our credit check process and nominal write off history 
if the financial condition of a hotel chain or group of hotels were to deteriorate and reduce the ability to remit our monies  we may be required to increase our allowance by recording additional bad debt expense 
allowance for excess or obsolete system components 
we regularly evaluate component levels to ascertain build requirements based on our backlog and service requirements based on our current installed base 
when a certain system component becomes obsolete due to technological changes and it is determined that the component cannot be utilized within our current installed base  we record a provision for excess and obsolete component inventory based on estimated forecasts of product demand and service requirements 
we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of service requirements and future production  however any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological advances could have an impact on the value of system components and reported operating results 
property and equipment 
our property and equipment is stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
installed guest pay and free to guest systems consist of equipment and related costs of installation  including certain payroll costs  sales commissions and customer acquisition costs 
maintenance costs  which do not significantly extend the useful lives of the respective assets  and repair costs are charged to guest pay operations as incurred 
we begin depreciating guest pay and free to guest systems when such systems are installed and activated 
depreciation of other equipment begins when such equipment is placed in service 
we attribute no salvage value to equipment  and depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the following useful lives years buildings guest pay systems installed system costs customer acquisition costs system components software costs other equipment allowance for system removal 
we de install properties through the course of normal operations due to a number of factors  including poor revenue performance  hotel bankruptcy or collection issues  hotel closings  and lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents change in service provider

recent accounting developments in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
this statement amends apb opinion no 
and is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning june  the adoption of this statement  effective july   will have no effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
further  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions in sfas are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this statement  effective january   will not have a significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
public entities will be required to apply statement r as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of this statement 
we believe the adoption of this statement  effective july   will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities and issued a revised interpretation in december fin r 
fin r requires that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities  and results of the activities of the variable interest entity must be included in the consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise 
fin r must be applied for periods ending after march   and was effective immediately for all variable interest entities created after january  we do not have ownership in any variable interest entities and the adoption of fin r had no impact on our financial condition or results of operations in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including potential losses resulting from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest 
at december   we had debt totaling million 
we have interest rate swap arrangements covering debt with a notional amount of million to effectively change the underlying debt from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate for the term of the swap agreements 
after giving effect to the interest rate swap arrangements  we had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million at december  for fixed rate debt  interest rate fluctuations affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  interest rate fluctuations generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
assuming other variables remain constant such as debt levels  a one percentage point increase to interest rates would decrease the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by an estimated million 
the impact on earnings and cash flow for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase to interest rates would be approximately  assuming other variables remain constant
