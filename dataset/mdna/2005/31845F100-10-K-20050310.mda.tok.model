critical accounting policies and estimates first advantage s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon its audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

com from june the company s operating results for the year ended december  include results for the fast division only 
first advantage believes the following are the more critical accounting policies that impact its financial statements  some of which are based on management s best estimates available at the time of preparation 
other accounting policies also have a significant effect on first advantage s consolidated financial statements  and some of these policies also require the use of estimates and assumptions 
although first advantage believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time of delivery of the reports  as first advantage has no ongoing obligation after delivery 
revenue from investigative services is recognized as services are performed 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company includes reimbursed government fees in revenue and in cost of service 
allowance for uncollectible receivables the allowance for all probable uncollectible receivables is based on a combination of historical data  cash payment trends  specific customer issues  write off trends  general economic conditions and other factors 
these factors are continuously monitored by management to arrive at an estimate for the amount of accounts receivable that may ultimately be uncollectible 
in circumstances where first advantage is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  first advantage records a specific allowance for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected

direct costs incurred in the development of software are capitalized once the preliminary project stage is completed  management has committed to funding the project and completion and use of the software for its intended purpose are probable 
first advantage ceases capitalization of development costs once the software has been substantially completed at date of conversion and is ready for its intended use 
database development costs database development costs represent expenditures associated with first advantage s databases of information for customer usage 
the costs are capitalized from the time technological feasibility is established until the information is ready for use 
impairment of intangible and long lived assets first advantage carries intangible and long lived assets at cost less accumulated amortization where applicable 
accounting standards require that assets be written down if they become impaired 
intangible and long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable 
at such time that an impairment in value of an intangible or long lived asset is identified  the impairment will be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined by employing an expected present value technique  which utilizes multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect the range of possible outcomes and an appropriate discount rate 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company completed a goodwill impairment test  for the year ending december   for all reporting units 
a valuation date of september  was used for this impairment test and was performed by a third party 
the test determined that each reporting unit had a fair value in excess of carrying value  therefore  no goodwill impairment was recorded 
purchase accounting first advantage completed nine acquisitions in the company has acquired additional businesses in the purchase method of accounting requires companies to assign values to assets and liabilities acquired based upon their fair values 
in most instances  there is not a readily defined or listed market price for individual assets and liabilities acquired in connection with a business  including intangible assets 
the determination of fair value for assets and liabilities in many instances requires a high degree of estimation 
the valuation of intangibles assets  in particular  is very subjective 
first advantage generally uses internal cash flow models and  in certain instances  third party valuations in estimating fair values 
the use of different valuation techniques and assumptions can change the amounts and useful lives assigned to the assets and liabilities acquired  including goodwill and other intangible assets and related amortization expense 
amounts allocated to certain assets and liabilities as of december  are based on preliminary estimates of fair value and may be revised in the company does not anticipate that revisions to the amounts allocated to acquired assets and liabilities  if any  will be significant to the company s financial statements

r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions
