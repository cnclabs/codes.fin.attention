item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of many factors including those under the caption forward looking information 
overview our strategy for growth is operations based and market driven 
as a small participant in two large markets  commercial printing and folding cartons  our goal is to challenge other companies serving the industry by offering speed  variability and flexibility at prices that are competitive with those that pursue a business model based on long lead times and large production runs 
in the period covered by the discussion and analysis our operations have been significantly influenced by the activities generated by our supply agreements with vistaprint limited 
our financial position was influenced significantly by the spin off from astronics and a expansion program relating to our production capacity and infrastructure to accommodate our growth both realized and expected 
in  the company stepped up its expenditures on sales and marketing resources and activities for both its custom folding carton product line and to expand market channels for commercial printing beyond vistaprint 
these sales and marketing expenditures will continue into revenue compared to revenue increased in compared to for the year  revenue was million compared with million in  an increase of million 
commercial print on demand  which had net product sales of million for  accounted for million of this increase up from the level of million 
directly related to this product line is the amortization of the advance payment from vistaprint which provided an additional million of revenue in thus total revenue related to our commercial print business was million  nearly all of which was pursuant to our supply agreements with vistaprint limited 
during the first eight months of our contract with vistaprint provided revenue to us under a long term cost recovery approach the term of the agreement stretched to april and we billed to vistaprint our costs of the plant that was dedicated to their requirements plus a one third mark up 
on september  this arrangement changed to a more traditional customer vendor supply arrangement the definitive term of the agreement was changed to one year through august  and the pricing structure was changed to a units based approach 
in connection with this mod pac received an advance payment of million 
this advance payment is being amortized over months  the month definitive term of the current agreement and the month period for which a pricing framework is described in the current agreement relative to any subsequent agreements 
net sales of custom folding cartons were up million  or in to million from million in about of this increase came from new customers and about of the increase came from increased volume at existing customers 
net sales in mod pac s stock box product line experienced a increase of million to million from million in personalized print net sales realized a slight increase of million to million from million in compared to net sales were up in compared with for the year  net sales were million compared with million in  an increase of million 
commercial print on demand  which had net sales of million for  accounted for million of this increase 
this more than doubled the level of million 
these sales are all pursuant to the supply agreement with vistaprint limited  which was replaced in with the supply agreement that we currently operate under 
revenue under the agreement that governed our business with vistaprint in was calculated based on cost plus a one third mark up and was driven by the cost of production resources  such as equipment  personnel and factory infrastructure as well as material costs  such as paper  press plates and ink  dedicated to completing vistaprint s order flow 
in response to vistaprint s forecast for order flow  the company rapidly expanded the resources dedicated to the commercial print on demand business in the first half of  which in turn resulted in sharp consecutive quarter over quarter revenue growth 
in the second half of  we continued to add additional resources but at a slower pace than in the first half of  which was reflected in the second half s rate of revenue expansion for this product line 
net sales of custom folding cartons were up million  or  in to million from million in the increase was split between increased volume at existing accounts and the addition of new accounts 
net sales in mod pac s stock box product line experienced a slight increase of million to million from million in personalized print net sales grew almost  or million  to million from million in in we increased our internet marketing activities and broadened the product line 
cost of products sold as a percentage of revenues  cost of products sold were  and  for the years  and  respectively 
as an operating strategy we do not want to be capacity constrained 
we have been and are continuing to systematically build a superprint facility 
our objective is to do this while maintaining our gross and operating margins within historical ranges 
generally we were able to balance capacity increases with enough volume to offset the associated costs of production resources needed to increase capacity 
throughout the three year period  we have added additional capacity measured both in terms of equipment and production hours available 
during we had four high speed presses generally running two shifts a day 
in the first half of we added two high speed presses  by the second half of we were generally running three shifts a day 
in we added another high speed press and continued to increase the capabilities of our second and third shifts mainly through increased supervision and production support such as engineering  material handling  shipping and receiving 
our workforce at our main production facility our superprint facility more than doubled during this period of time and currently stands at throughout this period we added four digital presses  three high speed computer to plate lines and  in late  several post press machines 
this aggressive ramp up of capacity and associated costs has put upward pressure on our costs as it relates to revenue 
the decrease in cost of products sold in to of revenue from of revenue in is a result of the amortization into s revenue of million of the advanced payment from vistaprint  which provided a benefit to this ratio of of revenue offset by the costs associated with our increased capacity not recovered through volume increases amounting to of revenue and the affect on revenue of the change in our billing structure with vistaprint which was of revenue 
the increase in cost of products sold in to of revenue from of revenue in is a result of the costs associated with our increased capacity not recovered through volume increases selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative costs remained fairly consistent at in  in  and in expense allocations from astronics corporation in the first quarter and for the year are included in selling  general and administrative costs 
the majority of selling  general and administrative costs are related to salaries and benefits for sales and administrative personnel  which have increased due to additional headcount  salary adjustments and increased costs for benefits such as employee medical and dental 
in addition  both and were affected by the increased costs of being a separate public company  which were million in each year of revenue in and of revenue in 
in  sales expenses increased million or of revenue 
this increase is associated with expanding our sales and marketing effort and developing our commercial print product line 
interest expense interest expense was thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively  in and the expense includes thousand reclassified from other comprehensive income related to a cash flow hedge on the debt that was prepaid in otherwise  the increases in and are a result of borrowings to fund the company s capital program 
loss on disposal of assets the loss on sale of assets in of thousand results from the sale or disposal of mainly pre press equipment and components  which became redundant as a result of the company s implementation of more advanced technology 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was in  in and in the tax rate was lower than normal mainly due to a reduction in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to state tax credits 
net income net income in was million  an increase of million or over s net income of million 
this increase was mainly a result of the increase in revenue  which enabled us to widen operating margins and  a lower effective income tax rate 
net income in was million  an increase of million over this increase was a result of a million increase in operating income  due to the increase in revenue  offset by the increased interest expense  the loss on disposal of equipment and higher income taxes 
earnings per share earnings per share eps calculations prior to the spin off reflect the shares and options outstanding had the distribution occurred at the beginning of each period presented 
shares used for the basic shares outstanding prior to the distribution reflect the shares outstanding of astronics corporation factored by the distribution ratio 
the net effect of dilutive stock options prior to the distribution relates only to stock options held by employees of the company and the directors of astronics 
since the date of the distribution  the company s shares and dilutive stock options are used in the eps calculations 
the diluted earnings per share calculation for excludes  stock options that were anti dilutive at december  in the second quarter of  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock  which was approximately of the shares then outstanding 
these repurchases had a per share favorable effect on the basic and diluted eps calculation 
the diluted earnings per share calculation for excludes  stock options that were anti dilutive at december  although the company repurchased  shares of its common stock in   of the shares repurchased occurred in december and as a result  the repurchases did not affect the results of basic and diluted eps calculations 
liquidity in  cash provided by operating activities was million  million more than the million in this significant increase was mainly due to the million advance payment received from vistaprint supplemented by a reduction in working capital components 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million in  a decrease of million  because increased net income and non cash items such as depreciation and deferred income taxes were offset by increased requirements for working capital components 
capital expenditures in were million compared with million in and million in most of these expenditures are related to additional production equipment and  to a lesser extent  additional production facilities 
during the three year period ended december   we increased our high speed press capacity by with the addition of three large format presses 
in connection with these presses we invested substantially in pre press and post press equipment 
we also added four production lines based on leading edge digital press technology 
we expanded production  warehouse and office space at both of our production facilities in western new york 
at our main production facility we installed a megawatt power plant that will ensure source and stability of power to operate our production equipment 
although the company s expansion plans are ongoing it expects to contain capital expenditures to approximately million in the company acquired temporary investments in of million with its extra cash million of this will be used in to pay income taxes above our regular requirements as all of the income taxes associated with the advanced payment from vistaprint will be paid in we paid a million dividend to astronics at december  in connection with our spin off from astronics 
preceding the spin off we closed on a million term loan facility in february  and subsequently  we paid all amounts due astronics 
in addition to the term loan facility  we have a line of credit available from a commercial bank for million 
although we used the line of credit during and  there were no amounts outstanding on the line at december  and the term loan was  prepaid in september with a portion of the advanced payment from vistaprint 
the line of credit is unsecured  and amounts outstanding  if any  bear interest generally based on libor or the bank s prime rate  at the company s option 
during and  the company expended million and million for the repurchase of a total of  shares 
the company has an outstanding authorization from its board to repurchase  shares at december  the closing price of the company s common stock as of december  was 
at this price the repurchase  shares would require at december   outstanding irrevocable letters of credit were we believe that cash on hand of million at december   temporary investments of million  cash flow from operations  and the million available on the line of credit are sufficient to meet our cash requirements for operations  income tax payments  capital expenditures  common stock redemptions and debt service for contractual obligations payments due by period s omitted contractual obligation total after long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases deferred compensation total off balance sheet arrangements the only off balance sheet arrangements the company has are operating leases for production equipment 
rental expense under these non cancelable leases was  in   in and  in minimum future rental payments under non cancelable operating lease obligations as of december  are           and thereafter   the company has the right to purchase the leased equipment for the fair market value at the end of the lease 
relationship with vistaprint limited the company performed printing and order fulfillment services for vistaprint limited  resulting in revenue of  in   in and  in vistaprint limited owed mod pac corp 
 and  at december  and  respectively  related to such services

keane  is a shareholder in and chief executive officer of vistaprint limited 
in addition  kevin t 
keane is a shareholder in vistaprint limited  holding less than of its capital stock 
the revenue attributable to vistaprint includes  of amortization of the million advanced payment received on september  in connection with the new supply agreement 
the company has a supply agreement with vistaprint limited pursuant to which the company is vistaprint limited s exclusive north american supplier of printed products through august  this agreement  which replaced an agreement that extended to and whereby mod pac charged vistaprint on a cost plus one third mark up bases  sets prices on a unit bases and provides a framework for pricing products covered by any renewals or extensions through august the unit prices were arrived at by reference to mod pac s fully burdened costs for products subject to the agreement plus a mark up 
the million advanced payment was arrived at by negotiation between the two company s and was mainly associated with providing mod pac cost recovery and profit on the production resources developed or acquired which were dedicated to the fulfillment of vistaprint s business in north america 
as of september  the company had assets with a carrying value of million and over one hundred employees dedicated to the vistaprint fulfillment contract 
trends and uncertainties a significant development for the company in recent years  has been the growth of its commercial print product line revenues through its arrangements with vistaprint limited  which comprised of the company s revenues in the company expects  that after the expiration of the current supply agreement with vistaprint at the end of august  it will no longer be vistaprint s exclusive north american supplier 
vistaprint has announced its intention to build a production facility in windsor  ontario  canada 
although the company expects to continue to print and fulfill commercial printing orders from vistaprint after august the amount of business  if any  will depend on whether a the company and vistaprint agree to a subsequent supply agreement and b vistaprint s needs which will be impacted by how quickly vistaprint brings on production and fulfillment capacity in canada and demand from its customers for its products 
market risks as a result of short cycle times  the company does not have any long term commitments to purchase production raw materials or sell products that would present significant risks due to price fluctuations 
raw paper stock is available to us from multiple domestic sources  as a result  we believe the risk of supply interruptions due to such things as strikes at the source of supply or to logistics systems is limited 
risks due to fluctuation in interest rates are not material to the company at december  because of no exposure to floating rate debt and limited market risk on its  of temporary investments because interest is reset to market rates every days 
since may of  over of the company s power needs are met through natural gas 
the company has investigated supply contracts of various lengths  currently it has no supply arrangements for fixed prices 
historically  the price of natural gas has fluctuated widely 
in the past months natural gas prices have been as low as per decatherm and as high as  and is currently trading around per decatherm for march gas 
a one dollar per decatherm change in the price of natural gas would affect the company s annual net income by  although the company is concerned about cost and has from time to time acquired contracts for natural gas its main concern is availability 
the company monitors the availability of natural gas  considering such factors as amount in storage  gas production data and transportation data  so that it can take appropriate action if concerns about availability occur 
the company has investigated and tested a back up power source in the form of a rented transportable diesel powered generator 
although such generators are generally available the company cannot be assured that a generator adequate to meet the company s needs will be available if and when such need should arise 
we have no foreign operations  nor do we transact any business in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we have no foreign currency market risks 
the only change in market risks to the company from to was the elimination in of the exposure to floating rate debt because of the retirement of all such debt in september of recently issued accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july   which is when we expect to adopt it 
as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  no amounts of operating cash flows were recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
in developing such estimates  management evaluates the facts known to it at the time and applies such facts within the framework of certain critical accounting policies that govern valuation allowances of the company s assets 
these policies include determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to doubtful accounts receivable  lower of cost or market reserves related to the company s inventories  depreciation allowances and impairment reserves with respect to the company s long lived assets and valuation allowances with respect to the realizability of deferred tax assets 
often  management must make certain assumptions about the future when applying these policies 
management uses past experience in developing such assumptions about the future 
actual experience will be different than the assumptions made and the differences could result in material adjustments to management s estimates 
specifically and with respect to deferred tax assets  the company had gross deferred tax assets at december  of million  which include million related to new york state investment tax credits 
these credits are subject to certain statutory provisions  such as the length of available carry forward period and minimum tax  which reduces the probability of realization of the full value of such credits 
management estimates the amount of credits the company is likely to realize in the future based on actual historical realization rates and the statutory carry forward period 
as a result of the analysis performed as of december   management adjusted the valuation allowance for these credits to million 
due to the company s rate of capital expenditures  annual amounts of tax credits generated have generally exceeded its annual utilization rate of such credits 
as long as this trend continues  management likely will make annual additions to the reserve 
changes in the new york state tax law or the tax status of the company s operations in new york state would require adjustments to the reserve 
most of the remaining million of deferred tax assets relates primarily to the difference in the timing of the recognition of the million vistaprint advanced payment for financial statement purposes versus income tax return reporting 
this deferred tax asset is considered by management to be realizable because of the predictability of the future taxable income from this advanced payment

accordingly  we have no foreign currency market risks 
the market risk that the company was exposed to at december  were generally the same as described above except that the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on floating rate debt has been eliminated because the company paid off all such debt in
