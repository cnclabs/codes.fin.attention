during  we continued to take actions which we believe will strengthen the performance of our core businesses 
in banking  we opened our golden valley  minnesota branch office and completed our acquisition of a mortgage banking operation 
in insurance  we increased the volume of insurance commission income and made acquisitions in several different market areas 
we believe that we have achieved our goal of building a diversified business base  which has long been a cornerstone of our strategy 
we believe each of our core businesses is well defined and well positioned to serve the needs of our customers  while contributing to our long term corporate financial performance and share value creation 
looking forward to  we hope to continue to derive benefits from our investments in expanding our banking and insurance operations  and implementing programs to encourage cross selling across all of our business lines 
results of operations net interest income 
net interest income  the difference between total interest income earned on interest earning assets and total interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities  is the banking segment s primary source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of earning assets  the level of rates earned on those assets  the volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and the level of rates paid on those liabilities 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain information relating to our average balance sheet and reflects the yield on average assets and cost of average liabilities 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income and expense by the average balance of assets and liabilities 
all average balances have been derived from monthly averages  which are indicative of daily averages

without these interest income variances and derivative transactions  net interest margin for the and periods would have been percent and percent  respectively 
the remaining fair value of our interest rate cap contracts on december  was  therefore  net interest income in future periods can only be negatively affected to that amount if the fair value of the contracts were required to be written to if the fair value of the derivative contracts were to be increased in future periods due to increases in three month libor the rate upon which our current cap contracts are based  this would have a favorable effect on net interest income in those future periods as favorable adjustments to the fair value of the contracts would be reflected as reduced interest expense 
the following condensed information summarizes the major factors combining to create the changes to net interest income  spread and margin during as compared to lettered explanations following the summary describe causes of the changes in these major factors

a average loans held for sale increased due to mortgage loan and student loan financing programs initiated during b although period end investments available for sale decreased million between december  and december   average investments for the month period ended december  increased million 
total investments at december  were million 
outstanding investments were increased to million at march  to replace a reduction in loans held for investment that occurred due to general planned loan payoffs of approximately million  general pay downs on revolving lines of credit of approximately million and the payoff of a million loan that was on nonaccrual status at december  investments available for sale ended june  at million and september  at million 
over million of investments available for sale were sold during september and the proceeds were used to fund other earning assets  particularly mortgage loans and student loans held for sale 
c average loans held for investment during declined despite an increase in period end loans between december  and december  loans held for investment declined in early to a low of million at march  but finished out the year with increases ending at million at december  average loans held for investment were as low as million in april compared with million in december d our increased loan yield reflects the federal reserve interest rate increases during the daily average prime rate in was percent as compared to percent for the higher prime rate caused floating rate loans to reprice at higher rates and new loans  which  as discussed above  came on primarily in the second half of  to be originated at higher interest rate levels 
e the increased yield on investments reflects the higher interest rate environment during combined with the lower levels of prepayments on mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations relative to during  lower premium amortization million versus million in helped generate higher yields in the investment portfolio 
f the decrease in cost of interest bearing deposits reflects our efforts to contain deposit costs during a rising rate environment in the decrease also reflects a full year of benefit of rate decreases at the end of additionally  during  new certificates of deposit and repricing certificates of deposit priced at lower rates that then reduced the cost of deposits going forward into g the decrease in cost of borrowings was primarily a result of a decrease in the average cost of fhlb borrowings 
million of fhlb advances priced at a weighted average rate of matured during h the increase in average borrowings is primarily attributable to higher use of federal funds purchased and the million increase in our long term borrowings that occurred during i the increase in average interest bearing deposits is primarily attributable to the increase in average interest checking and money market accounts due to growth in our wealthbuilder family of deposit products 
the growth was generated primarily in the arizona market with some growth attributable to our new golden valley  minnesota branch office

net interest income for the month periods ended december  and also reflected mark to market losses on the value of derivative contracts  which decreased net interest income by  and  respectively 
without the interest income charged off and the mark to market adjustments on these derivative contracts for the two periods  net interest margin would have been percent for the months ended december  and percent for the months ended december  the following condensed information summarizes the major factors combining to create the changes to net interest income  spread and margin during as compared to lettered explanations following the summary describe causes of the changes in these major factors 
net interest income analysis vs 
for the years ended december  change amounts in millions total interest income decreased due to decrease in yield on interest earnings assets driven by decrease in yield on loans a decrease in yield on investments b the decreases in yield on interest earning assets were offset by increase in average earning assets driven by increase in average loans c increase in average investments d total interest expense decreased due to decrease in cost of interest bearing liabilities driven by decrease in cost of interest bearing deposits e decrease in cost of borrowings f these decreases were coupled with increase in average interest bearing liabilities driven by increase in average borrowings g offset by decrease in average interest bearing deposits h from continuing operations for all periods presented 
a our decreased loan yield is reflective of the lower interest rate environment during the lower rate environment was caused by several federal reserve reductions in the federal funds target rate causing prime rate to decrease significantly during and continuing into and the daily average prime rate in was percent as compared to percent for the lower prime rate caused floating rate loans to reprice at lower levels and new loans to be originated at interest rate levels lower than those originated in the prior period 
b the decreased yield on investments was also reflective of the lower interest rate environment during c average loans remained relatively stable during in spite of a significant decline in period end loans at december  versus december  d average investments increased in to maintain an acceptable average earning asset portfolio and related interest income 
the increase in average investments in caused the mix in the earning asset portfolio to change resulting in downward pressure on net interest margin 
e the decrease in cost of interest bearing deposits was reflective of the lower interest rate environment during floating rate deposit accounts repriced at lower interest rate levels and certificates of deposit renewed or were originated at lower interest rate levels than those in the prior period 
f borrowing costs decreased due to the lower interest rate environment 
the lower interest rates were reflected in decreased cost on our million floating rate subordinated debentures  our million floating rate loan  floating rate federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements with customers 
g average borrowings increased in due to higher average balances of federal funds purchased  customer repurchase agreements and fhlb advances 
h average deposits in decreased largely due to a million reduction in brokered and national market certificates of deposit during the months ended december  net interest income and margin in future periods may be impacted by several factors 
changes in net interest income are dependent upon the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the movement of interest rates and the level of nonperforming assets 
achieving net interest margin growth is dependent on our ability to generate higher yielding assets and lower cost funding sources such as deposits and borrowings 
if variable index rates  such as the prime rate  were to decline  we could experience compression of our net interest margin depending upon the timing and amount of any reductions  as it is possible that interest rates paid on some deposits and borrowings may not decline as quickly  or to the same extent  as the decline in the yield on interest rate sensitive assets such as commercial and other loans 
competition for checking  savings and money market deposits  important sources of lower cost funds for us  is intense 
we could also experience net interest margin compression if rates paid on deposits and borrowings increase  or as a result of new pricing strategies and lower rates offered on loan products in response to competitive pressures  rates on interest bearing liabilities increase faster  or to a greater extent  than the increase in the yield on interest rate sensitive assets 
the level and nature of the impact cannot be precisely ascertained 
federal reserve actions in response to economic developments can vary causing prime and other rates to adjust and  in some cases  immediately impact our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these factors  including the competitive environment in the markets in which we operate  the multitude of financial and investment products available to the public and the monetary policies of the federal reserve  can materially impact our operating results 
therefore  we cannot predict  with any degree of certainty  prospects for net interest income and net interest margin in future periods 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for information relating to the impact of fluctuating interest rates on our future net interest income prospects 
provision for credit losses 
we determine a provision for credit losses which we consider sufficient to maintain our allowance for credit losses at a level considered adequate to provide for an estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses in the remaining loan and lease portfolio that have been incurred as of each balance sheet date 
the provision for credit losses for the year ended december  was  as compared to million in and million in net loan and lease charge offs were million  or percent of average loans and leases in compared with million  or percent in and  or percent in the decrease in the provision for credit losses in reflected the resolution of a significant amount of nonperforming loans that were reserved for at december  and were reduced to  at december  from million at december  of the million of charge offs in  million related to one commercial loan 
 had been reserved for on that loan at december  the provision for credit losses is calculated as part of the determination of the allowance for credit losses and the related provision for credit losses is a critical accounting policy which involves consideration of a number of factors such as loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies in the loan and lease portfolio  the value of underlying collateral on problem loans  general economic conditions and our assessment of credit risk in the current loan and lease portfolio 
periodic fluctuations in the provision for credit losses result from our assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  however  actual loan losses may vary from current estimates 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million at december  compared with and million at december  and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item  financial condition loan portfolio allowance for credit losses and critical accounting policies for further discussion of the components of the allowance for credit losses  our systematic methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance and additional data pertaining to charge offs  recoveries and other related information 
noninterest income 
noninterest income  primarily driven by insurance commissions  is becoming a more significant source of revenues for us as we continue to emphasize our goal of focusing on local relationship banking and providing a broad range of financial products and services that will meet the needs of our customers  both commercial and consumer 
our noninterest income increased approximately million  or percent  in largely due to increased insurance commissions  including commissions related to acquisitions made during and fees on loans and brokerage income increased in while service charges  trust and financial services income  net gain on sales of securities and rental income declined 
noninterest income increased approximately million  or percent  in largely due to a full year of insurance commission income generated by milne scali 
service charges  trust and financial services income and rental income also increased  while fees on loans  brokerage income and net gain on sale of securities declined 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the major categories of our noninterest income as well as the amount and percent of change between each of the periods presented 
related information and significant changes are discussed in lettered explanations following the table noninterest income increase decrease for the years ended december  in thousands insurance commissions      a fees on loans    b service charges c brokerage income  d trust and financial services  e net gain on sales of securities  f rental income other  g total noninterest income 
     from continuing operations for all periods presented 
a in  insurance commissions increased due to increased commission and profit sharing income at milne scali in phoenix 
the increase also reflected production from recent acquisitions 
in  insurance commissions increased due to a full year of production of milne scali  acquired in april profit sharing income received primarily during the first quarter of each year included in the amounts above totaled approximately million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
b the increase in fees on loans reflects fees associated with loans originated and sold  fees associated with the mortgage loan and student loan financing programs and some fees associated with commercial credit line availability 
the decrease in noninterest income loan fees in primarily reflects a decline in loan generation due to reduced loan demand  which was reflective of the economic environment during loan volume generation and the related loan fees associated with such loans can be subject to significant fluctuations making it difficult to anticipate the amount of loans that will be originated or placed and related loan fees that will be recognized in future periods 
c service charges increased in as the bank continued to increase its wealthbuilder interest checking and money market account volume along with an increase in non interest bearing deposits which are primarily business deposit relationships that tend to utilize a greater level of fee based deposit services 
d in  brokerage income increased primarily due to increased production in the minnesota market 
in  brokerage income declined largely due to the bank having fewer brokers on staff in minnesota 
e the decrease in trust and financial services income is attributable to a  fee recognized in by the bank s financial services division for management of the sale of two companies on behalf of a customer 
the increase reflects the  fee 
this fee income was offset by decreases in other fee income in the trust and financial services division including the loss of fee income associated with the bnc us opportunities fund llc  which was terminated during f net gain on sales of securities varies depending on the nature of investment securities sales transacted during the respective periods 
we cannot guarantee our ability to generate realized gains in the future given the level of interest rates 
in the future  the investment portfolio risk reward management process may require us to recognize net realized losses in order to optimize the forward looking profile of the portfolio 
g other income 
the increase is primarily attributable to the receipt of  by milne scali 
the payment related to the final resolution of a reinsurance program previously associated with milne scali 
additionally  boli bank owned life insurance income was approximately  during compared with approximately  during the increase in other income in as compared to is also attributable to boli income as the boli program was initiated during the second half of noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased approximately million  or percent  in primarily as a result of our expanding presence in the arizona and minnesota markets 
noninterest expense increased approximately million  or percent  in primarily as a result of the april milne scali acquisition and our expanding presence in the arizona market

a salaries and employee benefits expenses increased in due to growth and expansion in our banking and insurance segments  particularly in our minnesota and arizona markets 
also reflected a full year of expense associated with management talent added in late and new management team members added during also included a  payment related to the termination of employment of a former officer of our insurance subsidiary 
the payment represented the acceleration of the remaining salary due under his multi year employment contract 
the increase is largely attributable to the addition of banking personnel  particularly in the arizona market 
average full time equivalents for each year in the three year period ended december  were  and  respectively 
b occupancy expenses increased in due to the addition of the esplanade location in phoenix  the golden valley location in minnesota  and the tucson  salt lake city  prescott valley and denver insurance locations 
c depreciation and amortization expenses related to fixed assets increased in due to the expansion discussed in b above  primarily in our arizona and minnesota markets 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased in due to the milne scali acquisition along with costs associated with additional expansion in the arizona market 
d professional services expenses increased due to an increase in brokerage retainage and clearing fees resulting from the increase in brokerage production as well as increases in legal  software support  appraisal and recording and other consulting fees 
the decrease is attributable to decreased expenses in a number of areas including brokerage clearing and retainage expense resulting from the decrease in associated brokerage revenue  appraisal and recording fees  audit fees  other consulting fees  legal and collection fees and software support fees 
e office supplies  telephone and postage expenses increased due to the expansion described in b above  primarily in our arizona and minnesota markets 
increases in this line item in are associated with the milne scali acquisition and additional expenses associated with expansion in the arizona market 
f amortization of intangible assets expenses increased primarily due to amortization of the insurance customer list intangibles added when we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of several small insurance agencies 
reflects a full year of amortization of the milne scali customer list intangibles 
g marketing and promotion expenses increased in primarily due to market expansion and the associated advertising and marketing 
h the increase in other noninterest expense is due to increases in several different items included in this category such as travel  other employee benefits  insurance  business meals and entertainment  dues and publications and correspondent bank charges 
i noninterest expense divided by an amount equal to net interest income plus noninterest income 
j total operating expenses as a percent of average assets have increased as our profile has changed from that of a traditional banking organization to an organization with a broader base of financial product and service offerings the revenues and expenses of which are generally not asset based 
income taxes 
we recorded income tax expense of and million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our effective tax rates were  and percent for the month periods ended december   and  respectively 
the effective tax rates were lower than the statutory rates principally due to tax exempt income on municipal securities and  for part of and all of  tax exempt income associated with million of bank owned life insurance 
the determination of current and deferred income taxes is a critical accounting policy which is based on complex analyses of many factors including interpretations of federal and state income tax laws  the differences between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities temporary differences  estimates of amounts due or owed  the timing of reversal of temporary differences and current financial accounting standards 
actual results could differ significantly from the estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax liabilities 
additional detail on income taxes is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item and critical accounting policies 
financial condition overview 
although subsequent sections of this discussion and analysis of financial condition address certain aspects of our major assets and liabilities in significant detail  the following two tables are presented as a general overview of the financial condition of the company 
total assets increased approximately million  or percent  between december  and december  and approximately million  or percent  between december  and december  our total assets at december  were approximately million

   other assets      f goodwill      g other intangible assets  net    total assets      a the decrease in cash and due from banks is primarily attributable to an account reclassification program that was implemented during and results in the bank holding less cash at the federal reserve 
b during  we purchased million of investment securities while we sold million and there were million of investment securities that matured and were paid off 
we used the proceeds from the investment security sales and maturities to fund some of the loans held for sale discussed in c below as well as real estate construction and commercial and industrial loans discussed in d below 
during  investment securities available for sale increased as loan volume decreased see d below and we maintained a somewhat static earning asset portfolio 
c loans held for sale at december  represent loans originated under mortgage loan and student loan financing programs initiated during d loans held for investment increased during the second half of due to increases in real estate construction and commercial and industrial loans 
loan volume in was negatively impacted by planned loan reductions and the completion of some financed commercial real estate projects 
the loan reductions were not offset by loan growth due to a lack of loan demand driven by economic conditions during the year 
it is difficult to predict  with any degree of certainty  loan volume in future periods 
e the increase in premises and equipment is primarily attributable to our renovation of a banking facility in golden valley  minnesota  some additional upgrading of our location at east main avenue in bismarck  the purchase of land and a building in tucson and the purchase of land for a future bank site in shakopee  minnesota 
the increase is attributable to the purchase of the milne scali building in phoenix  arizona in march for its appraised value of million  the construction of a facility in scottsdale  arizona  leasehold improvements related to the relocation of our office at east camelback road  phoenix to east camelback road  the purchase of property in golden valley  minnesota and some improvements to our office building at east main avenue  bismarck  north dakota 
f the increase in other assets is primarily attributable to the purchase of million of bank owned life insurance during the third quarter of g goodwill increased during due to the payment of the remaining earnout payments related to the milne scali acquisition and goodwill generated by three insurance agency acquisitions and a mortgage company acquisition 
goodwill increased in due to a million earnout payment related to the purchase of milne scali and the purchase of iasw in december our total liabilities increased approximately million  or percent  between december  and december  and increased million  or percent  between december  and december  total liabilities at december  were approximately million

investment securities available for sale 
our investment policy is designed to enhance net income and return on equity through prudent management of risk  ensure liquidity for cash flow requirements  help manage interest rate risk  ensure collateral is available for public deposits  advances and repurchase agreements and manage asset diversification 
in managing the portfolio  we seek a balance between current income yield and future market value volatility  while simultaneously managing credit and liquidity risks 
the goal of this process is to maximize our longer term profitability as well as the economic performance of the portfolio over the long term 
investments are centrally managed in order to maximize compliance federal laws and regulations place certain restrictions on the amounts and types of investments we may hold and effectiveness of overall investing activities 
the primary goal of our investment policy is to contribute to our overall profitability 
the objective is to purchase and own securities and combinations of securities with good risk reward characteristics 
good risk reward securities are those identified through thorough analysis of the cash flows and potential cash flows as well as market value and potential future market value of the security in question given various interest rate scenarios 
investment strategies are developed in light of a constant view of our overall asset liability position 
as it relates to investment strategies  the focus of our asset liability management committee alco is to determine the impact of interest rate changes on both future income and market value of securities in the portfolio

during  the amount of available for sale securities decreased million in order to provide liquidity to fund earning asset growth in the form of loans  and  in particular  loans held for sale 
in light of our overall asset liability position  much of the decrease in available for sale securities was in the us government agency mortgage backed securities down million and cmos down million because of their forward looking economic risk reward profiles relative to other types of securities within the portfolio and that of other earning asset opportunities 
the volume in state and municipal bonds  us government agency securities and corporate bonds was relatively unchanged for the year 
during the first quarter of  the available for sale portfolio increased million from million as of december  to million in order to maintain the level of earning assets while planned loan reductions and the completion of some financed commercial real estate projects reduced the loan portfolio by million during the same period 
over the remaining three quarters of  the available for sale portfolio decreased by million to end the year at million as proceeds from sales and maturities  net of new purchases were directed toward an increase in loan volume for the latter three quarters of finally  the overall level of market interest rates increased during and the yield curve experienced a flattening relative to the end of in carrying out the ongoing portfolio management objective to purchase and own securities and combinations of securities with good risk reward characteristics  and in constant light of managing the available for sale portfolio s risk reward profile in the context of our overall balance sheet  we engaged in securities transactions that generated net realized securities gains of  during we cannot guarantee our ability to generate realized gains in the future such as those recognized during recent years given the current level of interest rates 
in the future  the risk reward management process may require us to recognize net realized losses in order to optimize the forward looking economic profile of the portfolio and balance sheet 
during  the amount of available for sale securities increased million in order to maintain earning asset portfolio levels while planned loan reductions and the completion of some financed commercial real estate projects reduced the loan portfolio by million 
much of the increase in available for sale securities was directed toward cmos because of their economic risk reward profiles due to the structure of the cmo cash flows relative to mortgage backed or other types of securities and the ability to pledge such securities as collateral for borrowings at the fhlb 
in the process of carrying out the portfolio management objective to purchase securities and combinations of securities with good economic risk reward characteristics  we decreased us government agency mortgage backed securities and us government agency securities by and million  respectively  and increased cmos and state and municipal bonds by and million  respectively 
given our forecasted level of future earnings  we increased our holdings of state and municipal bonds by million in order to increase our level of tax exempt income 
the first half of saw the level of interest rates  including interest rates for mortgages  decline to record or near record lows 
the pace of mortgage refinancing reached record levels in the second quarter of during the third quarter of  interest rates rose from the record lows of the first half of the year 
this decreased mortgage prepayments from their earlier levels 
this made a volatile year for interest rates and mortgage prepayments 
the ongoing portfolio management process described above and individual security risk reward analysis led to the sale of individual securities whose forward looking risk reward profiles given the changed interest rate and prepayment environments were inferior to other securities available for purchase 
this analysis and ongoing management of the portfolio s forward looking risk reward profile resulted in transactions that generated net realized securities gains of  during during  we increased us government agency mortgage backed securities  us government agency securities  and state and municipal bonds by million   and million  respectively and decreased cmos and corporate debt securities by and million  respectively 
the million reduction in corporate debt securities during allowed us to manage our risk based capital position as such securities are risk weighted at percent for risk based capital purposes 
given our earnings in the third and fourth quarters of and our then forecasted level of future earnings  we increased our holdings of state and municipal bonds by million in order to increase our level of future tax exempt income 
in addition to the role state and municipal bonds play in managing our tax position  state and municipal bonds offer an attractive risk reward profile when considered in combination with other securities in the portfolio cmos and mortgage backed securities and our overall balance sheet position 
in addition  during  mortgage rates declined to their lowest levels in decades 
this decrease in mortgage rates increased the level of mortgage refinancing and prepayments for us government agency mortgage backed securities and cmos 
the ongoing portfolio management process and individual security risk reward analysis described above led to the sale of individual securities whose forward looking risk reward profiles given the lower interest rate and increased prepayment environment were inferior to other securities available for purchase 
this analysis and ongoing management of the portfolio s forward looking risk reward profile resulted in transactions that generated net realized securities gains of million during at december   we held no securities of any single issuer  other than us government agency securities and agency mortgage backed securities and cmos  that exceeded percent of stockholders equity 
a significant portion of our investment securities portfolio approximately percent at december  was pledged as collateral for public deposits and borrowings  including borrowings with the fhlb 
federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock 
our equity securities consisted of  and million of federal reserve bank frb stock at december   and  respectively  and  and million of fhlb stock at december   and  respectively 
our holdings in frb stock increased due to the amount of capital stock issued by the bank 
from to  our investment in fhlb stock fluctuated with our usage of fhlb advances

a commercial and industrial loans decreased in due to planned loan pay downs  loan pay offs and the lack of loan demand due to economic conditions 
b the decrease in real estate mortgage loans during reflects the completion of some financed commercial real estate projects 
c the increase in is primarily attributable to commercial real estate construction loan growth in our arizona and minnesota markets 
d the decrease in agricultural loans is primarily due to loan pay offs in the north dakota market 
while prospects for loan growth appear to be favorable in some of our markets  future loan growth potential is subject to volatility 
our loan portfolio is concentrated in commercial  industrial and real estate loans and we have credit concentrations in certain industries see concentrations of credit and certain geographic concentrations that relate to our primary market areas 
a downturn in certain sectors of the economy could adversely impact our borrowers 
this could  in turn  reduce the demand for loans and impact the borrowers ability to repay their loans  while also decreasing our net interest margin 
taking a conservative posture relative to credit underwriting  we believe  is a prudent course of action 
we believe it is in our best interest and in the interest of our stockholders to focus attention on our quality customer relationships and to avoid growth in other than high quality credit 
we cannot predict with any degree of certainty the full impact of current or future economic conditions on our ability to generate loan volume or the ultimate impact of economic conditions on our currently existing portfolio of loans 
see factors that may affect future results of operations included under item of part i 
credit policy  underwriting  approval and review procedures 
we follow a uniform credit policy that sets forth underwriting and loan administration criteria 
the board of directors the board establishes our loan policy  including lending guidelines for the various types of credit we offer based upon the recommendations of senior lending management 
we have an executive credit committee that approves loans over a certain size 
our loan policy is reviewed and reaffirmed by the board at least annually 
we delegate lending decision authority among various lending officers and the executive credit committee based on the size of the customer s credit relationship with bnc 
all loans and commitments approved in excess of  are presented to the board on a quarterly basis for summary review 
any exceptions to loan policies and guidelines  to the extent the credit relationship amount exceeds individual loan officer lending authorities  are subject to special approval by the bank s chief credit officer or the appropriate credit committee 
underwriting criteria are based upon the risks associated with each type of credit offered  the related borrowers and types of collateral 
in underwriting commercial loans  we emphasize the borrower s earnings history  capitalization and secondary sources of repayment 
in most instances  we require third party guarantees or highly liquid collateral 
our credit administration function includes an internal loan review department that reviews established levels of our loan portfolio on a continuous basis 
loan review personnel are not involved in any way in the credit underwriting or approval process 
additionally  our lenders  loan review staff  chief credit officer  executive credit committee and various management team members review credit related information monthly 
such information includes  but may not be limited to  delinquencies  classified and nonperforming assets  and other information 
such reviews are conducted in order to evaluate credit risk within our credit portfolio and to review and establish the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
loan participations 
pursuant to our lending policy  loans may not exceed percent of the bank s legal lending limit except to the extent collateralized by us treasury securities or bank deposits and  accordingly  excluded from the bank s legal lending limit unless the chief credit officer and the executive credit committee grant prior approval 
to accommodate customers whose financing needs exceed lending limits and internal loan restrictions relating primarily to industry concentration  the bank sells loan participations to outside participants without recourse 
loan participations sold on a nonrecourse basis to outside financial institutions were as follows as of the dates indicated loan participations sold december  in thousands from continuing operations for all periods presented 
the bank generally retains the right to service the loans as well as the right to receive a portion of the interest income on the loans 
many of the loans sold by the bank are commercial lines of credit for which balances and related payment streams cannot be reasonably estimated in order to determine the fair value of the servicing rights and or future interest income retained by the bank 
we cannot reliably predict our ability to continue to generate or sell loan participations in future periods or the terms of any such sales 
concentrations of credit 
our credit policies emphasize diversification of risk among industries  geographic areas and borrowers 
for purposes of the analysis of concentrations of credit as of december  the total outstanding loans as well as all outstanding loan commitments were included 
as of december   we identified two concentrations of loans exceeding percent of total loans and loan commitments outstanding 
these concentrations were in real estate and construction  which represented and percent  respectively  of total loans and loan commitments outstanding 
the real estate loans and commitments were extended to customers who are diversified across our market areas and who can generally be categorized as indicated below percent of total outstanding number of loans and customers loan commitments non residential and apartment building operators  developers and lessors of real property real estate holding companies 
total loans and commitments in the construction category were extended to customers who are located primarily in minnesota  iowa  north dakota and south dakota and who can generally be categorized as indicated below percent of total outstanding number of loans and customers loan commitments general building contractors special trade contractors heavy construction  excluding building total the contractors are involved in various aspects of the construction industry  including highway and street construction  water sewer drilling  plumbing  heating and air conditioning  commercial painting  electrical  concrete and excavating and foundation contractors 
loans in this category are secured  in many cases  by construction equipment 
we continually monitor industry and other credit concentrations as part of our credit risk management strategies 
in cases where significant concentrations exist without sufficient diversification and other mitigating factors  we generally sell loans without recourse to outside financial institutions see loan participations 
loan maturities 
the following table sets forth the remaining maturities of loans in each major category of our portfolio as of december  actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are evaluated in the same manner as new credit applications maturities of loans over year through years over years one year fixed floating fixed floating or less rate rate rate rate total in thousands commercial and industrial      real estate mortgage       real estate construction       agricultural      consumer other    lease financing   total principal amount of loans       maturities are based upon contractual maturities 
floating rate loans include loans that would reprice prior to maturity if base rates change 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for further discussion regarding repricing of loans and other assets 
interest rate caps and floors 
from time to time we may use off balance sheet instruments  principally interest rate caps and floors  to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of on balance sheet items  including loans 
see liquidity  market and credit risk  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item for further discussion about accounting policies applicable to derivative financial instruments and currently outstanding instruments 
nonperforming loans and assets 
nonperforming loans consist of loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest  nonaccrual and restructured loans 
other nonperforming assets includes other real estate owned and repossessed assets 
our lending personnel are responsible for continuous monitoring of the quality of the loan portfolio 
officers are expected to maintain loan quality and deal with credit issues in a timely and proactive manner 
loan officers are responsible for regular reviews of past due loans in their respective portfolios 
the loan portfolio is also monitored regularly and examined by our loan review personnel 
loans demonstrating weaknesses are downgraded in a timely fashion and the board receives a listing of all such loans on a quarterly basis 
the following table sets forth  as of the dates indicated  the amounts of nonperforming loans and other assets  the allowance for credit losses and certain related ratios nonperforming assets december  dollars in thousands nonperforming loans loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest  nonaccrual loans    restructured loans total nonperforming loans    other real estate owned and repossessed assets total nonperforming assets    allowance for credit losses      ratio of total nonperforming loans to total loans 
ratio of total nonperforming assets to total assets 

ratio of allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans from continuing operations for all periods presented 
if the company s nonaccrual and restructured loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  we would have recognized additional interest income of     and  for the years ended december     and  respectively 
the interest income on nonaccrual and restructured loans actually included in our net income was     and  for the years ended december     and respectively 
loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest include loans over days past due which we believe  based on our specific analysis of the loans  do not present doubt about the collection of interest and principal in accordance with the loan contract 
loans in this category must be well secured and in the process of collection 
our lending and management personnel monitor these loans closely 
nonaccrual loans include loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
accrual of interest is discontinued when we believe  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  accrued but uncollected interest income applicable to the current reporting period is reversed against interest income of the current period 
accrued but uncollected interest income applicable to previous reporting periods is charged against the allowance for credit losses 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when a problem loan is finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual write down or charge off of the principal balance of the loan which may necessitate additional charges to earnings 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including a reduction of the interest rate or the deferral of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur 
we had no restructured loans in our portfolio at december  other real estate owned and repossessed assets represents properties and other assets acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure 
such properties and assets are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
they are initially recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition establishing a new cost basis 
write downs to fair value at the time of acquisition are charged to the allowance for credit losses 
after foreclosure  we perform valuations periodically and the real estate or assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
write downs  revenues and expenses incurred subsequent to foreclosure are charged to operations as recognized incurred 
we had no outstanding other real estate owned or repossessed assets at december  our ratios of total nonperforming loans to total loans  and total nonperforming assets to total assets  decreased between december  and december  the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans increased between december  and december  this ratio at december  was percent as compared to percent at december  these improvements in nonperforming loan asset ratios is primarily the result of a sharp decrease in nonperforming loans  which declined to  at december   from million at december  this decrease is due primarily to the full payment of a million loan and the resolution of a million loan that resulted in a charge off of million of which  was reserved for at december  
potential problem loans 
in accordance with accounting standards  we identify loans considered impaired and the valuation allowance attributable to these loans 
impaired loans generally include loans on which we believe  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and which are analyzed for a specific reserve allowance 
we generally consider all loans risk graded substandard and doubtful as well as nonaccrual and restructured loans as impaired 
potential problem loans at december   not including the past due  nonaccrual and restructured loans reported above  totaled million as compared to million at december  a significant portion of these potential problem loans are not in default but may have characteristics such as recent adverse operating cash flows or general risk characteristics that the loan officer feels might jeopardize the future timely collection of principal and interest payments 
the ultimate resolution of these credits is subject to changes in economic conditions and other factors 
these loans are closely monitored to ensure that our position as creditor is protected to the fullest extent possible 
allowance for credit losses 
credit risk is the risk of loss from a customer default 
we have in place a process to identify and manage our credit risk 
the process includes initial credit review and approval  periodic monitoring to measure compliance with credit agreements and internal credit policies  internal credit review  monitoring changes in the risk ratings of loans and leases  identification of problem loans and leases and special procedures for collection of problem loans and leases 
the risk of loss is difficult to quantify and is subject to fluctuations in values and general economic conditions and other factors 
as discussed previously  the determination of the allowance for credit losses is a critical accounting policy  which involves estimates and our judgment on a number of factors such as net charge offs  delinquencies in the loan and lease portfolio and general and economic conditions 
we consider the allowance for credit losses of million adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of december  however  no assurance can be given that we will not  in any particular period  sustain loan and lease losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved  or that subsequent evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio  in light of factors then prevailing  including economic conditions and our ongoing credit review process  will not require significant increases in the allowance for credit losses 
a protracted economic slowdown and or a decline in commercial  industrial or real estate segments may have an adverse impact on the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses by increasing credit risk and the risk of potential loss 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item and critical accounting policies for further information concerning accounting policies associated with the allowance for credit losses 
we maintain our allowance for credit losses at a level considered adequate to provide for an estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses in the remaining loan and lease portfolio that have been incurred as of each balance sheet date 
the loan and lease portfolio and other credit exposures are reviewed regularly to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
in determining the level of the allowance  we evaluate the allowance necessary for specific nonperforming loans and also estimate losses in other credit exposures 
the resultant three allowance components are specific reserves  reserves for homogeneous loan pools and a qualitative reserve 
these components are fully described under critical accounting policies 
continuous credit monitoring processes and the analysis of loss components is the principal method we rely upon to ensure that changes in estimated credit loss levels are reflected in our allowance for credit losses on a timely basis 
we also consider experience of peer institutions and regulatory guidance in addition to our own experience 
loans  leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the amount of the allowance for credit losses is highly dependent upon our estimates of variables affecting valuation  appraisals of collateral  evaluations of performance and status  and the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans 
such estimates  appraisals  evaluations and cash flows may be subject to frequent adjustments due to changing economic prospects of borrowers  lessees or properties 
these estimates are reviewed periodically 
actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision may be either greater than or less than actual net charge offs 
the related provision for credit losses  which is charged to income  is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance to the level determined appropriate through the application of the above processes and those discussed below in the critical accounting policies section 
at yearend  our total allowance was million which equates to approximately and times the average gross charge offs for the last three and five years  respectively  and and times the average net charge offs for the same three and five year periods  respectively 
because historical charge offs are not necessarily indicative of future charge off levels  we also give consideration to other risk indicators when determining the appropriate allowance level 
those risk factors have been summarized above 
our charge off policy is generally consistent with regulatory standards 
our chief credit officer and loan review manager have the primary responsibility of affirming our systematic allowance methodology  performing credit loss migration analyses and assessing the allowance components in relation to estimated and actual charge off trends 
this analysis is presented to members of management who are responsible for assessing and reporting on the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses as well as recommending revisions to our methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance as they become necessary 
concentrations of credit risk are discussed under concentrations of credit 
concentrations exist in real estate and construction loans and commitments 
additionally  a geographic concentration of credit risk also arises because we have historically operated primarily in the upper midwest with percent of loans outstanding as of december  having been extended to customers in minnesota  north dakota and south dakota 
as of december   percent of our loans had been extended to customers in arizona 
other groups of credit risk may not constitute a significant concentration  but are analyzed based on other evident risk factors for the purpose of determining an adequate allowance level 
nonperforming and potential problem loans are defined and discussed under nonperforming loans and assets and potential problem loans 
many of these loans are specifically analyzed for purposes of determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
estimating the risk and amount of loss on any loan is subjective and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates 
although we believe that the allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover probable losses in the loan and lease portfolio  there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual credit losses in the future 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses 
such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  activity in the allowance for credit losses  including amounts of loans charged off  amounts of recoveries  additions to the allowance charged to operating expense  the ratio of net charge offs to average total loans  the ratio of the allowance to total loans at the end of each period and the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans analysis of allowance for credit losses for the years ended december  dollars in thousands balance of allowance for credit losses  beginning of period      charge offs commercial and industrial   real estate mortgage agricultural consumer other lease financing total charge offs    recoveries commercial and industrial real estate mortgage agricultural consumer other lease financing total recoveries net charge offs   provision for credit losses charged to operations     balance of allowance for credit losses  end of period      ratio of net charge offs to average loans average gross loans outstanding during the period      ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans ratio of allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans from continuing operations for all periods presented 
of the million of charge offs for the year ended december   approximately million relates to one commercial contractor 
a  reserve was established for this credit at december  our ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans was percent at december  compared with percent one year earlier 
the ratio at december  reflects million of charge offs over the course of the month period ended december   as well as the reduced reserve requirement related to the sharp decrease in nonperforming loans during the same period 
the table below presents  for the periods indicated  an allocation of the allowance for credit losses among the various loan categories and sets forth the percentage of loans in each category to gross loans

at times earning asset growth can outpace core deposit growth resulting in the use of brokered deposits and out of market certificates of deposit and other borrowed funds 
see borrowed funds 
this trend has been common in the banking industry because of the proliferation of nonbank competitors and the multitude of financial and investment products available to customers as well as the need to utilize such funds in the process of our overall balance sheet management 
at times  access to brokered and out of market deposits is available at maturities and rates more favorable than those available in our local markets 
as of december   we held a total of million of national market certificates of deposit and million of deposits acquired through brokers 
under current fdic regulations  only well capitalized financial institutions may fund themselves with brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval 
our bank was considered well capitalized at december  see capital resources and expenditures and note to the consolidated financial statements included under item for a summary of the capital status of the bank

interest rate caps and floors 
from time to time we may use off balance sheet instruments  principally interest rate caps and floors  to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of on balance sheet items  including borrowings 
during may and june  we purchased  for million  interest rate cap contracts with notional amounts totaling million to mitigate interest rate risk in rising rate scenarios 
the referenced interest rate is three month libor with million of percent contracts having three year original maturities and million of percent contracts having five year original maturities

capital resources and expenditures 
we actively monitor compliance with regulatory capital requirements  including risk based and leverage capital measures

during  we completed the renovation of the property in golden valley  minnesota purchased in 
we also purchased property in tucson  arizona for use by insurance personnel 
we also made some improvements to our office building at east main avenue  bismarck  north dakota and purchased property in shakopee  minnesota for a future bank site  which is expected to open in finally  we installed a videoconference system that ties together certain locations 
capital expenditures for will include the construction of the shakopee facility  some remodeling of the exterior of our building at east main avenue in bismarck  the interior of the milne scali building in phoenix  and could include the purchase or lease of additional facilities in our various market areas should such facilities or properties be deemed to add additional franchise value 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of business  we are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
such instruments help us to meet the needs of our customers  manage our interest rate risk and effectuate business combination transactions 
these instruments and commitments  which we enter into for purposes other than trading  carry varying degrees of credit  interest rate or liquidity risk in excess of the amount reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
we have also entered into certain guarantee arrangements that are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
each of these instruments is discussed in the following sections 
commitments to extend credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer provided there is no violation of any condition in the contract 
commitments to extend credit are legally binding and generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
the contractual amount represents our exposure to credit loss in the event of default by the borrower  however  at december   based on current information  no losses were anticipated as a result of these commitments 
we manage this credit risk by using the same credit policies we apply to loans 
collateral is generally required to secure the loans covered by the commitments based on management s credit assessment of the borrower 
the collateral may include marketable securities  real estate and other types of business assets of the borrower such as accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  deposit accounts and general intangibles 
since we expect some of the commitments to expire without being drawn  total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent our future liquidity requirements related to such commitments 
commitments to extend credit are important to us in that they provide sources of liquidity to our customers 
our liquidity is impacted to the extent that the customer draws upon the commitments 
our revenues are impacted to the extent advances of funds are made and interest is earned on such advances of funds or we charge a fee for extending or maintaining the commitment 
such commitments don t typically result in material expenses for us  but rather  result in normal operating expenses involved with processing  approval and other activities associated with the extension and administration of such credit facilities 
our cash flow is impacted to the extent the commitments are drawn upon by our customers 
there are no retained interests  securities issued or other indebtedness incurred by us in connection with these commitments to extend credit  and  other than the obligation to honor the commitment if drawn by the customer  there are no other obligations or liabilities  including contingent obligations or liabilities  arising from such commitments 
at the present time  other than the passage of time or the nonperformance of customers under these commitments  there is no known event  demand  commitment  trend or uncertainty that will result in or is reasonably likely to result in termination of such commitments to a material extent 
the contractual amount of our commitments to extend credit totaled million at december  commercial letters of credit 
commercial letters of credit are issued on behalf of customers to ensure payment or collection in connection with trade transactions 
in the event of a customer s nonperformance  our credit loss exposure is the same as in any extension of credit  up to the letter s contractual amount  however  at december   based on current information  no losses were anticipated as a result of these commitments 
we assess the borrower s credit to determine the necessary collateral  which may include marketable securities  real estate and other types of business assets of the borrower such as accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  deposit accounts and general intangibles 
since the conditions requiring us to fund letters of credit may not occur  our liquidity requirements related to such letters of credit will likely be less than the total outstanding commitments 
commercial letters of credit are an important service provided by us to our commercial customers 
our liquidity is impacted only to the extent we must honor a commercial letter of credit due to nonperformance of the commercial customer 
our revenues are impacted to the extent we are required to perform under the letter of credit and earn interest income on the advanced funds or we charge a fee for issuing or maintaining the letter of credit 
such letters of credit typically don t result in material expenses for us  but rather  result in normal operating expenses involved with processing  approval and other activities associated with the extension and administration of such letters of credit 
our cash flow is impacted to the extent the nonperformance of the customer requires us to advance under the letter of credit 
there are no retained interests  securities issued or other indebtedness incurred by us in connection with these letters of credit  and  other than the obligation to honor the letter of credit  there are no other obligations or liabilities  including contingent obligations or liabilities  arising from such letters of credit 
at the present time  other than the passage of time or nonperformance of customers under their letters of credit  there is no known event  demand  commitment  trend or uncertainty that will result or is reasonably likely to result in termination of such letters of credit to a material extent 
the contractual amount of our commercial letters of credit totaled  at december  performance and financial standby letters of credit 
performance standby letters of credit are irrevocable obligations to the beneficiary on our part to make payment on account of any default by the account party in the performance of a nonfinancial or commercial obligation 
under these arrangements  we could  in the event of the account party s nonperformance  be required to pay a maximum of the amount of issued letters of credit 
under the agreements  we have recourse against the account party up to and including the amount of the performance standby letter of credit 
we evaluate each account party s creditworthiness on a case by case basis and the amount of collateral obtained varies and is based on our credit evaluation of the account party 
as of december   we had outstanding million of performance standby letters of credit 
financial standby letters of credit are irrevocable obligations to the beneficiary on our part to repay money borrowed by or advanced to or for the account of the account party or to make payment on account of any indebtedness undertaken by the account party  in the event that the account party fails to fulfill its obligation to the beneficiary 
under these arrangements  we could  in the event of the account party s nonperformance  be required to pay a maximum of the amount of issued letters of credit 
under the agreements  we have recourse against the account party up to and including the amount of the financial standby letter of credit 
we evaluate each account party s creditworthiness on a case by case basis and the amount of collateral obtained varies and is based on our credit evaluation of the account party 
as of december   we had outstanding million of financial standby letters of credit 
million of these letters of credit were participated to other financial institutions 
performance and financial standby letters of credit are also an important service we provide to our commercial customers 
our liquidity is impacted only to the extent we must honor such a letter of credit due to nonperformance of the customer 
our revenues are impacted to the extent we are required to perform under the letter of credit and interest is earned on outstanding advances or if we charge a fee for issuing or administering the letter of credit 
such letters of credit typically don t result in material expenses for us  but rather  normal operating expenses involved with processing  approval and other activities associated with the extension and administration of such letters of credit 
our cash flow is impacted to the extent the nonperformance of the customer requires us to advance under the letter of credit 
there are no retained interests  securities issued or other indebtedness incurred by us in connection with these letters of credit and  other than the obligation to honor the letter of credit  there are no other obligations or liabilities  including contingent obligations or liabilities  arising from such letters of credit 
at the present time  other than the passage of time or nonperformance of customers under their letters of credit  there is no known event  demand  commitment  trend or uncertainty that will result in or is reasonably likely to result in terminations of such letters of credit to a material extent 
interest rate swaps  caps and floors 
interest rate swaps are contracts to exchange fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations based on a notional principal amount 
from time to time we may enter into swaps to hedge our balance sheet against fluctuations in interest rates 
interest rate caps and floors are used to protect our balance sheet from unfavorable movements in interest rates while allowing benefit from favorable movements 
the credit risk related to interest rate contracts is that counterparties may be unable to meet the contractual terms of the agreements 
this risk is estimated by calculating the present value of the cost to replace outstanding contracts in a gain position at current market rates  reported on a net basis by counterparties 
we manage the credit risk of our interest rate contracts through bilateral collateral agreements  credit approvals  limits and monitoring procedures 
additionally  we reduce the assumed counterparty credit risk through master netting agreements that permit us to settle interest rate contracts with the same counterparty on a net basis 
at december   we held million of interest rate caps 
these caps are reflected in the december  balance sheet at their combined fair value of  interest rate swaps  caps and floors can be an effective way to hedge interest rate risk 
due to the fact that they are purchased at fair value  which is generally significantly less than the notional amount of the instrument  our liquidity is not generally materially affected by the origination of such instruments 
the amount of revenues or expenses associated with such instruments is dependent upon the accounting methodology selected for the instruments ie  whether such instruments are officially designated as hedges under applicable accounting standards 
our current interest rate caps are not accounted for as hedges 
therefore  increases in their fair value are presented as a reduction to interest expense while decreases in their fair value are presented as an increase in interest expense 
cash flow is not affected under these instruments other than at the time of purchase and  during their life  if interest rates move in such a fashion that payments under the interest rate caps are received 
there are no retained interests  securities issued or other indebtedness incurred by us in connection with these interest rate caps  and  there are no other obligations or liabilities  including contingent obligations or liabilities  arising from such interest rate caps 
the interest rate caps will terminate upon their scheduled maturity dates  which are in may and june until such time as those contracts mature  there are no known events  demands  commitments  trends or uncertainties that will result in or is reasonably likely to result in termination of the contracts 
we do have the option to sell the contracts at their fair value at any time 
contingent consideration in business combinations 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement related to the iasw asset acquisition in december  additional consideration of up to  may be payable to iasw  subject to the operation of the acquired assets achieving certain financial performance targets 
in accordance with current accounting standards  there is no current carrying amount associated with this contractual obligation 
additionally  there are no recourse provisions associated with this guarantee that would enable us to recover from third parties any of the amounts paid under the guarantee and there are no assets held either as collateral or by third parties that  upon the occurrence of any triggering event or condition under the guarantee  we could obtain and liquidate to recover all or a portion of the amounts paid under the guarantee 
contingent consideration in business combinations  under current accounting standards and provided certain criteria are met  is not required to be recorded at the time of the transaction 
such contingent consideration  which may be based on the financial performance of the acquired entity or other factors  can be an effective tool in maintaining or encouraging certain levels of performance by the acquired entity 
such consideration may be critical to accomplishing the business combination 
our cash flow and liquidity are impacted to the extent the contractual financial performance is attained and we are  therefore  required to make the contingency payments 
there are no known events  demands  commitments  trends or uncertainties  other than the passage of time and the financial performance of the acquiree  that will result in or is reasonably likely to result in termination of the contingent consideration agreement 
guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in company s subordinated debentures 
bnccorp  concurrent with the issuance of preferred securities in july by bnc capital trust i and in july by bnc statutory trust ii  fully and unconditionally guaranteed all obligations of the special purpose trusts related to the trust preferred securities 
note to the consolidated financial statements included under item includes a full description of the nature of the established trusts and the securities issued by the trusts 
there are no recourse provisions associated with these guarantees that would enable bnccorp to recover from third parties any of the amounts paid under the guarantees and there are no assets held either as collateral or by third parties that  upon the occurrence of any triggering event or condition under the guarantees  bnccorp could obtain and liquidate to recover all or a portion of the amounts paid under the guarantees 
the trust preferred securities are important to us in that they provide for a cost effective means of obtaining tier capital for regulatory purposes 
additionally  bnccorp is allowed to deduct  for income tax purposes  amounts paid in respect of the securities and ultimately distributed to the holders of the preferred securities 
our consolidated interest expense reflects interest paid on the preferred securities and cash flows are impacted accordingly 
there are no retained interests other than the common stock of the trusts held by bnccorp  securities issued other than as described above or additional indebtedness incurred by us in connection with these securities  and  there are no other obligations or liabilities  including contingent obligations and liabilities  arising from the securities 
due to recently issued accounting standards  the federal reserve is presently considering the regulatory capital status of such instruments 
a change in the regulatory capital status of these existing instruments could materially impact us in that our consolidated capital ratios would decline if the securities could not be treated as tier capital to certain limits or tier capital to certain limits 
should such a change in regulatory capital status be required to be implemented  bnccorp likely would need to immediately explore opportunities for issuing other instruments that qualify as regulatory capital 
it is difficult to predict  with any degree of certainty  the federal reserve s final decision as it pertains to the capital treatment of such instruments 
indemnifications 
in conjunction with various business combinations  we have entered into certain indemnifications with the contracting parties 
such indemnifications  although considered guarantees under current accounting standards  are not deemed to be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and commitments 
as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item  we have certain contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and commitments 
certain of these commitments have been discussed in the sections above 
at december   the aggregate contractual obligations excluding bank deposits  contingent liabilities and commitments were as follows in thousands payments due by period less contractual obligations than to to after year years years years total total borrowings      annual rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases    total      amount of commitment expiration by period less than to to after other commitments year years years years total commitments to lend     standby and commercial letters of credit    total     liquidity  market and credit risk our business activities generate  in addition to other risks  significant liquidity  market and credit risks 
liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet all present and future financial obligations in a timely manner 
market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices and represents the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will have a negative impact on our earnings or value 
our principal market risk is interest rate risk 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion about interest rate risk and its impact on net interest income 
credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a customer to perform according to the terms of a contract 
we are a party to transactions involving financial instruments that create risks that may or may not be reflected on a traditional balance sheet 
these financial instruments can be subdivided into three categories cash financial instruments  generally characterized as on balance sheet items  include investments  loans  mortgage backed securities  deposits and debt obligations 
credit related financial instruments  generally characterized as off balance sheet items  include such instruments as commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit and performance and financial standby letters of credit 
derivative financial instruments  on balance sheet items as of january   include such instruments as interest rate  foreign exchange  commodity price and equity price contracts  including forwards  swaps and options 
our risk management policies are intended to monitor and limit exposure to liquidity  market and credit risks that arise from each of these financial instruments 
see loan portfolio for a discussion of our credit risk management strategies 
liquidity risk management 
liquidity risk management encompasses our ability to meet all present and future financial obligations in a timely manner 
the objectives of liquidity management policies are to maintain adequate liquid assets  liability diversification among instruments  maturities and customers and a presence in both the wholesale purchased funds market and the retail deposit market 
the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements included under item of part ii present data on cash and cash equivalents provided by and used in operating  investing and financing activities 
in addition to liquidity from core deposit growth  together with repayments and maturities of loans and investments  we utilize brokered deposits  sell securities under agreements to repurchase and borrow overnight federal funds 
the bank is a member of the fhlb  which affords it the opportunity to borrow funds in terms ranging from overnight to years and beyond 
advances from the fhlb are generally collateralized by the bank s mortgage loans and various investment securities 
see investment securities and note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of part ii 
we have also obtained funding through the issuance of subordinated notes  subordinated debentures and long term borrowings 
see borrowed funds  guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in company s subordinated debentures and notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item of part ii for further information on these instruments 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a summary of our major sources and uses of funds 
this summary information is derived from the consolidated statements of cash flows included under item of part ii major sources and uses of funds for the years ended december  in thousands proceeds from fhlb advances   proceeds from sales of investment securities    net increase decrease in deposits    proceeds from maturities of investment securities    net increase in short term borrowings    proceeds from issuance of preferred stock   net increase in long term borrowings   repayments of fhlb advances    purchases of investment securities    net increase decrease in loans    cash paid for milne scali earnouts   additions to premises and equipment    repurchase of preferred stock  cash paid for acquisition of insurance agencies  disposition of discontinued fargo branch  our liquidity is measured by our ability to raise cash when we need it at a reasonable cost and with a minimum of loss 
given the uncertain nature of our customers demands as well as our desire to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities  we must have adequate sources of on and off balance sheet funds that can be acquired in time of need 
accordingly  in addition to the liquidity provided by balance sheet cash flows  liquidity is supplemented with additional sources such as credit lines with the fhlb  credit lines with correspondent banks for federal funds  wholesale and retail repurchase agreements  brokered deposits and direct non brokered national certificates of deposit acquired through national deposit networks 
we measure our liquidity position on a monthly basis 
key factors that determine our liquidity are the reliability or stability of our deposit base  the pledged non pledged status of our investments and potential loan demand 
our liquidity management system divides the balance sheet into liquid assets  and short term liabilities that are assumed to be vulnerable to non replacement under abnormally stringent conditions 
the excess of liquid assets over short term liabilities is measured over a day planning horizon 
assumptions for short term liabilities vulnerable to non replacement under abnormally stringent conditions are based on a historical analysis of the month to month percentage changes in deposits 
the excess of liquid assets over short term liabilities and other key factors such as expected loan demand as well as access to other sources of liquidity such as lines with the fhlb  federal funds and those other supplemental sources listed above are tied together to provide a measure of our liquidity 
we have a targeted range and manage our operations such that these targets can be achieved 
we believe that our prudent management policies and guidelines will ensure adequate levels of liquidity to fund anticipated needs of on and off balance sheet items 
in addition  a contingency funding policy statement identifies actions to be taken in response to an adverse liquidity event 
during  our management team conducted an on site funding crisis simulation designed to model several days of a funding crisis 
as of december   we had established three revolving lines of credit with banks  totaling million 
at december   the bank had not drawn on these lines leaving million available under these revolving lines of credit 
the lines  if drawn upon  mature daily with interest rates that float at the federal funds rate 
the bank has also been approved for repurchase agreement lines of up to million with a major financial institution 
the lines  if utilized  would be collateralized by investment securities 
at december   we also had the ability to draw additional fhlb advances of million based upon the mortgage loans and securities that were then pledged  subject to a requirement to purchase additional fhlb stock 
forward looking statements statements included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical in nature are intended to be  and are hereby identified as forward looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provided by section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
we caution readers that these forward looking statements  including without limitation  those relating to our future business prospects  revenues  working capital  liquidity  capital needs  interest costs  income and expenses  are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements due to several important factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to risks of loans and investments  including dependence on local and regional economic conditions  competition for our customers from other providers of financial services  possible adverse effects of changes in interest rates including the effects of such changes on derivative contracts and associated accounting consequences  risks associated with our acquisition and growth strategies  and other risks which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control 
for a discussion of some of the additional risk factors that might cause such differences  see item of part i  factors that may affect future results of operations 
effects of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  banking organizations do not necessarily gain or lose due to the effects of inflation 
changes in interest rates  which are a major determinant of a financial service organization s profitability  do not necessarily correspond to changes in the prices of goods and services  however  interest rates may change in response to changes in expectations of future inflation 
an analysis of a banking organization s asset and liability structure provides the best indication of how the organization is positioned to respond to changing interest rates and maintain profitability 
the financial statements and supplementary financial data have been prepared  primarily  on a historical basis  which is mandated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
fluctuations in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements note to the consolidated financial statements included under item includes a summary of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements and their related or anticipated impact on the company 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are dependent on estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change and include the determination of the allowance for credit losses  income taxes and impairment testing related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
the following have been identified as critical accounting policies 
allowance for credit losses 
we maintain our allowance for credit losses at a level considered adequate to provide for an estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses in the remaining loan and lease portfolio that have been incurred as of each balance sheet date 
the loan and lease portfolio and other credit exposures are reviewed regularly to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
in determining the level of the allowance  we evaluate the allowance necessary for specific nonperforming loans and also estimate losses in other credit exposures 
the resultant three allowance components are as follows specific reserves 
the amount of specific reserves is determined through a loan by loan analysis of problem loans over a minimum size that considers expected future cash flows  the value of collateral and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to make payments when due 
included in this group are those nonaccrual or renegotiated loans that meet the criteria as being impaired under the definition in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  sfas 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
problem loans also include those credits that have been internally classified as credits requiring management s attention due to underlying problems in the borrower s business or collateral concerns 
under sfas  any allowance on impaired loans is generally based on one of three methods 
the accounting standard requires that impaired loans be measured at either the present value of expected cash flows at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral of the loan 
specific reserves totaled  at december  reserves for homogeneous loan pools 
we make a significant number of loans and leases that  due to their underlying similar characteristics  are assessed for loss as homogeneous pools 
included in the homogeneous pools are consumer loans and commercial loans under a certain size that have been excluded from the specific reserve allocation previously discussed 
we segment the pools by type of loan or lease and  using historical loss information  estimate a loss reserve for each pool 
reserves for homogeneous loan pools totaled million at december  qualitative reserve 
our senior lending management also allocates reserves for special situations that are unique to the measurement period 
these include  among other things  prevailing and anticipated economic trends  such as economic conditions in certain geographic or industry segments of the portfolio and economic trends in the retail lending sector  management s assessment of credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio  delinquency trends  historical loss experience and peer group loss history 
our qualitative reserve totaled  at december  continuous credit monitoring processes and the analysis of loss components is the principal method we rely upon to ensure that changes in estimated credit loss levels are reflected in our allowance for credit losses on a timely basis 
we also consider experience of peer institutions and regulatory guidance in addition to our own experience 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for credit losses 
such agencies may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination 
loans  leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the amount of the allowance for credit losses is highly dependent upon our estimates of variables affecting valuation  appraisals of collateral  evaluations of performance and status  and the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans 
such estimates  appraisals  evaluations and cash flows may be subject to frequent adjustments due to changing economic prospects of borrowers  lessees or properties 
these estimates are reviewed periodically 
actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision may be either greater than or less than actual net charge offs 
the related provision for credit losses  which is charged to income  is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance to the level determined appropriate through application of the above processes 
as indicated above  we employ a systematic methodology for determining our allowance for credit losses that includes an ongoing review process and quarterly adjustment of the allowance 
our process includes periodic loan by loan review for loans that are individually evaluated for impairment as well as detailed reviews of other loans either individually or in pools 
this includes an assessment of known problem loans  potential problem loans and other loans that exhibit indicators of deterioration 
our methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative  in establishing an allowance for credit losses that we believe is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  changes in nonperforming loans and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements and borrowers sensitivity to quantifiable external factors including commodity and finished goods prices as well as acts of nature violent weather  fires  etc 
that occur in a particular period 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in our markets and  in particular  the state of certain industries in our market areas 
size and complexity of individual credits in relation to lending officers background and experience levels  loan structure  extent and nature of waivers of existing loan policies and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in our methodology 
our methodology is  and has been  consistently applied 
however  as we add new products  increase in complexity and expand our geographic coverage  we will enhance our methodology to keep pace with the size and complexity of the loan and lease portfolio 
in this regard  we may  if deemed appropriate  engage outside firms to independently assess our methodology 
on an ongoing basis we perform independent credit reviews of our loan portfolio 
we believe that our systematic methodology continues to be appropriate given our size and level of complexity 
while our methodology utilizes historical and other objective information  the establishment of the allowance for credit losses and the classification of loans is  to some extent  based on our judgment and experience 
we believe that the allowance for credit losses is adequate  as of december   to cover known and inherent risks in the loan and lease portfolio 
however  future changes in circumstances  economic conditions or other factors could cause us to increase or decrease the allowance for credit losses as necessary 
allowance for credit losses impact on earnings 
as indicated above  the determined level of the allowance for credit losses involves assumptions underlying our estimates that reflect highly uncertain matters in the current period 
additionally  a different estimate that could have been used in the current period could have had a material impact on reported financial condition or results of operations 
we are not aware  at this time  of known trends  commitments  events or other uncertainties reasonably likely to occur that would materially affect our methodology or the assumptions used  although changes in the qualitative and quantitative factors noted above could occur at any time and such changes could be of a material nature 
we have used our assumptions to arrive at the level of the allowance for credit losses that we consider adequate to provide for an estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses in the remaining loan and lease portfolio that have been incurred as of december  the qualitative and quantitative factors noted above can reasonably be expected to impact the estimates applied and cause such estimates to change from period to period 
our allowance for credit losses of approximately million necessitated that a provision for credit losses of  be charged to operations for the year ended december  should our analysis have resulted in the need for a higher or lower allowance for credit losses  an additional or reduced amount would have been charged to operations during the period 
for example  should our analysis have indicated the need for an allowance for credit losses of million  an additional  would have been charged to the provision for loan losses resulting in net income of approximately million as compared to the million recorded for the year ended december  had our analysis indicated the need for an allowance for credit losses of million  the provision for credit losses would have been reduced by the full  plus an additional  would have been reversed out of the reserve  resulting in net income of approximately million as compared to the million recorded for the period 
in the past three years there have been changes in the qualitative and quantitative factors noted above 
from period to period  economic situations change  credits may deteriorate or improve and the other factors we consider in arriving at our estimates may change 
however  our basic methodology for determining an appropriate allowance for credit losses has remained relatively stable 
this methodology has resulted in allowance levels of  and million at each of december   and  respectively 
as noted above  the amount of the provision for credit losses charged to operations is directly related to our estimates of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses 
charge offs and recoveries during the applicable periods also impact the level of the allowance for credit losses resulting in a provision for credit losses that could be higher or lower in order to bring the allowance for credit losses in line with our estimates 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method according to sfas under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the amounts of tax currently payable or refundable are recognized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
such differences can relate to differences in accounting for credit losses  depreciation timing differences  unrealized gains and losses on investment securities  deferred compensation  amortization timing differences of intangible assets and leases  which are treated as operating leases for tax purposes and loans for financial statement purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we subscribe to several tax reporting services to allow us to constantly monitor federal and state legislation  regulation and judicial activity to keep abreast of any changes which may affect these assets or liabilities 
the realization of these deferred tax assets and liabilities could differ significantly from the amounts recorded 
our analysis includes consideration of many factors including our continued growth and expansion into new lines of business and taxing jurisdictions such that the company could be subject to different taxing methodologies 
the amount of the assets or liabilities realized is dependent on the tax rates in effect in the taxing jurisdictions we are subject to at the time the temporary differences are recovered 
the tax rates vary from state to state and we continue to achieve nexus in new states which may have higher or lower rates in effect 
we have considered the need for a valuation allowance and have determined the company has a deferred tax asset resulting from certain state tax net operating loss carry forwards which it believes will not be realized 
these losses were incurred in years a unitary return was not filed and the company does not believe it will have sufficient apportioned income to this state to receive a benefit from them before they expire 
in all other respects  the company believes there is credible evidence to expect sufficient taxable income to absorb future deductible temporary differences 
as part of this assessment  we have considered the timing of the expected recoveries of the temporary differences 
current tax liabilities or amounts refundable are recognized based on currently enacted tax legislation  federal and state regulations  rulings and procedures  applicable federal and state judicial rulings and our interpretation thereof 
the company files its federal tax return on a consolidated basis and has taken the position it is a unitary business and files all state returns as such 
we employ a systematic methodology of determining our tax related balances that includes an ongoing review process and quarterly adjustments 
our process includes comparison and reconciliation of recorded amounts to those reported to the taxing authorities 
impairment testing related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or when impairment indicators are present 
these tests are required to be conducted at the reporting unit level 
goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
the north dakota banking group was used as the reporting unit for goodwill and other intangible assets related to the acquisition of various branches and deposits in north dakota 
the mortgage branch was used as the reporting unit for the goodwill related to the acquisition of the mortgage consulting and brokerage firm 
the trust and professional services departments were used as the reporting unit for the intangible assets related to acquisition of customer lists and a management contract 
milne scali was used as the reporting unit for goodwill and other intangible assets related to all insurance acquisitions 
the company uses current  comparable transactions to estimate the fair value of the respective reporting units when available 
the company calculates an estimated fair value based on multiples of revenues  earnings  and book value of the comparable transactions 
however  when such comparable transactions are not available or may have become outdated  the company uses other methods to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
these other methods may include the discounted cash flow approach  the same methodology used to establish the initial purchase price or the average of several methods 
assessing impairment of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets is an inexact science and can be approached using a variety of methods 
specific factors and rates used to assess value are based on management s best estimates of variables affecting the valuation analyses 
the estimates are assessed periodically and any identified impairment would result in a change to earnings 
such charges could materially affect the company s results of operations due to the significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets that must be assessed periodically or when impairment indicators are present 
the effect of any impairment is recorded in earnings in the period it is determined

interest rate risk can result from repricing risk timing differences in the maturity repricing of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts  options risk the effect of embedded options  such as loan prepayments  interest rate caps floors  and deposit withdrawals  basis risk risk resulting from unexpected changes in the spread between two or more different rates of similar maturity  and the resulting impact on the behavior of lending and funding rates  and yield curve risk risk resulting from unexpected changes in the spread between two or more rates of different maturities from the same type of instrument 
we have risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
to date we have not conducted trading activities as a means of managing interest rate risk 
our asset liability management process is utilized to manage our interest rate risk 
the measurement of interest rate risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
our interest rate risk exposure is actively managed with the objective of managing the level and potential volatility of net interest income in addition to the long term growth of equity  bearing in mind that we will always be in the business of taking on rate risk and that rate risk immunization is not entirely possible 
also  it is recognized that as exposure to interest rate risk is reduced  so too may the overall level of net interest income and equity 
in general  the assets and liabilities generated through ordinary business activities do not naturally create offsetting positions with respect to repricing or maturity characteristics 
access to the derivatives market can be an important element in maintaining our interest rate risk position within policy guidelines 
using derivative instruments  principally interest rate floors and caps  the interest rate sensitivity of specific transactions  as well as pools of assets or liabilities  is adjusted to maintain the desired interest rate risk profile 
see loan portfolio interest rate caps and floors borrowings interest rate caps and floors and notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item for a summary of our accounting policies pertaining to such instruments 
our primary tool for measuring and managing interest rate risk is net interest income simulation 
this exercise includes our assumptions regarding the level of interest rates and their impact on our current balance sheet 
interest rate caps and floors are included to the extent that they are exercised in the month simulation period 
additionally  changes in prepayment behavior of the residential mortgage  cmos  and mortgage backed securities portfolios in each rate environment are captured using industry estimates of prepayment speeds for various coupon segments of the portfolio 
for purposes of this simulation  projected month end balances of the various balance sheet accounts are held constant at their december  levels 
cash flows from a given account are reinvested back into the same account so as to keep the month end balance constant at its december  level 
the static balance sheet assumption is made so as to project the interest rate risk to net interest income embedded in the existing balance sheet 
with knowledge of the balance sheet s existing net interest income profile  more informed strategies and tactics may be developed as it relates to the structure mix of growth 
we monitor the results of net interest income simulation on a quarterly basis at regularly scheduled alco meetings 
each quarter net interest income is generally simulated for the upcoming month horizon in seven interest scenarios 
the scenarios generally modeled are parallel interest ramps of bp  bp  and bp along with a rates unchanged scenario 
the parallel movement of interest rates means all projected market interest rates move up or down by the same amount 
a ramp in interest rates means that the projected change in market interest rates occurs over the month horizon on a pro rata basis 
for example  in the bp scenario  the projected prime rate will increase from its starting point at december  of percent to percent months later 
the prime rate in this example will increase th of the overall increase of basis points each month 
given the historically low absolute level of market interest rates as of december   the declining rate scenario analysis was limited to bp and bp for the summary table presented below and a bp scenario was added 
as the yield curve flattened over the course of with short term rates increasing more than long term rates  the parallel movement of interest rates takes the level of the year us treasury note yield in the bp scenario to percent 
this is nearly bp below the june  low for the year us treasury note yield of percent 
therefore  the level of mortgage prepayment activity built into the model is significantly greater than the record levels experienced during the lows in mortgage rates 
the net interest income simulation result for the month horizon that covers the calendar year of is shown below 
the impact of each interest rate scenario on projected net interest income is displayed before and after the impact of the million cumulative notional original five year interest rate cap positions on three month libor with a percent strike 
these interest rate caps had a remaining maturity of approximately months as of december  the impact of the cap positions is calculated by determining the fair value of the contracts at the end of the month horizon using an interest rate option valuation model 
the change in fair value plus any expected cash flow in the various rate scenarios is summed to determine the total net benefit cost of the portfolio of interest rate cap contracts

these contracts will expire in may and june of see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item for further information on accounting policies related to derivative financial investments 
our rate sensitivity position over the projected month horizon is asset sensitive 
this is evidenced by the projected increase in net interest income in the rising interest rate scenarios 
because one of the objectives of asset liability management is to manage net interest income over a one year planning horizon  policy guidelines are stated in terms of maximum potential reduction in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates over the month period 
it is no less important  however  to give attention to the absolute dollar level of projected net interest income over the month period 
our general policy is to limit the percentage decrease in projected net interest income to   and percent from the rates unchanged scenario for the bp  bp  bp and bp interest rate ramp scenarios  respectively 
when a given scenario falls outside of these limits  such as is the case with the bp and bp scenarios above  the alco reviews the circumstances surrounding the exception and  considering the level of net interest income generated in the scenario and other related factors  may approve the exception to the general policy or recommend actions aimed at bringing the respective scenario within the general limits noted above 
a targeted level of net interest income is established and approved by the board and alco 
this target is reevaluated and reset as appropriate at each quarterly alco meeting 
static gap analysis is another tool that may be used for interest rate risk measurement 
the net differences between the amount of assets  liabilities  equity and off balance sheet instruments repricing within a cumulative calendar period is typically referred to as the rate sensitivity position or gap position 
the following table sets forth our rate sensitivity position as of december  assets and liabilities are classified by the earliest possible repricing date or maturity  whichever occurs first interest sensitivity gap analysis estimated maturity or repricing at december  over months months years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets interest bearing deposits with banks investment securities      frb and fhlb stock   loans held for sale  fixed rate 
loans held for sale  floating rate    loans held for investment  fixed rate      loans held for investment  floating rate    total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities interest checking and money market accounts   savings   time deposits under      time deposits  and over 
     short term borrowings   fhlb advances     long term borrowings    subordinated debentures   total interest bearing liabilities      interest rate gap     cumulative interest rate gap at december      cumulative interest rate gap to total assets investment securities are generally reported in the timeframe representing the earliest of repricing date  call date for callable securities  estimated life or maturity date 
estimated lives of mortgage backed securities and cmos are based on published industry prepayment estimates for securities with comparable weighted average interest rates and contractual maturities 
loans are stated gross of the allowance for credit losses and are placed in the earliest timeframe in which maturity or repricing may occur 
the table assumes that all savings and interest bearing demand deposits reprice in the earliest period presented  however  we believe a significant portion of these accounts constitute a core component and are generally not rate sensitive 
our position is supported by the fact that aggressive reductions in interest rates paid on these deposits historically have not caused notable reductions in balances 
for example  while the federal funds target rate increased basis points during the second half of  the rates paid on these deposits were only increased slightly  without any noticeable reductions in balances 
the table does not necessarily indicate the future impact of general interest rate movements on our net interest income because the repricing of certain assets and liabilities is discretionary and is subject to competitive and other pressures 
as a result  assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels 
static gap analysis does not fully capture the impact of embedded options  lagged interest rate changes  administered interest rate products  or certain off balance sheet sensitivities to interest rate movements 
therefore  this tool generally cannot be used in isolation to determine the level of interest rate risk exposure in banking institutions 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  these analyses are not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of changes in market interest rates such as those indicated above on the company 
further  these analyses are based on our assets and liabilities as of december  without forward adjustments for planned growth and anticipated business activities and do not contemplate any actions we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates
