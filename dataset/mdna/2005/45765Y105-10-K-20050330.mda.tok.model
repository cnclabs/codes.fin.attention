item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed in cautionary statements regarding forward looking information and elsewhere in this report 
page of the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in the company s statements of operations as a percentage of total net sales 
year ended december net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling marketing general and administrative impairment of goodwill total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense net income loss critical accounting policies our discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
during the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  and stock based compensation expense 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from insignia popsigns ratably over the period of service  which is either a two week or four week display cycle 
we recognize revenue related to equipment  software and sign card sales at the time the products are shipped to customers 
revenue associated with maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
revenue that has been billed and not yet recognized is reflected as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance is established for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company  the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole and other relevant facts and circumstances 
unexpected changes in the aforementioned factors could result in materially different amounts 
income taxes 
the company records income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is established when management determines it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is not realizable in the foreseeable future 
at december   all of the company s net deferred tax assets page of were offset with a valuation allowance  which amounted to million 
the company cannot be certain that it will be more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized in future years 
accrued retailer guarantees 
the company has contracts with many retailers that provide for the retailer to be paid on a per sign basis for the services rendered by the retailer to hang the company s popsigns in their respective stores 
some of the retailer contracts provide for minimum annual payment amounts 
if those minimum levels are not met based upon the annual activity with those retailers  the company is obligated to pay the contractual difference to the retailers 
excess amounts to be paid are computed and recorded on a monthly basis and paid on either a quarterly basis or annual basis 
these amounts are included as expense within cost of services and thus affect the company s gross profit margin 
stock based compensation 
the company accounts for employee stock based compensation under the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as opposed to the fair value method prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
pursuant to the provisions of apb  the company generally does not record an expense for the value of stock based awards granted to employees 
on december   the fasb issued an amendment to sfas no 
 share based payment  sfas no 
r  which will be effective for public companies in periods beginning after june  we are required to implement the proposed standard no later than the quarter that begins july  sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
companies are required to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions 
current estimates of option values using the black scholes method may not be indicative of results from valuation methodologies ultimately adopted by us 
we expect to continue to grant stock based compensation to employees  and the adoption of the new standard will have a material impact on our future results of operations 
acquisition in december  the company acquired all of the assets comprising the valustix business from paul a 
richards  inc  a new york company par  for  in cash  plus a five year royalty based on annual net sales over a threshold amount  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement between the company and par 
the company was not successful in integrating the valustix business into the pops program during and based on a number of factors and therefore made a decision to de emphasize that business 
utilizing discounted cash flows to determine the fair value of the valustix business  the company determined that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeded the fair value of the business 
as a result  the company wrote off the goodwill associated with the acquisition in the fourth quarter of and second quarter of the primary factor leading to the impairment was the continued inability of the valustix acquisition to generate positive cash flow from operations 
as of december   there is no goodwill remaining associated with the valustix acquisition
