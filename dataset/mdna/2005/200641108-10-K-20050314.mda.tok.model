in evaluating the cumulative information in the following table  it should be noted that each year s amount includes the cumulative effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods 
this table does not present accident or policy year development data 
conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on the following table

included in our loss reserves are liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for environmental related claims such as oil spills  mold and lead paint 
we held reserves in the amount of  for lead paint related claims at december  our reserves for environmental claims such as oil spills and mold were  and  respectively  at december  these reserves have been established to cover claims for known losses 
because of our limited exposure to these types of claims  we believe they will not have a material impact on our financial position 
operating ratios loss and underwriting expense ratios 
loss and underwriting expense ratios are used to interpret the underwriting experience of property and casualty insurance companies on a statutory basis 
certain corporate expenses included in our loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs do not impact the statutory loss and lae ratio or the statutory underwriting ratio because they are not expenses borne by our insurance subsidiaries 
underwriting profit margins are reflected by the extent to which the sum of the loss and underwriting expense ratios  which we refer to as the combined ratio  is less than 
the combined ratio is considered the best simple index of current underwriting performance of an insurer 
the ratios which follow include lines of insurance other than automobile 
data for the property and casualty industry generally may not be directly comparable to our data 
this is because we conduct our business primarily in massachusetts  w here approximately of our direct premiums were written for the year ended december   and  secondly  we primarily write personal automobile insurance

investments investment income is an important source of revenue for us  and the return on our investment portfolio has a material effect on our net earnings 
our investment strategy emphasizes investment yield while maintaining investment quality 
the focus of our investment objectives continues to be maximizing after tax investment income through investing in high quality diversified investments structured to maximize after tax investment income while minimizing risk 
a secondary objective is to achieve above average after tax total return 
our funds are generally invested in securities with maturities intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims and meet other operating needs without the forced sale of investments

regulation our primary business is subject to extensive regulation 
in massachusetts  the commissioner of insurance is appointed by the governor and has broad authority 
the commissioner fixes maximum policy rates and establishes minimum agent commission levels on personal automobile insurance 
in addition  the commissioner grants and revokes licenses to write insurance  approves policy forms  sets reserve requirements  determines the form and content of statutory financial statements and establishes the type and character of portfolio investments 
the commissioner also approves company submissions regarding affinity group insurance programs and corresponding discounts along with safe driver deviations 
consequently  the policies and regulations set by the commissioner are an important element of writing insurance in massachusetts 
in states other than massachusetts  premium rates generally must be filed with  and approved by the commissioner of insurance in that part icular state 
in general  minimum commissions to agents are not set by the other state commissioners 
state insurance regulators are responsible for conducting periodic examinations of insurance companies 
massachusetts division of insurance regulations provide that insurance companies will be examined every five years or more frequently as deemed prudent by the commissioner 
california department of insurance regulations provide that insurance companies will be examined every three years 
ohio department of insurance regulations provide that insurance companies will be examined at least every five years 
both commerce and citation are currently being examined for the five year period ended december  commerce west was last examined in by the california department of insurance for the four year period ended december  american commerce was examined in by the ohio department of insurance for the five year period ended december  these examinations have produced no material findings 
at the state level  various forms of automobile insurance reform are continuously debated 
in massachusetts  for example  new regulations and legislation are often proposed with the goal of reducing the need for premium increases for car deficit sharing 
as discussed elsewhere in this form k  the commissioner adopted regulations on december  that  if implemented  would effect a material change in the massachusetts automobile insurance market for risks that an insurer perceives to be under priced 
these regulations would create an assigned risk plan to replace the current loss pooling reinsurance arrangement under car 
on february   a massachusetts court stayed the implementation of the regulations until a court decides whether the commissioner has the legal authority to unilaterally implement them without legislative action 
although the us federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry  federal initiatives often have an impact on the industry 
proposed legislation currently exists in congress  the state modernization and regulatory transparency smart act  which would force states to comply with uniform standards and resolve disputes  speed up the process of getting new products to the market and move toward a system of market based rates 
congress and certain federal agencies continue to investigate the current condition of the insurance industry  encompassing both life and health and property and casualty insurance  in the united states in order to decide whether some form of federal role in the regulation of insurance companies would be appropriate 
congress conducts hearings relating  in general  to the solvency of insurers and has proposed federal legislation from time to time on this and other subjects 
the terrorism risk insurance act of established a temporary federal program that provides a system of shared public and private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism 
due to the types of coverage offered by us and the limited exposure we have outside of massachusetts  the act s financial impact upon us has been immaterial 
new york attorney general eliot spitzer and his staff have been challenging two separate but related insurance industry practices fraudulent bid fixing and certain contingent commission payments 
mr 
spitzer and his staff have taken legal action against several companies as a result of these challenges 
no such action has been taken against us or any of our subsidiaries  nor do we expect any such action to occur 
automobile insurance regulation overview 
massachusetts has required compulsory automobile insurance coverage since states other than massachusetts generally have varying levels of minimum compulsory insurance 
under current law  all massachusetts motorists are required to carry certain minimum coverages mandated by the state 
the commissioner fixes and establishes  among other things  the maximum rates insurers may charge for the compulsory personal automobile coverages 
with very limited exceptions  each servicing carrier writing automobile insurance in massachusetts must accept all risks submitted to the servicing carrier for the compulsory coverage  but is permitted to reinsure these risks including affinity group marketing insurance risks through car 
compulsory coverage 
compulsory coverage includes no fault coverage  limited bodily injury coverage  property damage coverage and coverage against uninsured or hit and run motorists 
the massachusetts no fault statute provides for personal injury protection coverage  which entitles a party to be reimbursed directly by the party s own insurer for certain medical expenses  lost wages and other defined expenses arising from an automobile accident  up to a specific amount  even if another party caused the accident 
rates and commissions 
massachusetts personal automobile insurance rates are fixed and established annually by the commissioner 
affinity group marketing insurance programs and safe driver rate deviations must be annually approved by the commissioner 
we set our voluntary massachusetts commercial automobile insurance rates competitively  subject to the commissioner s authority to disapprove such rates 
car files the rate for commercial automobile risks reinsured through car  subject to the authority of the commissioner to disapprove the rates  except for private passenger type non fleet business which is filed by insurance companies and approved by the commissioner 
for additional information  see commonwealth automobile reinsurers 
massachusetts personal automobile premiums charged to a policyholder are adjusted based upon the safe driver rating of the operator 
moving violations and at fault accidents affect each driver s safe driver rating 
in addition  the extra risk rating regulations permit insurers to deny coverage or charge surcharged rates for physical damage coverage to both high risk vehicles and insureds with excessive prior loss or violation activity 
the commissioner sets an average minimum direct agency commission rate for personal automobile insurance 
with respect to risks reinsured through car  the maximum amount of commissions that car will reimburse  as part of their expense allowance structure  is fixed at that prescribed rate 
other than massachusetts rates and commissions are set competitively on a company by company and state by state basis 
mandatory underwriting 
massachusetts law specifies that all individuals holding a valid driver s license be entitled to purchase the mandatory automobile insurance coverages regardless of their driving experience or accident record 
massachusetts law also places certain restraints on insurers discretion to refuse to renew automobile insurance policies 
policyholders are generally entitled to renew except in cases of fraud  material misrepresentation  revocation or suspension of an operator s license or nonpayment of premiums 
with very limited exceptions  servicing carriers that participate in car in massachusetts must accept every automobile risk submitted to them 
under the massachusetts system of rate regulation  some personal automobile insurance risks are purposefully under priced by the commissioner  and therefore  absent state intervention  insurers would not ordinarily choose to write those risks 
the car reinsurance program described below is intended to mitigate the burden imposed by the massachusetts take all comers system  by allowing insurers to transfer the exposure for under priced risks to an industry pool  and by granting participation credits for certain under priced risks 
these credits are required by statute 
commonwealth automobile reinsurers 
car is a massachusetts state mandated reinsurance mechanism  under which all premiums  expenses and losses on ceded business are pooled and shared by all insurers 
it is similar to a joint underwriting association because a number of insurers participate in the program 
as of december   insurers were servicing carriers for the commercial automobile line of business  some of which participated in the personal automobile line 
there were a total of companies  including commerce  that were servicing carriers for the personal auto pool 
in general  agencies licensed to issue automobile insurance policies are entitled to be assigned to at least one servicing carrier 
there are two categories of agencies those that have voluntary agreements with one or more servicing carriers  and those that do not 
the latter are assigned by car  generally to a single servicing carrier and are known as erps 
there can be erps for private passenger automobile or commercial automobile or both 
an insurer may terminate its participation in car by surrendering  for example  its license to write automobile policies in massachusetts 
termination does not discharge or otherwise affect liability of an insurer incurred prior to termination 
a withdrawing insurer is assessed a share of car s projected deficits for future years based on the insurer s prior years participation in car 
the assessment paid by the withdrawing insurer is redistributed to the remaining insurers based on their participation ratios 
an insurer can transfer its obligations for its personal insurance policies to another insurer who formally agrees to assume these obligations 
the transferring insurer is thereby relieved of future car obligations which otherwise would have arisen as a consequence of the business transferred 
as previously noted  additional information about car  including regulatory reform  is in item of this form k 
insurance holding company structure 
as an insurance holding company  we are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company statutes of the states in which our subsidiary insurance companies are incorporated 
because our subsidiaries are members of an insurance holding company system  they are required to register with their respective divisions of insurance and to submit reports describing the capital structure  general financial condition  ownership and management of each insurer and any person or entity controlling the insurer  the identity of every member of the insurance holding company system  and the material outstanding transactions between the insurer and its affiliates 
california and ohio have insurance holding company laws similar to those in massachusetts 
each member of the insurance holding company system must keep current the information required to be disclosed by reporting all material changes or additions within days of the end of the month in which it learns of such change or addition 
massachusetts law prohibits a party that is not a domestic insurer from acquiring control of a domestic insurer or of a company controlling a domestic insurer without prior approval of the commissioner 
control is presumed to exist if a party directly or indirectly holds  owns or controls ten percent or more of the voting stock of another party  but may be rebutted by showing that control does not exist 
california and ohio have laws similar to those in massachusetts 
in the event of the insolvency  liquidation or other reorganization of any of our insurance subsidiaries  our creditors and stockholders will have no right to proceed against the assets of those subsidiaries  or to cause the liquidation or bankruptcy of any company under federal or state bankruptcy laws 
state laws govern such liquidation or rehabilitation proceedings and the division of insurance would act as receiver for the particular company 
creditors and policyholders of the insurance subsidiaries would be entitled to payment in full from such assets before a stockholder  such as commerce holdings in our case  would be entitled to receive any distribution therefrom 
payment of dividends 
under massachusetts law  an insurer may pay cash dividends only from earnings and statutory surplus  and the insurer s remaining surplus must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate in relation to its financial needs 
following the declaration and payment of such dividends  the insurer must file a report with the commissioner 
a massachusetts insurance company may not pay an extraordinary dividend or distribution unless the insurer gives the commissioner at least days prior notice of the declaration and the commissioner does not disapprove of the plan of payment prior to the date of such payment 
an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution whose fair market value together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months exceeds the greater of of surplus  or net income for the month period ending the st day of d ecember 
california and ohio have laws similar to those in massachusetts regulating the payment of dividends by insurance companies 
the aggregate amount of dividends calculated in accordance with regulations in massachusetts  california and ohio that could have been paid in from all of our insurance subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval was approximately million  of which million was declared and paid during protection against insurer insolvency 
all insurance companies are required to participate in insurance insolvency fund programs in the states in which they write 
for further information  please refer to note l to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
national association of insurance commissions guidelines 
the naic insurance regulatory information system  or iris  was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is intended primarily to assist state insurance regulators in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies eleven industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure from the usual values on four or more of the ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance commissioners as to certain aspects of an insurer s business 
for the year ended december   our consolidated property and casualty operations had no ratios outside the usual values 
in order to enhance the regulation of insurer insolvency  the naic developed a formula and model law to provide for risk based capital  or rbc  requirements for property and casualty insurance companies 
the model law has since been adopted in all states 
rbc requirements are designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations 
the rbc model for property and casualty insurance companies measures three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers underwriting  which encompasses the risk of adverse loss development and inadequate pricing  declines in asset values arising from credit risk  and  other business risks from investments 
insurers having less statutory surplus than required by the rbc calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action  depending on the level of capital inadequacy 
the rbc model formula proposes four levels of regulatory action 
the extent of regulatory intervention and action increases as the percentage of surplus to rbc falls 
the first level  defined by the naic as the company action level  requires an insurer to submit a plan of corrective actions to the regulator if surplus falls below of the rbc amount 
as indicated in the following table  the rbc level of each of our insurance subsidiaries at december  significantly exceeds the rbc level requirements 
commerce citation american commerce commerce west statutory surplus rbc company action level statutory surplus in excess of rbc company action level rbc amounts percent of surplus to rbc amounts competition the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  characterized by periods of increasing premium rates and limited underwriting capacity  followed by periods of intensive price competition and abundant underwriting capacity 
this industry also is highly competitive  with a large number of companies  many of which operate in more than one state  offering automobile  homeowners  commercial property and other lines of insurance 
some of our competitors have larger volumes of business and greater financial resources than we have and some sell insurance directly to policyholders rather than through independent agents 
massachusetts 
our insurance products are marketed exclusively through independent agencies  including erps 
because most of our voluntary agencies represent more than one company  we face competition within each of these agencies 
we compete for business within independent agencies by offering a more attractively priced product through our aaa discount to the consumer and by paying agents significant compensation in the form of commissions and profit sharing 
we also seek to provide a consistent market  prompt servicing of policyholder claims and effective agency support services 
we have agreed that we shall be the aaa clubs exclusive underwriter of massachusetts personal automobile group programs  and we have a rolling three year contract with the aaa clubs 
this contract automatically renews annually and may be terminated upon a minimum of two years written notice to us 
we believe that the massachusetts regulatory environment has discouraged certain companies with more traditional underwriting and pricing approaches from establishing a presence or expanding their market share in massachusetts 
we believe that proposed changes to car rules and the massachusetts personal auto system reflect a desire expressed by the commissioner and the massachusetts governor to change the massachusetts system for regulating automobile insurance to one that is more in line with the rest of the country 
in april  the governor appointed a task force to review potential changes to the system that are intended to increase competition 
any material change in this situation could adversely affect our business 
for additional information  see massachusetts personal automobile insurance in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this form k 
other states 
we compete with various regional and domestic insurers  national agency companies and direct writers 
any of these competitors could undertake actions that could adversely affect our profitability  such as pricing automobile insurance premiums more aggressively or offering greater compensation to independent agencies

however  our success could be significantly affected by factors over which we have limited or no control 
for example we are primarily a personal automobile insurance carrier  and therefore our business may be adversely affected by conditions in this industry 
we write a substantial portion of our business in massachusetts  and therefore our business may be adversely affected by conditions and adverse legislative  judicial or regulatory decisions in massachusetts 
our financial performance may be adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic losses 
if we are not able to attract and retain independent agents  it could adversely affect our business 
if our affinity relationship with the aaa clubs of massachusetts were to be terminated  we would lose a significant avenue for offering affinity discounts  and our sales of personal automobile insurance products would likely decline  which would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
if american commerce s relationship with one or more large aaa clubs terminates  then american commerce would lose a substantial portion of its business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
established competitors with greater resources may make it difficult for us to market our products effectively and offer our products at a profit 
we are subject to comprehensive regulation by massachusetts as well as the other states in which we operate  and our ability to earn profits may be restricted by changes to these regulations 
new claim  coverage and regulatory issues in the insurance industry may adversely affect us 
regulatory changes to enhance competition or reform car in massachusetts could adversely affect our participation in car  market share and profitability 
these include changes to car rules and  which deal with participation  credits and penalties 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information 
market fluctuations and changes in interest rates have had  and may continue to have  significant and negative effects on our investment portfolio 
we may not be able to alleviate risk through reinsurance arrangements successfully  which could cause us to reduce our premiums written in certain lines or could result in losses 
we rely on our information technology and telecommunication system and the failure of these systems could adversely affect our business

several erps and other massachusetts insurers have joined in challenging the new regulations 
on february   a massachusetts trial court stayed the implementation of the new rules until a court decides whether the new rules are consistent with massachusetts law 
we cannot predict whether the commissioner s efforts to reform the residual market system without legislative action will be successful  nor can we predict when this matter will be resolved

therefore  the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements in this form k 
business overview we provide personal and commercial property and casualty insurance primarily in massachusetts and in other states 
our core product lines are personal automobile  homeowners  and commercial automobile 
we market our products exclusively through our network of independent agents in all states  except california  where we use agents and brokers 
our primary business strategy is to focus on the personal automobile insurance market in massachusetts and to grow and diversify by increasing the proportion of our business written in other states in which we currently have a significant presence  primarily from commerce west and american commerce 
we manage our business in four reportable segments property and casualty insurance massachusetts  property and casualty insurance other than massachusetts  real estate and commercial lending  and corporate and other 
our ability to capitalize on our business strengths and implement our strategies is subject to particular risks 
for example  because we are primarily a personal automobile insurance carrier  adverse developments in this industry could negatively affect us more than insurers that are more diversified across multiple business lines 
additionally  the concentration of our business in massachusetts makes us more susceptible to any adverse development in the prevailing legislative  regulatory  economic  demographic  competitive and other conditions  including weather related events  and adverse judicial decisions in massachusetts  and could make it more costly or difficult for us to conduct our business 
our affinity group marketing programs provide members of participating groups and associations with a convenient means of purchasing discounted private passenger automobile insurance 
we would lose a significant avenue for offering our existing affinity group d iscounts and our sales of personal automobile and homeowner insurance products in massachusetts would likely decline if our affinity relationship with the aaa clubs of massachusetts is substantially changed or terminated and we are unable to devise and implement effective mitigation measures 
these aaa arrangements have rolling three year terms  and a massachusetts aaa club may terminate the agreement upon a minimum of two years written notice 
american commerce has relationships with various aaa clubs other than massachusetts  which are not subject to any minimum advance notice to terminate 
if american commerce s relationship with one or more large aaa clubs terminates  then american commerce would lose a substantial portion of its business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
commonwealth automobile reinsurers a significant aspect of our automobile insurance business relates to our interaction with commonwealth automobile reinsurers car 
car is a reinsurance mechanism mandated in massachusetts  which enables us and the other participating servicing carriers to reinsure any automobile risk that they perceive to be under priced 
since its inception  car has annually generated significant underwriting losses  primarily in the personal automobile pool 
all companies writing automobile insurance in massachusetts share in the underwriting results of car business for their respective product line or lines 
member companies of car have joint and several liabilities for the obligations of car 
if one member of car fails to pay its assessments  the remaining members of car will be required to pay the pro rata share of the member who fails to pay its obligations 
as of december   we were not aware of any car member company which has failed to meet its obligations 
car regulatory reform the massachusetts commissioner of insurance the commissioner adopted regulations new rules on december  enacting a wholesale change of the massachusetts involuntary private passenger motor vehicle insurance market from a loss sharing system to a risk sharing system 
the new rules would be implemented in two steps  including a transition phase followed by the adoption of the risk sharing system 
if the new rules became effective january   they would effect a material change in the massachusetts automobile insurance market for risks that are reinsured through the residual market known as car 
a stay has been issued by a massachusetts trial court  barring the implementation of the new rules until the court decides whether the new rules are consistent with massachusetts law 
while the new rules are stayed  car will operate in accordance with the rules that existed immediately prior to the commissioner s adoption of the new rules or any rules changes that may be permitted under the court imposed stay 
overview of the stayed new rules 
the transition phase of the new rules was schedule to begin january  and run through the focus of the transition phase is to effect a fundamental change in the allocation of so called high loss ratio exclusive representative producers or erps 
an erp is a massachusetts automobile insurance agency that does not have a voluntary agency automobile insurance relationship with an insurer  and which is assigned by car to an insurer who is a servicing carrier 
in general  a high loss ratio erp is a subclass of erps composed of those erps with a loss ratio of or greater 
the primary transition phase elements in the new rules call for the current personal automobile residual market pool to be comprised of three components a pool of ceded business written  excluding the impact of the net rate subsidy described in below  through high loss ratio erps  a pool containing ceded business  excluding the impact of the net rate subsidy described in below  written through voluntary agents and erps that are not high loss ratio erps  and a pool comprised of the net ceded subsidies from the high loss ratio and non high loss ratio erps 
car would apportion the underwriting results of the high loss ratio erp pool among all insurers based on each insurer s voluntary agent market share on june  the car residual market deficit from ceded business written through voluntary agents and erps that are not high loss ratio erps would be allocated based on the market share of those agents  modified by a company s utilization of car 
the results from the subsidy pool  which replaces the current system of car credits  would be allocated based on each individual company s net voluntary mix of subsidized and rate redundant business as that relates to the mix of business written by the entire market 
the new rules would also require  for the period beginning january   that only companies with a september  market share of or more will remain as a servicing carrier for the business written by erps 
as part of these new rules  high loss ratio and non high loss ratio erps would be reapportioned amongst these servicing carriers so as to equalize the amount of erp business written by each servicing carrier in proportion with each servicing carrier s share of the total servicing carrier market 
lastly  the new rules would create the assigned risk plan for certain eligible business  entitled the massachusetts automobile insurance plan the maip  beginning in for certain new business  for certain renewal business and ultimately for all business in the new rules approved by the commissioner for the maip  along with the related transition rules  can be found under the section titled decision and order on changes to rules of operation  through  and  and rules through located at the massachusetts division of insurance website address http www

although the new rules have been stayed by the court  we have estimated their impact in the event that the stay is lifted and the new rules are implemented retroactive to january  we believe that the decreased cession penalties contained within the new rules could substantially increase the amount of business ceded to car 
it is impossible for us to estimate  however  either the extent of the increase in the volume of business ceded to car or the resulting impact on the residual marketplace 
consequently  our pro forma estimate does not include this probable effect nor changes in cession behavior that could occur 
while we believe it is premature to estimate the impact of the new rules on our future financial results  we have estimated the effect the new rules would have had if they had been in effect for the car policy year  which is the most recent policy year for which substantially complete car data is available 
based upon our analysis of the stayed new rules  we estimate that commerce s increased share of the residual market deficit would amount to an additional pre tax car expense between million and million for car policy year  which utilizes a participation ratio for the high loss ratio pool of 
the pre tax effect would partially impact fiscal and fully impact fiscal the ranges provided are indicative of varying car cession strategies that may have been utilized by us for the high loss ratio erps that would have been assigned to us under the reapportionment described above 
our participation ratio for the high loss ratio pool is approximately and a proportional increase in our pro forma estimate for and beyond could be expected based on increases in our market share 
lastly  due to the estimated increased car expenses for policy year  we expect that our agent profit sharing expenses would decline between million and million  which would partially impact fiscal and fully impact fiscal comparison to prior pro forma estimate 
the above amounts are significantly different from the amounts we previously published in our october estimate of car reform because the new rules differ substantially from the rules approved by car at that time  primarily in three ways 
first  the october rules called for much higher expense reimbursements for business serviced by the servicing carriers versus the new rules 
secondly  it appeared that all the high loss ratio erp business would be required to be ceded to car under the october rules 
lastly  only six servicing carriers were required under the october rules versus under the new rules 
impact of stayed new rules for 
while the new rules are stayed  car will operate under the rules that existed immediately prior to the commissioner s adoption of the new rules or as rule changes are permitted 
a company s participation ratio in car s deficit is directly affected by the business it keeps voluntarily  as well as what it cedes to car 
the values associated with credits as a result of voluntary retentions and penalties for ceding under existing car rules are set annually but have not yet been established and approved by the commissioner for until these values are known  we cannot predict the resulting impact on the car deficit for  or the impact on our participation ratio 
if significant changes are made to these values from those established for  companies could cede significantly larger amounts of business to car  thereby increasing the overall car deficit and our participation ratio could also significantly increa se 
if this were to happen  we could be faced with significantly higher car costs in as compared to we cannot predict whether the court will permit the commissioner to implement the new rules and  if so  whether the new rules would become effective retroactively to january  as proposed  nor can we predict when this matter will be resolved 
as such  we cannot predict whether the new rules will affect our competitive position or financial performance other than as described above 
we intend to review and  if necessary  revise our business strategies in response to the above information 
recent development on february   american commerce received notification from one of its agents  aaa arizona  inc  that it intends to stop writing new business with american commerce effective immediately and indicated that it intends to transfer all of its existing business from american commerce 
aaa arizona was american commerce s largest agent in terms of direct written premium produced  having generated  in direct written premium in  representing of american commerce s total direct written premium and of our consolidated total direct written premium 
american commerce will continue to write business in arizona but will no longer market its products through aaa arizona 
commerce west began writing business in arizona through independent agencies in early at this time  we are not able to estimate the impact of these events on our arizona writings 
our revenues and expenses our revenue principally reflects earned premiums  consisting of premiums that we receive from sales by our agents of property and casualty insurance policies  primarily personal automobile  homeowners and commercial automobile  which we refer to as direct premiums written  plus premiums we receive from insurance policies that we assume  primarily from car  which we refer to as assumed premiums  less the portion of our premiums that is ceded to car and other reinsurers  which we refer to as ceded premiums  less the change in the portion of premiums that will not be recognized as income for accounting purposes until a future period  which we refer to as unearned premiums  investment income that we earn on our invested assets  premium finance charges and service fee income that we earn in connection with the billing and deferral of premium payments  and realized investment gains and losses 
our expenses principally reflect incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses which we sometimes refer to as lae  including estimates for losses incurred during the period but not yet reported to us and changes in estimates from prior periods related to direct and assumed business  less the portion of those incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses that are ceded to other insurers  and policy acquisition costs  including agent compensation and general and administrative costs  such as salaries and benefits  and advertising that are not deferred for accounting purposes to a future period 
our critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies  which are especially dependent upon our judgments and estimates  to be critical to the preparation of our financial statements 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses represents our best estimate of the ultimate net cost of all loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred after reinsurance and amounts estimated to be recoverable through salvage and subrogation 
the estimate for ultimate net cost of all losses incurred through the balance sheet date includes the adjusted case estimates for losses  incurred but not reported ibnr losses  salvage and subrogation recoverable and a reserve for lae 
in arriving at our best estimate  we begin with the aggregate of individual case reserves and then make adjustments to these amounts on a line of business basis 
these adjustments to the aggregate case reserves by line of business are made based on analyses performed by us as further described below 
the entire liability for unpaid losses and lae is also separately reviewed quarterly and annually by our actuarial department 
liabil ity estimates are continually analyzed and updated  and therefore  the ultimate liability may be more or less than the current estimate 
the effects of changes in the estimates are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimates are revised 
the claim cycle begins when a claim is reported to us and claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of our exposure without regard to injury causality  third party liability or potential recoveries 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon an evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding the claim and the policy provisions relating to the loss 
this estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel adjusting the claim 
during the loss adjustment period  these case basis estimates are revised as deemed necessary by our claims department personnel based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the claim 
in accordance with industry practice  we also maintain reserves for estimated ibnr  salvage and subrogation recoverable and lae 
these reserves are determined based on historical information and our experience 
adjustments to these reserves are made periodically to take into account changes in the volume of policies written  claims frequency  severity and payment patterns  the mix of business  claims processing and other items that can be expected to affect our liability for losses and lae over time 
when reviewing the liability for unpaid losses and lae  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of various factors such as payment trends  loss expense per exposure  our historical loss experience and that of the industry  frequency and severity trends  and legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation and recession 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is no precise method  however  for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual development of reserves is affected by many factors  as noted above 
we determine our net liability estimate for losses and lae by using individual estimates of reported claims adjusted for our best estimate by line of business and a review of these results by our actuarial area using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques 
after taking into account all relevant factors  we believe that  based on existing information  the provision for losses and lae at december  is adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses and claims incurred as of that date 
the ultimate liability  however  may be greater or lower than established reserves 
if the ultimate payment is greater than or less than our estimated liability for losses and lae  we will incur additional expense or income  as appropriate  which may have a material impact on our results of operations 
our financial management personnel calculates our estimate independently from those amounts calculated by our actuaries  and therefore  the final results are usually different 
we estimate our amounts primarily by reviewing historical loss and lae data  focusing mainly on payment data 
we also review and compare the most recent loss frequency  severity  and payment data to historical trends in an attempt to determine if patterns are remaining consistent or not 
we attempt to establish our reserve estimate as close as possible to the amount required for the ultimate future payments necessary to settle all losses 
our aggregate actuarial estimate for the loss and lae reserves  on a consolidated basis and net of reinsurance recoverable  ranges from a low of million to a high of million  as of december  our financial statement loss and lae reserves net of reinsurance  based on our best estimate  was established at million for that date 
investments and other than temporary impairments 
the carrying values of investments in fixed maturities  which include taxable and non taxable bonds  and investments in common and preferred stocks  are derived from market prices supplied by our investment custodian  or when no price is provided by the custodian  we obtain a third party valuation 
fair market value of fixed maturities and equity securities is based on quoted market prices 
for other investments  fair value equals quoted market price  if available 
unrealized investment gains and losses on common and preferred stocks and fixed maturities  to the extent that there is no other than temporary impairment of value  are credited or charged  net of any tax effect  to a separate component of stockholders equity  known as net accumulated other comprehensive income loss  until realized 
we review all security holdings on a quarterly basis for potential other than temporary impairments due to declines in market value in accordance with gaap 
as part of this process  we consider any significant market declines in the context of the overall market and also in relation to the outlook for the specific issuer of the security and the issuer s industry 
each quarter  we review all securities whose market values have declined below book price 
from a quantitative standpoint  we view all securities that have declined more than below book price and have remained so for two consecutive quarters as potentially in need of a write down 
any other security that we view as impaired for a significant period of time is also a candidate for a write down  even if the percentage decline is less than 
in addition  we perform the following quarterly impairment review of our portfolio we review all holdings with an unrealized loss of over  or more than below cost 
we review all holdings with unrealized losses over  or more than below cost  for securities at a continuous loss position period of to months 
we review all securities that have been at a continuous loss position for months or more 
we review both issue specific data and general market data for all perpetual preferred stocks that have been at a continuous loss position for over months 
generally  we consider all aaa aa rated us government securities with market values less than cost as temporarily impaired due to our intent and ability to hold these securities to recovery 
we consider market activity between our quarter end date and earnings release date in our evaluation 
if a security is deemed other than temporarily impaired  we adjust the security s cost basis to market value through realized loss based on publicly available prices or  in the absence of such information  on a price supplied by a broker 
there is a risk that we may assess an other than temporary decline in market value as being temporary and  consequently  not charge the impairment to our earnings  which could have a significant impact on our future earnings and financial position 
our net earnings in recent years have been significantly affected by our ownership interests in several closed end preferred stock mutual funds that we were required to account for using the equity method of accounting 
for our investment in any fund in which we own or more of the fund s shares  the equity method of accounting requires us to categorize as a realized investment gain or loss the change in the net asset value of that fund from the beginning of the current fiscal year 
our investment in these funds has had a material effect on our realized gains and losses in recent years and may have caused our net earnings to be more volatile than those of similar companies 
during  we decreased our ownership below in all but one closed end preferred stock mutual fund 
at december   we continued to have only one closed end preferred stock mutual fund in which we owned more than 
massachusetts personal automobile insurance overview 
we have been the largest writer of personal property and casualty insurance in massachusetts in terms of market share of direct premiums written since our estimated share of the massachusetts personal automobile market increased to during the eleven months ended november   significantly exceeding our two nearest competitors  safety insurance group  inc and arbella insurance group  who maintained an estimated and market share  respectively 
in massachusetts  private passenger automobile insurance is subject to extensive regulation 
owners of automobiles are generally required to demonstrate certain minimum automobile insurance coverages as a prerequisite to registering any automobile 
with very limited exceptions  private passenger automobile insurers are required by law to issue a policy to any applicant seeking to obtain such coverages  commonly known as the take all comers law 
marketing and underwriting strategies for companies operating in massachusetts are limited by maximum premium rates and minimum agency commission levels for personal automobile insurance  both of which are mandated by the commissioner 
changes in premium rates 
during the three year period from to  average mandated massachusetts personal automobile insurance premium rates increased an average of per year 
coinciding with the rate decision  the commissioner also approved a increase in the commission agents receive for selling private passenger automobile insurance for the following table shows the state mandated average rate change  the actual average revenue change per exposure and our average revenue change per exposure as estimated for and for the three previous years in massachusetts 
year state mandated average rate change actual state average revenue change per exposure commerce average revenue change per exposure estimated for actual state and commerce average revenue change per exposure 
based on massachusetts division of insurance filings 
although mandated average personal automobile premium rates increased in  our average revenue per exposure increased 
we believe that the relative increase for as compared to the commissioner s state mandated average rate resulted primarily from the fact that our mix of personal automobile coverage differs from that of the industry  and changes to our distribution of risks by class  territory and coverage  including changes resulting from the purchase of new  more expensive automobiles  which were not factored into the commissioner s rate increase 
the actual state average revenue change per exposure represents the change in the average premium paid by drivers in massachusetts  as opposed to the state mandated average rate change 
as can be seen above  our average revenue change per exposure corresponds more closely to the actual state average revenue change 
the reason for this is that both take into account newer vehicles  as compared to the state mandated average rate change  which does not 
affinity group marketing 
since  we have been a leader in affinity group marketing in massachusetts  through agreements with the three american automobile association clubs operating in massachusetts  offering discounts on private passenger automobile insurance to the clubs members who reside in the state 
a discount was approved by the commissioner for policies effective january  this same discount existed in based on information provided to us by the aaa clubs operating in massachusetts  we believe that membership in these clubs represents approximately one third of the massachusetts motoring public 
the following table presents total direct premiums written attributable to the aaa clubs group business in massachusetts for the years ended  and total aaa massachusetts direct premiums written percentage of total direct premiums written percentage of massachusetts direct personal automobile premiums written total aaa massachusetts exposures percentage of massachusetts exposures the decreasing percentages since are attributed to a higher rate of increase in non affinity group business and a slight decrease in aaa massachusetts exposures 
of the total massachusetts automobile exposures written through the aaa affinity group program by us in  approximately were written through insurance agencies owned by the aaa clubs of our total massachusetts automobile exposures 
the remaining of the aaa group program were written through our network of independent agents of our total massachusetts automobile exposures 
our performance measures we evaluate our operations by monitoring key measures of growth and profitability 
we measure our growth by examining our direct premiums written as well as increases in exposures and policies 
we generally measure our operating results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap by examining our net earnings  return on equity roe  and our loss and lae  underwriting expense and combined ratios on a consolidated basis 
our key measures include return on equity 
return on equity is net earnings divided by stockholders equity at the beginning of the period 
direct premiums written 
direct premiums written is the sum of the total policy premiums  net of cancellations  associated with policies underwritten and issued by our insurance subsidiaries 
we use direct premiums written  which includes premiums that we cede to car and other reinsurers  as a measure of the underlying growth of our insurance business from period to period 
direct earned premiums 
direct earned premiums are the portion of direct premiums written over the preceding twelve month period equal to the expired portion of policies and recognized as income during an accounting period 
investment income 
investment income represents earnings on our investment portfolio 
we rely on after tax investment income as a significant source of net earnings since we generally achieve a combined ratio see below of slightly less than loss and lae ratio 
the loss and lae ratio is the percentage of losses and loss adjustment expenses including corporate expenses incurred to earned premiums 
we calculate this ratio net of our reinsurance recoveries 
we use this ratio as a measure of the overall underwriting profitability of the insurance business we write and to assess the adequacy of our pricing 
underwriting expense ratio 
the underwriting expense ratio is the percentage of underwriting expenses including corporate expenses incurred to net premiums written 
underwriting expenses are the aggregate of policy acquisition costs  including commissions  and the portion of administrative  general and other expenses attributable to underwriting operations 
in addition  underwriting expenses are grossed up for any change in deferred acquisition costs 
combined ratio 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss and lae ratio and the underwriting expense ratio and measures a company s overall underwriting profit 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income  and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient 
we use the combined ratio in evaluating our overall underwriting profitability and for comparing our profitability to our competitors profitability 
results of operations our key operating measures for the years ended december   and follow dollars in millions  except earnings per share diluted earnings per share return on equity direct premiums written direct earned premiums net investment income underwriting expense ratio loss and lae ratio combined ratio year ended compared to year ended the significant increase in earnings and roe in over was primarily due to the decrease in our loss ratio 
we attribute the improvement in our loss ratio to several factors an increase in average earned premium revenue per automobile see discussion regarding premium results  a decrease in the current year personal automobile physical damage claim frequency  more favorable loss reserve development compared to  and improved results from car 
the effect of our improved loss ratio on earnings was partially offset by the increase in our underwriting ratio 
this increase was driven by a significant increase in our agents profit sharing expense in the increase in agents profit sharing expense is the result of substantially better underwriting results in than in the impact of our increased agents profit sharing expense on our underwriting ratio was partially offset by lower policy year mandated agency commission rates for massachusetts personal automobile policies 
the market price for our common stock and our financial results directly affects our expense related to stock options and book value awards bvas  respectively 
our stock option expense represents options granted to both employees and american commerce agents 
an increase in the market value of our stock will increase the expense we recognize for options subject to variable accounting 
similarly  an increase in our net income will increase the value of  and therefore the expense we recognize for  outstanding bvas 
we record these expenses in two separate line items on our income statement losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs 
the stock option and bva expenses recorded in each line item for the years ended and follow losses and loss adjustment expenses policy acquisition costs total stock option and bva expenses premium results direct premiums written and earned for the years ended and follow change change massachusetts direct premiums written personal automobile commercial automobile homeowners other lines massachusetts direct premiums written other than massachusetts direct premiums written personal automobile commercial automobile homeowners other lines other than massachusetts direct premiums written total direct premiums written massachusetts direct earned premiums personal automobile commercial automobile homeowners other lines massachusetts direct earned premiums other than massachusetts direct earned premiums personal automobile commercial automobile homeowners other lines other than massachusetts direct earned premiums total direct earned premiums massachusetts segment we experienced growth in direct premiums written in all of our insurance categories in massachusetts  with growth in personal automobile accounting for approximately of the segment s increase 
personal automobile business growth was a result of a increase in average written premium per written exposure coupled with a increase in the number of exposures written during our year to date homeowners growth was from a increase in average premium per policy coupled with a increase in the number of policies 
our year to date commercial automobile growth was from a increase in average premium per policy coupled with a increase in the number of policies 
other than massachusetts segment personal automobile and homeowners growth accounted for approximately of the increase in direct premiums written in states other than massachusetts 
the increase in personal automobile and homeowners business was primarily due to additional rate per policy  partially offset by a decrease in the number of policies 
the policy count decrease was primarily due to increased levels of competition  our desire to maintain appropriate underwriting results and withdrawal from several states as previously reported 
net investment income our net investment income for the year ended increased  or compared to net investment income is affected by the composition of our investment portfolio and yields on those investments 
the composition of our investment portfolio  at cost  at december  and follows of total of total fixed maturities a preferred stocks common stocks preferred stock mutual funds mortgages and collateral notes cash and cash equivalents other investments total investments a fixed maturities include gnma fnma mortgage backed bonds  corporate bonds  us treasury bonds and notes and tax exempt state and municipal bonds

the increase in invested assets is primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes in december and operating cash flows 
the decrease in yields is primarily due to the sale and redemption of higher yielding investment securities coupled with lower yields on new investments due primarily to tighter credit spreads 
pre tax and after tax yields remained consistent on a quarterly basis throughout realized investment gains and losses net realized investment gains losses for the years ended and follow change other than temporary impairment losses fixed maturity securities equity securities total other than temporary impairment losses transaction net gains losses fixed maturity securities equity securities venture capital funds other investments transaction net gains equity in earnings of closed end preferred stock mutual funds net realized investment gains included in net earnings our gains on investment securities were partially offset by write downs for other than temporary declines in the market value of certain fixed maturities  preferred stocks and common stocks totaling  and  for the years ended and  respectively 
the other than temporary write downs for the period consisted of  for eight municipal bonds   for sixteen corporate bonds and for four preferred stocks 
the other than temporary write downs for the period consisted of  for one municipal bond   for four corporate bonds   for three preferred stocks and for five common stocks 
the decrease in transaction net realized gains for the year ended is primarily due to lower portfolio turnover 
portfolio turnover was relatively high in as we realigned our portfolio with the changing interest rate environment 
the product of this turnover in was a significant amount of net realized gains 
as part of this realignment in  we sold a significant portion of our closed end preferred stock mutual funds 
the decline in interest rates during much of caused a significant increase in the net asset value of our closed end preferred stock mutual funds and  as a direct consequence  an increase in the net realized investment gains that we recognized for those investments in unrealized investment losses gross unrealized losses on our equity and fixed maturity securities at december   by duration of unrealized loss  follow over total months months months months total equity and fixed maturity securities number of positions total fair value total amortized cost unrealized loss unrealized loss percentage to fair value equity securities number of positions total fair value total cost unrealized loss unrealized loss percentage to fair value fixed maturity securities number of positions total fair value total amortized cost unrealized loss unrealized loss percentage to fair value we reviewed our investment holdings at december  for other than temporary declines in market value  in accordance with our previously stated accounting policy 
based on this analysis  we determined that the impairments represented in the above gross unrealized loss table are temporary 
the primary reasons for these temporary impairments are related to interest rates and general market conditions 
we intend to hold to recovery or maturity all of our temporarily impaired equity or fixed maturity securities  respectively 
losses and loss adjustment expenses a reconciliation of beginning and ending reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for the years ended and  net of reinsurance deductions from all reinsurers including car  follows incurred losses and lae provision for insured events of the current year decrease in provision for insured events of prior years total incurred losses and lae payments losses and lae attributable to insured events of the current year losses and lae attributable to insured events of prior years total payments increase in loss and lae reserves during the year loss and lae reserves prior to the effect of ceded reinsurance recoverable  beginning of year loss and lae reserves prior to the effect of ceded reinsurance recoverable  end of year ceded reinsurance recoverable loss and lae reserves  end of year as a result of changes in estimates of insured events in prior years  the provision for loss and lae decreased  for the year ended and  for the year ended the favorable development is due primarily to lower than anticipated losses related to the personal automobile liability  the automobile physical damage and the commercial multiple peril lines of business 
conditions and trends that have affected development in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based upon these developments 
the amounts we will ultimately incur from loss and loss adjustment expenses could differ materially in the near term from the amounts recorded 
approximately  in personal automobile liability redundancies developed for the year ended  with of this amount coming from the  and accident years 
the primary reason for the redundancies in this area is that claim severity came in better than we anticipated 
automobile physical damage had approximately  in redundancies related to the accident year 
in  we also experienced redundancies of  for the commercial multiple peril line of business  half of which related to the accident year 
various redundancies and deficiencies for the other lines of business and accident years combined for the remaining approximately  net redundancy

increases in stock option and bva expenses in the periods have similarly affected policy acquisition costs 
interest expense and amortization of bond fees interest expense and amortization of bond fees are from our senior notes which we issued in december income taxes our overall effective tax rate for the year ended was as compared to for in both years  our effective rate was lower than the statutory rate of primarily due to tax exempt interest and the corporate dividends received deduction 
our effective tax rate increased in due to improved underwriting results which are taxed at 
our income tax rate for was benefited by the reversal of a million tax valuation allowance related to investments which we established in new accounting pronouncement the financial accounting standards board issued in december revised rules for accounting for stock options and other equity based remuneration  share based payment 
we will adopt these revised rules in the third quarter of when they become effective 
this change will not impact our results of operations and financial condition for the stock options we awarded through under the plan  because application of the revised rules is on a prospective basis 
we have not granted any stock options to our employees under our incentive compensation plan since the revised rules will not change our accounting for bvas and the stock options we award under the american commerce plan 
year ended compared to year ended overview our net earnings for the year ended  as compared to  were favorably affected primarily by significant increases in our realized investment gains 
our after tax net realized investment gains for the year ended increased by million compared to the increase was due to after tax net investment gains for of million compared to after tax net investment losses of million for the after tax net investment gains resulted primarily from our decision to sell a significant portion of our securities with unrealized gains in order to implement a change in our investment view  and  the favorable impact on the net asset value of closed end preferred stock mutual funds due to market conditions as well as significant sales of these funds during the year 
the after tax net investment losses were primarily caused by the decrease in net asset value  or nav  of our equity investment in closed end preferred stock mutual funds  the write down of securities for other than temporary impairment of value  and the impact of the valuation allowance on deferred taxes 
see investment gains and losses 
partially offsetting the change in after tax net investment gains losses was the effect of two one time items which increased income 
in  we had million of other income and million for the after tax cumulative effect of a change in accounting for negative goodwill 
the million of prior year other income was related to payments received from other insurance carriers under agreements to assume their massachusetts personal automobile insurance business written in massachusetts 
our losses and loss adjustment expenses increased by million  or  for the year ended compared to the increase resulted primarily from our premium growth partially offset by a decrease in our loss ratio on a statutory basis to from in the decrease was primarily driven by slightly more favorable experience in the current year personal automobile line of business due to increases in average earned premium revenue per automobile and more favorable loss reserve development compared to our policy acquisition costs increased by million  or for the year ended compared to the increase resulted primarily from our premium growth  partially offset by a decrease in our underwriting ratio on a statutory basis to for the year ended compared to for the decrease in our underwriting ratio was primarily due to lower policy year mandated massachusetts personal automobile commission rates 
see policy acquisition costs 
included in losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs are certain corporate expenses related to stock options granted to agents of american commerce and book value awards granted to our officers 
during  corporate expenses related to the american commerce agents options increased to million  as compared to million in this increase was due to an increase in the market value of our common stock  an increase in the number of stock options outstanding  an additional year of vesting of those stock options granted in prior years and changes in estimates made to certain assumptions used in our fair value estimation 
the corporate expenses related to the book value awards amounted to million in  as compared to million in the value of book value awards is primarily related to the growth in our stockholders equity 
at december   our stockholders equity per share was  as compared to 
at december  premiums the following table and discussion compares direct premiums written  net premiums written and earned premiums for the years ended and change change massachusetts direct premiums written personal automobile commercial automobile homeowners other lines massachusetts direct premiums written other than massachusetts direct premiums written personal automobile commercial automobile homeowners other lines other than massachusetts direct premiums written total direct premiums written massachusetts direct earned premiums personal automobile commercial automobile homeowners other lines massachusetts direct earned premiums other than massachusetts direct earned premiums personal automobile commercial automobile homeowners other lines other than massachusetts direct earned premiums total direct earned premiums the increase in massachusetts personal automobile direct premiums written during resulted primarily from a increase in average written premium per written exposure coupled with a increase in the number of exposures written 
we attribute the growth in exposures to increased penetration of our independent agents books of business as the overall number of exposures in massachusetts has had less than growth during the period 
the increase in other than massachusetts personal automobile and homeowners business was primarily due to additional rate per policy coupled with an approximate increase in business written  offset slightly by a decreased retention in personal automobile in force policies 
our increase in massachusetts commercial automobile premiums is directly related to our effort to increase writings in this line of business and from increases in the average rate per policy 
our increase in massachusetts homeowner premiums is primarily related to an increase in average premium per policy  increases in policy count due to an increased number of agents  fewer carriers writing homeowner business  our pricing position in the marketplace  and  agents writing more homeowner business to achieve a homeowner discount for their customer when we also insure the customer s automobile 
the increase in total earned premiums for was primarily attributable to increases in personal and commercial automobile business 
net investment income net investment income is affected by the composition of our investment portfolio and yields on those investments 
as depicted in the following table  net investment income for the year ended decreased million  or  compared to  principally as a result of a decrease in average yields partially offset by an increase in average invested assets at cost 
the decrease in yield is primarily due to lower short term yields coupled with an environment of lower average long term yields and higher yielding investment securities being called 
the decline in average long term yields is illustrated by a decrease in the yield on year government bonds which declined basis points from an average of at december  to an average of at december  years ended investment return average month end investments at cost net investment income before tax net investment income after tax net investment income as a percentage of average net investments at cost net investment income after tax as a percentage of average net investments at cost premium finance and service fees premium finance and service fees increased million  or  during the year ended  as a result of increased business and a service fee increase on massachusetts new and renewal business from to per installment payment  for policies with effective dates on or after july investment gains and losses net realized investment gains totaled million  or per diluted share  for the year ended as compared to net realized investment losses of million  or per diluted share  for during  we sold a significant portion of our securities with unrealized gains in order to implement a change in our investment view 
our investment strategy emphasizes investment yield while maintaining investment quality 
the focus of our investment objectives continues to be maximizing after tax investment income through investing in high quality diversified investments structured to maximize after tax investment income while minimizing risk 
a secondary objective is to achieve above average after tax total return 
our funds are generally invested in securities with maturities intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims and meet other operating needs without the forced sale of investments 
this change in view caused us to reduce the average duration of our investment portfolio during the second and third quarters  which in turn resulted in the sale of a number of securities that had increased in value significantly as overall credit spreads tigh tened 
this caused overall portfolio turnover eg volume of trades to increase beyond that of recent years 
the portfolio sales occurred in securities that had been purchased during as well as those purchased in previous years 
thus  while we did sell some higher yielding instruments  the overall after tax yield of the portfolio did not fall significantly beyond the decline in interest rates as a whole 
during the third quarter as interest rates rose  we began to invest in longer term securities  resulting in a slightly higher duration at year end 
primarily as a result of these sales  we realized net investment gains of million in those categories for the year ended  compared to a net realized investment loss of million on sales of securities in those categories during of the remaining million total of net realized gains  we recognized net gains of million for the year ended attributable to the change in the net asset value of seven closed end preferred stock mutual funds in which we owned or more through the period our ownership remained greater than 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we dropped below the ownership level and did not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies for six funds 
therefore  as of december   the investments were reported at fair market value and the unrealized gains or losses from the point our ownership fell below to year end were reported as comprehensive income 
see critical accounting policies investments 
for the year ended  the net realized investment gains attributable to these fund investments were million  as compared to net realized investment losses of million for th at category of investments for market conditions during caused a significant increase in the net asset value of those funds and  as a direct consequence  an increase in the net realized investment gains that we recognized for those investments for the year ended our gains on investment securities were partially offset by write downs for other than temporary declines in the market value of certain fixed maturities  preferred stocks and common stocks totaling million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
the other than temporary write downs for the period consisted of million for one municipal bond  million for three corporate bonds  million for three preferred stocks and million for five common stocks 
the other than temporary write downs for consisted of million for one municipal bond  million for three corporate bonds  million for eight preferred stocks and million for two common stocks 
we use the aging table below in our analysis of our exposure to potential other than temporary impairment

conditions and trends that have affected development in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based upon these developments 
the amounts we will ultimately incur from loss and loss adjustment expenses could differ materially in the near term from the amounts recorded 
approximately  in personal automobile liability redundancies developed for the year ended  with two thirds of this amount coming from the and accident years 
the remaining redundancy in this area came about evenly from the four accident years prior to this 
the primary reason for the redundancies in this area is that claim severity came in better than we anticipated 
the approximate  worse development in automobile physical damage occurred in the accident year offset by redundancies in the accident year 
the impact was mainly from higher ibnr claims as a result of a severe winter storm during the last week of  coupled with higher severity on physical damage claims 
the redundancies primarily resulted from higher than anticipated subrogation 
we also experienced deficiencies of  and  for accident years and  respectively  in in our commercial automobile liability area 
these defic iencies were primarily related to higher severity as compared to claims incurred in prior years 
various redundancies and deficiencies for the other lines of business and accident years combined for the remaining approximately  net deficiency 
the redundancies for year end primarily related to the personal automobile liability area  as claim severity mainly came in better than anticipated and was offset by worse development for the previous accident years

combined ratio for the year ended  our combined ratio was  compared with for the decrease in the combined ratio was primarily the result of the factors that resulted in the lower loss and underwriting ratios previously mentioned 
income taxes our overall effective tax rate for the year ended was as compared to for in both years  our effective rate was lower than the statutory rate of primarily due to tax exempt interest and the corporate dividends received deduction 
our income tax rate for the year ended was adversely impacted by a tax valuation allowance of million related to a deferred tax asset previously established for realized investment losses 
our income tax rate for was benefited by the reversal of the tax valuation allowance from change in accounting principle due to the effect of a change in accounting principle related to goodwill  we recorded income in the first quarter of  net of taxes  of million  or per share diluted 
this amount represented the remaining unamortized negative goodwill related to closed end preferred stock mutual funds and the remaining excess of book value of subsidiary interest over cost relating to the acquisition of american commerce 
negative goodwill and the excess of book value of subsidiary interest over cost were created in these acquisitions because the underlying value of the assets purchased exceeded the purchase price 
the subsequent recognition of income that occurred as these items were eliminated was not a taxable event but instead became part of the basis of the acquired asset 
financial condition our financial condition improved significantly in our stockholders equity per share increased from at december  to at december  our ratio of total liabilities to stockholders equity decreased nearly percentage points at december  from the prior year end  despite total liability growth of 
this decrease is primarily due to current year earnings and growth in paid in capital from stock option exercises  partially offset by changes in treasury shares and net accumulated other comprehensive income 
the market and equity value of our total investments increased due to our investing cash from operating and investing activities  partially offset by unrealized losses

payment amounts are estimated  based on payment patterns experienced through we have commitments in two venture capital fund investments 
these investments are made in limited partnerships and our exposure to loss is limited to our actual investment 
one limited partnership investment required a commitment by us to invest up to  into the partnership 
as of december   we have invested  into the partnership 
the partnership was formed to operate as an investment fund principally for the purpose of making investments primarily in equity  equity related and other securities issued in expansion financing  start ups  buy outs and recapitalization transactions relating to companies in the areas of insurance  financial services  e commerce  healthcare  and related businesses  including  without limitation  service and technology enterprises supporting such businesses 
the other limited partnership interest required a commitment by us to invest up to  into the partnership

there are several limitations in the contract regarding losses related to nuclear  chemical  and biological terrorist events 
our maximum loss recovery in case of these types of events is estimated at million 
our estimated total loss  before reinsurance  on our other than automobile business for and year hurricanes is approximately million and million  respectively 
we derived our estimates through the services of employers reinsurance corporation on our december  other than automobile exposures  which utilized the rms risk management solutions risk assessment system 
we believe that most property and casualty insurance companies establ ish their catastrophe reinsurance programs between the year and year storm estimates 
note m to our consolidated financial statements provides additional information about our reinsurance 
industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to statutory policyholders surplus should not exceed to 
the following table presents  on a consolidated basis  our net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio for the year ended net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from insurance premiums  net investment income  premium finance and service fees and the maturing and sale of investments 
the primary uses of our liquidity are payment of policy claims  operating costs  interest on our senior notes  and payment of dividends to our stockholders 
in november  our board of directors approved commerce insurance s application to become a member of the federal home loan bank of boston 
if the application is accepted by the fhlb of boston  commerce insurance will have a significant new source of liquidity 
the fhlb of boston  which is one of regional fhlbs  serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region 
the fhlb of boston makes loans  which are referred to as advances  to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by its board of directors 
these policies and procedures are subject to the regulation and oversight of the federal housing finance board 
all advances from the fhlb of boston to commerce insurance would be required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the fhlb 
if commerce insurance had been a member of the fhlb of boston as of december   we estimate that commerce insurance would have had the capacity to borrow approximately  from the fhlb of boston 
we expect to pay significantly more for agent profit sharing in than we paid in we paid approximately  for agent profit sharing in due to our excellent underwriting results during the current year  we estimate paying  in the second quarter of market risk interest rate sensitivity and equity price risk our investment strategy emphasizes after tax investment yield while maintaining overall investment quality 
the primary focus of our investment objectives continues to be maximizing after tax investment income through investing primarily in high quality diversified fixed income investments structured to maximize after tax investment income while minimizing risk 
we generally invest in securities with maturities intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims and meet other operating needs without the forced sale of investments 
when the appropriate opportunity arises  we will recognize investment gains to increase after tax total return 
we held no derivatives  emerging market securities or hedge funds at december  and in conducting investing activities  we are subject to  and assume  market risk 
market risk is the risk of an adverse financial impact from changes in interest rates and market prices 
the level of risk assumed by us is a function of our overall objectives  liquidity needs and market volatility 
we manage our market risk by focusing on higher quality equity and fixed income investments  by periodically monitoring the credit strength of companies in which investments are made  by limiting exposure in any one investment and by monitoring the quality of the investment portfolio by taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized rating organizations 
our portfolio included six securities in default  three corporate bonds and three preferred stocks with a total carrying value of at december  of our bonds and preferred stocks  of the market value was rated in either of the two highest quality categories provided by the naic as of december   as compared to at december  although we have significant holdings of various closed end preferred stock mutual funds  these funds are comprised primarily of preferred and common stocks traded on national stock exchanges  thus limiting exposure to any one obligor 
interest rate sensitivity 
as part of our investing activities  we assume positions in fixed maturity  equity  short term and cash equivalents markets 
therefore  we are exposed to the impacts of interest rate changes in the market value of investments 
at december   our exposure to interest rate changes and equity price risk has been estimated using sensitivity analysis 
the interest rate impact is defined as the effect of a hypothetical interest rate change of plus or minus basis points on the market value of fixed maturities and preferred stocks 
changes in interest rates would result in unrealized gains or losses in the market value of the fixed maturity and preferred stock portfolio due to differences between current market rates and the stated rates for these investments 
the following table summarizes our interest rate risk  based on the results of the sensitivity analysis at december  the table also reflects the changes in market value and stockholders equity that would be attributable to realized investment gains losses that we would recognize under the equity method of accounting with respect to the change in the net asset value of the mutual fund in which we own or more of the shares outstanding 
see critical accounting policies investments and other than temporary impairments 
hypothetical change in interest rates estimated market value of fixed income and preferred stock investments estimated increase decrease in market value hypothetical percentage increase decrease in stockholders equity basis point increase no change basis point decrease net of income taxes at an assumed rate of 
our fixed income portfolio s weighted average duration which includes all fixed maturities and preferred stocks as of december  and was years 
the duration of a security is the time weighted present value of the security s expected cash flows and is used to measure a security s price sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
the duration reflects industry prepayment assumptions 
the analytic systems we used to calculate the above duration data utilize optional call dates  sinking fund requirements and assume a non static prepayment pattern in deriving these averages 
as of the end of february  our weighted average duration has declined to years primarily as a result of sales of securities during the first two months of equity price risk 
the equity price risk is defined as a hypothetical change of plus or minus in the market value of common stocks 
the following table summarizes our equity price risk  based on the results of the sensitivity analysis at december  hypothetical change in market price estimated market value of common equity investments estimated increase decrease in market value hypothetical percentage increase decrease in stockholders equity price increase price increase no change price decrease price decrease includes both common stocks and a closed end preferred stock mutual fund valued at equity

the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions such as the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  reinvestment and replacement of asset and liability cash flows and other assumptions 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic conditions  we cannot provide any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that management might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
effects of inflation and recession we generally are unable to recover the costs of inflation in our personal automobile insurance line since the premiums charged for personal automobile insurance in massachusetts  our principal business segment  are subject to state regulation 
additionally  the premium rates that we charge for personal automobile insurance in massachusetts are adjusted by the commissioner only at annual intervals 
such annual adjustments in premium rates may lag behind related cost increases 
economic recessions can have an impact upon us  primarily through the policyholder s election to decrease non compulsory coverages afforded by the policy and decreased driving  each of which tends to decrease claims 
to the extent inflation and economic recession influence yields on investments  we are also affected 
as each of these environments affect current market rates of return  previously committed investments may rise or decline in value depending on the type and maturity of investment 
inflation and recession must also be considered by us in the creation and review of loss and lae reserves since portions of these reserves are expected to be paid over extended periods of time 
the anticipated effect of economic conditions is implicitly considered when estimating liabilities for losses and lae 
the importance of continually adjusting reserves is even more pronounced in periods of changing economic circumstances
