item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a review of revenue  net income loss  and total assets for the last three years 

table of contents our strategy rising healthcare costs and health insurance premiums are causing employers  as well as federal and state government programs  to shift more of the cost of healthcare benefits to employees in the form of higher premium contributions  deductibles  co insurance and co payments 
since  average premiums for family coverage in the united states increased  while wages grew only 
typical family out of pocket healthcare costs now exceed of the average annual wage 
as a result of increased personal spending on healthcare  healthcare consumers ie  employees and their family members  individuals  and retirees are demanding better service  efficiency  and value from their health plan 
this includes improved information regarding health care benefit and insurance coverage options  better information to determine the most efficient methods to fund out of pocket costs  real time information regarding benefits eligibility and accessibility  accurate information at the point of service regarding out of pocket costs ie  patient or consumer financial responsibility  real time information regarding healthcare fund balances and claims payment status  and increased comparative data and intelligence regarding healthcare provider cost ie  pricing and quality 
we believe that payers will play a central and critical role in the evolution of the us healthcare industry 
we also believe that most health plans and benefits administrators must evolve and improve their technology infrastructure  software applications  and business processes to compete in this changing healthcare marketplace 
we recognize that the evolution of the healthcare industry to a more retail like environment will be gradual 
our strategy  therefore  is to protect our existing customers investment in our products and services through ongoing research and development that allows for systematic upgrades of existing capabilities  while providing both existing and new payer customers with innovative it expertise  technology based products and services that help them strengthen their it capabilities  and transform their businesses to prosper in this more consumer centric environment 
key elements of our strategy include help customers anticipate change and migrate toward a successful future

outsourced business services in  we derived approximately of our total revenue from outsourced business services 
our outsourced business services fall into two categories  described in more detail below software hosting and application management and business process management 
software hosting and application management 
software hosting services include integrating  hosting  monitoring  and managing our proprietary software applications alongside other software applications from third party vendors 
we deliver software on a cost predictable subscription basis  through multi year contracts that include service levels 
our hosted solutions significantly reduce customers capital investments in information technology  the operating costs associated with owning software and hardware  and the cost of operating  maintaining  and managing their software applications and physical information infrastructure 
other advantages of hosting include rapid deployment  reliability  scalability  lower implementation risk  and preservation of legacy systems 
through our data center in colorado  we host  operate  and maintain integrated software solutions for our customers on most of the widely used computing  networking  and operating platforms 
we provide access to our hosted applications across high speed electronic communications channels  such as frame relay  virtual private networks  or the internet 
the center operates with state of the art environmental protection systems to maintain high availability to host systems and provide wide area network access 
connection to our hosted application servers and services is provided using the industry standard tcp ip protocol 
we believe this provides the most efficient and cost effective transport for information systems services  as well as simplified support and management 
our network connectivity infrastructure eliminates our customers need to manage and support their own computer systems  network  and software 
our hosted solutions provide complete  professionally managed information technology systems that include desktop and network connections  primary software applications that are essential to running the business  specialized ancillary software  and information management access and reporting capabilities to aid in data analysis and decision making 
customers can choose the combination of our products and services to best meet their business requirements 
vendor partner relationships 
in order to provide our customers with accessibility to other specialty software applications that run integrated and alongside trizetto solutions  we have acquired rights to license and or deploy numerous commercially available software applications from a variety of healthcare and other software vendors 
these relationships range from perpetual  reusable software licenses and contracts to preferred installer agreements to informal co marketing arrangements 
we enter into relationships with software vendors in order to offer our customers a variety of solutions tailored to their unique information technology needs 
our relationships with our vendor partners are designed to provide both parties with numerous mutual benefits 
business process management bpm 
to complement our software hosting services  we also provide health plans and benefits administrators with transaction processing services for typical back office functions  including claims  billing  and enrollment 
customers typically outsource to us for the following reasons to improve or maintain service  for more predictable costs  to take advantage of our larger scale  to reduce risk through our performance guarantees  to gain access to our technical and healthcare business expertise  to increase speed to market  to ensure business continuity  and to become hipaa compliant

business continuity services 
we have facilities and personnel available to assist customers using our proprietary products to meet business processing requirements in the event of a loss of a customer site 
these business processing services are generally provided in our centralized processing locations 
approximately employees are located at our various processing sites  providing services for customers using our facets  qiclink  and other proprietary and third party software systems 
professional services we derived approximately of our revenue from professional services in  mainly from consulting and implementations associated with our proprietary software  software hosting  and other outsourcing contracts 
as of december   we employed approximately professional services personnel 
our professional services personnel team help our customers reduce administrative and medical costs  improve the quality of medical care delivered  and improve member satisfaction by helping our clients assess their information technology capabilities relative to their business plans and processes  and then assist them in developing effective information technology strategies and plans  to achieve competitive advantage by employing our leading information technology products and services  providing expertise in all aspects of trizetto s proprietary software products  especially facets  qiclink  healthweb  hipaa gateway  and networx  through onsite services  remote support  and customer training  re engineering our customer s key business processes to achieve higher business performance  assisting our customers to design and implement effective electronic commerce strategies  including internet portals  web sites  intranets and extranets  that facilitate business to business and business to consumer transactions  assisting our customers with the design  development  and implementation of business intelligence and data management strategies  software  and business processes to improve information access and management decision making  working with our customers to install and implement our industry leading applications and technology products through all of the stages of systems analysis and planning  evaluation  design  configuration and customization  custom software development  data conversion  testing  training and systems support  and providing unique information technology expertise to help our customers optimize their technology infrastructure and network investments  tune for optimum performance  and maximize effective data center operations 
sales and marketing our primary sales and marketing approach is to utilize our direct sales force to promote trizetto as the single source for comprehensive healthcare information technology products and services to payers 
as of december   we had approximately sales  sales support  account management and marketing employees throughout the united states 
our professional sales force  comprised of experienced sales executives  sells our entire range of offerings to current and prospective customers  including 
table of contents enterprise software  specialized component software  outsourced business services  and consulting services 
we also have specialized sales personnel who focus exclusively on our care management and network management offerings 
separate sales teams have been established for the health plan and benefits administration markets 
our solutions architecture team supports the sale of enterprise software  component software  hosting  business process management and professional services 
sales support personnel provide in depth technical information  provide product demonstrations  and negotiate contracts with our customers and prospects 
to support the overall sales process  multi disciplinary pursuit teams are established for each major prospect  spearheaded by a member of executive management 
our marketing organization is organized by target market and is closely aligned with the sales force to provide market specific campaigns and lead generation initiatives for our enterprise software  component software  outsourced business services  and consulting services 
these initiatives include direct mail campaigns  marketing collateral  trade shows  seminars  and events 
the marketing organization also develops and supports our overall corporate positioning and branding  coordinates market research  and handles all tradeshows  customer conferences and events 
the product marketing team works closely with our business unit leadership to help bring our products and services to commercial ready status  as well as to adapt messaging to support key target market segments such as consumer directed and government sponsored 
our professional services group works closely with the sales organization to provide a consultative  executive selling approach that complements our sales program 
this team of healthcare information technology professionals is trained in a proprietary assessment methodology that allows a quick and comprehensive analysis of a customer s information technology capabilities and requirements 
in conjunction with their consulting responsibilities  our professional services group identifies opportunities to introduce customers to the broad range of applications and technology solutions available to them  including those that we offer 
customer service we believe that personalized support is necessary to maintain long term relationships with our customers 
an account manager is assigned to each of our larger services customers and many of our installed software customers 
they are responsible for proactively monitoring customer satisfaction  providing customers with additional training and process improvement opportunities  and coordinating issue resolution 
we employ functional and technical support personnel who work directly with our account management team and customers to resolve technical  operational and application problems or questions 
our service desk provides a wide range of customer support functions 
our customers may contact the service desk through a toll free number hours a day  seven days a week 
for non urgent issues  customers can also enter incidents directly into the customer support system via the internet 
because we support multiple applications and technology solutions  our functional and technical support staff are grouped and trained by specific application and by application type 
these focused staff groups have concentrated expertise that we can deploy as needed to address customer needs 
we cross train employees to support multiple applications and technology solutions and create economies of scale in our support staff 
we further leverage the capabilities of our support staff through the use of sophisticated software that tracks solutions to common computer and software related problems 
this allows our support staff to learn from the experience of other people within the organization and reduces the time it takes to solve problems 
in addition  we provide customer support for our business process outsourcing services 
competition the market for healthcare information technology services is intensely competitive  rapidly evolving  highly fragmented and subject to rapid technological change 
by using proprietary technologies and methods  we develop  integrate and deliver packaged enterprise and component software applications  connectivity solutions for both internet and direct communication  application hosting  infrastructure outsourced business services and it consulting services 
our competitors provide some or all of the services that we provide 
our competitors can be categorized as follows information technology and outsourcing companies  such as perot systems corporation  ibm  affiliated computer services  computer sciences corporation  and electronic data systems corporation  healthcare software application vendors  such as quality care solutions  inc and amisys synertech inc  healthcare information technology consulting firms  such as first consulting group  inc  superior consultant holdings corporation and the consulting divisions or former affiliates of the major accounting firms  such as deloitte consulting and accenture  
table of contents healthcare e commerce and portal companies  such as webmd corporation  navimedix and healthtrio  and enterprise application integration vendors such as vitria  seebeyond  tibco  fuego and m each of these types of companies can be expected to compete with us within various segments of the healthcare information technology market 
furthermore  major software information systems companies and other entities  including those specializing in the healthcare industry that are not presently offering applications that compete with our products and services  may enter our markets 
in addition  some of our third party software vendors compete with us from time to time by offering their software on a licensed or hosted basis 
we believe companies in our industry primarily compete based on performance  price  software functionality  ease of implementation  level of service  and track record of successful customer installations 
although our competitive position is difficult to characterize due principally to the variety of current and potential competitors and the evolving nature of our market  we believe that we presently compete favorably with respect to all of these factors 
while our competition comes from many industry segments  we believe no other single company offers the integrated  single source solution that we provide to our customers 
to be competitive  we must continue to enhance our products and services  as well as our sales  marketing  and distribution channels to respond promptly and effectively to changes in the healthcare industry  including consolidation  constantly evolving standards and government regulation affecting healthcare transactions  the challenges of technological innovation and adoption  evolving business practices of our customers  our competitors new products and services  new products and services developed by our vendor partners and suppliers  and challenges in hiring and retaining information technology professionals 
backlog our total backlog is defined as the revenue we expect to generate in future periods from existing customer contracts 
our month backlog is defined as the revenue we expect to generate from existing customer contracts over the next months 
most of the revenue in our backlog is derived from multi year recurring revenue contracts including software hosting  business process outsourcing  it outsourcing  and software maintenance 
for purposes of calculating our backlog and based upon our previous experience  we assume software maintenance contracts will be renewed for a period of up to five years 
we classify revenue from software license and consulting contracts as non recurring 
consulting revenue is included in the backlog when the revenue from such consulting contract will be recognized over a period exceeding months 
our total backlog at december   was approximately million 
the month backlog at december   was approximately million 
for a breakout of total and month backlog by recurring and non recurring revenue  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
backlog can change due to a number of factors  including unforeseen changes in implementation schedules  contract cancellations subject to penalties paid by the customer  or customer financial difficulties 
unless we enter into new customer agreements that generate enough revenue to replace or exceed the revenue that is recognized in any given quarter  our backlog will decline 
our backlog at any date may not indicate demand for our products and services  and may not reflect actual revenue for any period in the future 
intellectual property our intellectual property is important to our business 
we rely on certain developed software assets and internal methodologies for performing customer services 
our consulting services group develops and utilizes information technology life cycle methodology and related paper based and software based toolsets to perform customer assessments  planning  design  development  implementation  and support services 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 

table of contents our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products or services 
unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products  services or proprietary information 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights as well as the laws of the united states 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be time consuming and costly 
we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as we expand our product and service offerings and the number of competitors increases 
defending against these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive and divert our attention from operating our company 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing upon their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and be forced to develop non infringing technology  obtain a license or cease using the applications that contain the infringing technology or content 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or content or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we also rely on a variety of technologies that are licensed from third parties to perform key functions 
these third party licenses are an essential element of our hosted solutions business 
these third party licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms in the future 
the loss of or inability to maintain any of these licenses could delay the introduction of software enhancements and other features until equivalent technology can be licensed or developed 
any such delay could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers 
significant customers as of december   we served unique customers 
no single customer or group of affiliated customers generated or more of our consolidated revenues in employees as of december   we had approximately  employees 
our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements  and we generally have good relations with our employees 
available information our website is located at www 
trizetto 
com 
we make available free of charge through this website all of our sec filings including our annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k  and all amendments to those reports  as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports are electronically filed with the sec 
risk factors we have a history of operating losses and cannot predict if we will be able to sustain our positive net income 
we have generated net losses in of our past quarters through december  
we may not be able to sustain our current level of revenue or increase our revenue in the future 
we currently derive our revenue primarily from providing hosted solutions  software licensing and maintenance  and other services such as consulting 
we depend on the continued demand for healthcare information technology and related services 
we plan to continue investing in administrative infrastructure  research and development  sales and marketing  and acquisitions 
if we are not able to sustain our current levels of revenue or maintain our profitability  our operations may be adversely affected 
revenue from a limited number of customers comprises a significant portion of our total revenue  and if these customers terminate or modify existing contracts or experience business difficulties  it could adversely affect our earnings 
as of december   we were providing services to unique customers 
four of our customers represented an aggregate of approximately of our total revenue in no single customer or group of affiliated customers  however  generated or more of our consolidated revenues in although we typically enter into multi year customer agreements  a majority of our customers are able to reduce or cancel their use of our services before the end of the contract term  subject to monetary penalties 
we also provide services to some hosted customers without long term contracts 
in addition  many of our contracts are structured so that we generate revenue based on units of volume  which include the number of members  number of physicians or number of users 
if our customers experience business difficulties and the units of volume decline or if a customer ceases operations for any reason  we will generate less revenue under these contracts and our operating results may be materially and adversely impacted 

table of contents our operating expenses are relatively fixed and cannot be reduced on short notice to compensate for unanticipated contract cancellations or reductions 
as a result  any termination  significant reduction or modification of our business relationships with any of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
our business is changing rapidly  which could cause our quarterly operating results to vary and our stock price to fluctuate 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past  and we expect that they will continue to vary in future periods 
our quarterly operating results can vary significantly based on a number of factors  such as our mix of non recurring and recurring revenue  our ability to add new customers and renew existing accounts  selling additional products and services to existing customers  meeting project milestones and customer expectations  seasonality in information technology purchases  the timing of new customer sales  and general economic conditions 
historically  we have experienced higher revenues in the fourth quarter and lower revenues in the first quarter  which we believe is primarily a result of our customers willingness to incur information technology expenditures later in the fiscal year 
the variation in our quarterly operating results could cause us to not meet the earnings estimates of securities analysts or investors which could affect the market price of our common stock in a manner that may be unrelated to our long term operating performance 
in addition  we expect to increase activities and spending in substantially all of our operational areas 
we base our expense levels in part upon our expectations concerning future revenue  and these expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term 
if we do not achieve our expected revenue targets  we may not be able to reduce our short term spending in response 
any shortfall in revenue would have a direct impact on our results of operations 
the intensifying competition we face from both established entities and new entries in the market may adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
the market for our technology and services is highly competitive and rapidly changing and requires potentially expensive technological advances 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources  and greater market recognition than we have 
many of our competitors also have  or may develop or acquire  substantial installed customer bases in the healthcare industry 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their applications or services than we can devote 
our competitors can be categorized as follows information technology and outsourcing companies  such as perot systems corporation  ibm  affiliated computer services  computer sciences corporation  and electronic data systems corporation  healthcare information software vendors  such as quality care solutions  inc  and amisys synertech inc 
healthcare information technology consulting firms  such as first consulting group  inc  superior consultant holdings corporation and the consulting divisions or former affiliates of the major accounting firms  such as deloitte consulting and accenture  healthcare e commerce and portal companies  such as webmd corporation  navimedix and healthtrio  and enterprise application integration vendors such as vitria  seebeyond  tibco  fuego and m in addition  some of our third party software vendors may compete with us from time to time by offering their software on a licensed or hosted basis 
further  other entities that do not presently compete with us may do so in the future  including major software information systems companies  financial services entities  or health plans 

table of contents we believe our ability to compete will depend in part upon our ability to maintain and continue to develop partnerships with vendors  enhance our current technology and services  respond effectively to technological changes  introduce new technologies  and meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  pricing  gross margin  and market share could be negatively impacted further as a greater number of available products in the marketplace increases the likelihood that product and service offerings in our markets become more fungible and price sensitive 
our sales cycles are long and unpredictable 
we have experienced long and unpredictable sales cycles  particularly for contracts with large customers  or customers purchasing multiple products and services 
enterprise software typically requires significant capital expenditures by customers  and the decision to outsource it related services is complicated and time consuming 
major purchases by large payer organizations typically range from to months or more from initial contact to contract execution 
the prospects currently in our pipeline may not sign contracts within a reasonable period of time or at all 
in addition  our implementation cycle has ranged from to months or longer from contract execution to completion of implementation 
during the sales cycle and the implementation cycle  we will expend substantial time  effort  and financial resources preparing contract proposals  negotiating the contract  and implementing the solution 
we may not realize any revenue to offset these expenditures  and  if we do  accounting principles may not allow us to recognize the revenue during corresponding periods  which could harm our future operating results 
additionally  any decision by our customers to delay implementation may adversely affect our revenues 
consolidation of healthcare payer organizations and benefits administrators could decrease the number of our existing and potential customers 
there has been and continues to be acquisition and consolidation activity among healthcare payers and benefits administrators 
mergers or consolidations of payer organizations or payer organizations in the future could decrease the number of our existing and potential customers 
the acquisition of a customer could have a negative impact on our financial condition 
a smaller overall market for our products and services could result in lower revenue 
in addition  healthcare payer organizations are increasing their focus on consumer directed healthcare  in which consumers interact directly with health plans through administrative services provided by health plans to employer groups 
these services compete with the services provided by benefits administrators and could result in additional consolidation in the benefits administration market 
some of our significant customers may develop their own software solutions  which could decrease the demand for our products 
some of our customers in the healthcare payer industry have  or may seek to acquire  the financial and technological resources necessary to develop software solutions to perform the functions currently serviced by our products and services 
additionally  consolidation in the healthcare payer industry could result in additional organizations having the resources necessary to develop similar software solutions 
if these organizations successfully develop and utilize their own software solutions  they may discontinue their use of our products or services  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we depend on our software application vendor relationships  and if our software application vendors terminate or modify existing contracts or experience business difficulties  or if we are unable to establish new relationships with additional software application vendors  it could harm our business 
we depend  and will continue to depend  on our licensing and business relationships with third party software application vendors 
our success depends significantly on our ability to maintain our existing relationships with our vendors and to build new relationships with other vendors in order to enhance our services and application offerings and remain competitive 
although most of our licensing agreements are perpetual or automatically renewable  they are subject to termination in the event that we materially 
table of contents breach such agreements 
we may not be able to maintain relationships with our vendors or establish relationships with new vendors 
the software  products or services of our third party vendors may not achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success 
accordingly  our existing relationships may not result in sustained business partnerships  successful product or service offerings or the generation of significant revenue for us 
our arrangements with third party software application vendors are not exclusive 
these third party vendors may not regard our relationships with them as important to their own respective businesses and operations 
they may reassess their commitment to us at any time and may choose to develop or enhance their own competing distribution channels and product support services 
if we do not maintain our existing relationships or if the economic terms of our business relationships change  we may not be able to license and offer these services and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our inability to obtain any of these licenses could delay service development or timely introduction of new services and divert our resources 
any such delays could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
our licenses for the use of third party software applications are essential to the technology solutions we provide for our customers 
loss of any one of our major vendor agreements may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
we rely on third party software vendors for components of our software products 
our software products contain components developed and maintained by third party software vendors  and we expect that we may have to incorporate software from third party vendors in our future products 
we may not be able to replace the functions provided by the third party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete  defective  or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated 
any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could harm the sale of our products unless and until we can secure or develop an alternative source 
although we believe there are adequate alternate sources for the technology currently licensed to us  such alternate sources may not be available to us in a timely manner  may not provide us with the same functions as currently provided to us or may be more expensive than products we currently use 
we have sustained rapid growth  and our inability to manage this growth could harm our business 
we have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations since inception and expect to continue to do so 
this growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational  and financial resources  and information systems 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows 
our acquisition strategy may disrupt our business and require additional financing 
since inception  we have made several acquisitions 
a significant portion of our historical growth has occurred through acquisitions and we may continue to seek strategic acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 
we compete with other companies to acquire businesses  making it difficult to acquire suitable companies on favorable terms or at all 
we may be unable to successfully integrate companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future in a timely manner 
if we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses  we may incur substantial costs and delays or other operational  technical or financial problems 
in addition  the integration of our acquisitions may divert management s attention from our existing business which could damage our relationships with our key customers and employees 
to finance future acquisitions  we may issue equity securities that could be dilutive to our stockholders 
we may also incur debt and additional amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions 
the interest expense related to this debt and additional amortization expense may significantly reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
our need for additional financing is uncertain as is our ability to raise capital if required 
if we are not able to sustain our positive net income  we may need additional financing to fund operations or growth 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional funds through public or private financings  at any particular point in the future or on favorable terms 
future financings could adversely affect your ownership interest in comparison with those of other stockholders 

table of contents our business will suffer if our software products contain errors 
the proprietary and third party software products we offer are inherently complex 
despite our testing and quality control procedures  errors may be found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products 
significant technical challenges also arise with our products because our customers purchase and deploy those products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third party software applications and databases 
if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of customer support  our costs would increase 
moreover  we could face possible claims and higher development costs if our software contains undetected errors or if we fail to meet our customers expectations 
as a result of the foregoing  we could experience loss of or delay in revenue and loss of market share  loss of customers  damage to our reputation  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by customers against us which could  whether or not successful  increase costs and distract our management  and increased insurance costs 
we could lose customers and revenue if we fail to meet the performance standards and other obligations in our contracts 
many of our service agreements contain performance standards 
if we fail to meet these standards or breach other material obligations under our agreements  our customers could terminate their agreements with us or require that we refund part or all of the fees charged under those agreements 
the termination of any of our material services agreements and or any associated refunds could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
if our ability to expand our network and computing infrastructure is constrained in any way  we could lose customers and damage our operating results 
we must continue to expand and adapt our network and technology infrastructure to accommodate additional users  increased transaction volumes and changing customer requirements 
we may not be able to accurately project the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the use of our hosted solutions or be able to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such increases 
we may be unable to expand or adapt our network infrastructure to meet additional demand or our customers changing needs on a timely basis  at a commercially reasonable cost or at all 
our current information systems  procedures and controls may not continue to support our operations while maintaining acceptable overall performance and may hinder our ability to exploit the market for healthcare applications and services 
service lapses could cause our users to switch to the services of our competitors 
performance or security problems with our systems could damage our business 
our customers satisfaction and our business could be harmed if we  or our customers experience any system delays  failures  or loss of data 
although we devote substantial resources to avoid performance problems  errors may occur 
errors in the processing of customer data may result in loss of data  inaccurate information  and delays 
such errors could cause us to lose customers and be liable for damages 
we currently process substantially all of our customers transactions and data at our data centers in colorado 
although we have safeguards for emergencies and we have contracted backup processing for our customers critical functions  the occurrence of a major catastrophic event or other system failure at any of our facilities could interrupt data processing or result in the loss of stored data 
in addition  we depend on the efficient operation of telecommunication providers that have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages 
a material security breach could damage our reputation or result in liability to us 
we retain confidential customer and patient information in our data centers 
therefore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace to be secure 
despite the implementation of security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  programming errors  attacks by third parties  or similar disruptive problems 

table of contents our services agreements generally contain limitations on liability  and we maintain insurance with coverage limits of million for general liability and million for professional liability to protect against claims associated with the use of our products and services 
however  the contractual provisions and insurance coverage may not provide adequate coverage against all possible claims that may be asserted 
in addition  appropriate insurance may be unavailable in the future at commercially reasonable rates 
a successful claim in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows 
even unsuccessful claims could result in litigation or arbitration costs and may divert management s attention from our existing business 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate management and other key personnel 
our success will depend in large part on the continued services of management and key personnel 
competition for personnel in the healthcare information technology market is intense  and there are a limited number of persons with knowledge of  and experience in  this industry 
we do not have employment agreements with most of our executive officers  so any of these individuals may terminate his or her employment with us at any time 
the loss of services from one or more of our management or key personnel  or the inability to hire additional management or key personnel as needed  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows 
although we currently experience relatively low rates of turnover for our management and key personnel  the rate of turnover may increase in the future 
in addition  we expect to further grow our operations  and our needs for additional management and key personnel will increase 
our continued ability to compete effectively in our business depends on our ability to attract  retain  and motivate these individuals 
we rely on an adequate supply and performance of computer hardware and related equipment from third parties to provide services to larger customers and any significant interruption in the availability or performance of third party hardware and related equipment could adversely affect our ability to deliver our products to certain customers on a timely basis 
as we offer our hosted solution services and software to a greater number of customers and particularly to larger customers  we may require specialized computer equipment that can be difficult to obtain on short notice 
any delay in obtaining such equipment may prevent us from delivering large systems to our customers on a timely basis 
we also rely on such equipment to meet required performance standards 
if such performance standards are not met  we may be adversely impacted under our service agreements with our customers 
any failure or inability to protect our technology and confidential information could adversely affect our business 
our success depends in part upon proprietary software and other confidential information 
the software and information technology industries have experienced widespread unauthorized reproduction of software products and other proprietary technology 
although we have several patent applications pending  we do not own any patents 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
however  these protections may not be sufficient  and they do not prevent independent third party development of competitive products or services 
we believe that our proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties 
however  third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future  and we could be required to enter into a license agreement or royalty arrangement with the party asserting the claim 
we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all 
we may also be required to indemnify customers for claims made against them 
if our consulting services revenue does not grow substantially  our revenue growth could be adversely impacted 
our consulting services revenue represents a significant component of our total revenue and we anticipate that it will continue to represent a significant percentage of total revenue in the future 
the level of consulting services revenue depends upon the healthcare industry s demand for outsourced information technology services and our ability to deliver products that generate implementation and follow on consulting services revenue 
our ability to increase services revenue will depend in part on our ability to increase the capacity of our consulting group  including our ability to recruit  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel 
part of our business will suffer if health plan customers do not accept internet solutions 
the success of facets e business functions  individual healthweb modules and directlink depend in part on the adoption of internet solutions by health plan customers and their constituents enrollees  employers  physicians  and other providers 
adoption requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business and exchanging information 
although we expect internet use to continue to grow in number of users and volume of traffic  the internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it by this continued growth 
our business could suffer substantially if internet solutions are not accepted or not perceived to be effective 
the internet may not prove to be a viable commercial marketplace for a number of reasons  including inadequate development of the necessary infrastructure for communication speed  access  and server reliability  
table of contents security and confidentiality concerns  lack of development of complementary products  such as high speed modems and high speed communication lines  implementation of competing technologies  delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity  and government regulation 
the insolvency of our customers or the inability of our customers to pay for our services could negatively affect our financial condition 
healthcare payers are often required to maintain restricted cash reserves and satisfy strict balance sheet ratios promulgated by state regulatory agencies 
in addition  healthcare payers are subject to risks that physician groups or associations within their organizations become subject to costly litigation or become insolvent  which may adversely affect the financial stability of the payer 
if healthcare payers are unable to pay for our services because of their need to maintain cash reserves or failure to maintain balance sheet ratios or solvency  our ability to collect fees for services rendered would be impaired and our financial condition could be adversely affected 
changes in government regulation of the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business 
during the past several years  the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing levels of government regulation of  among other things  reimbursement rates and certain capital expenditures 
in addition  proposals to substantially reform medicare  medicaid  and the healthcare system in general have been or are being considered by congress 
these proposals  if enacted  may further increase government involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates  and otherwise adversely affect the healthcare industry which could adversely impact our business 
the impact of regulatory developments in the healthcare industry is complex and difficult to predict  and our business could be adversely affected by existing or new healthcare regulatory requirements or interpretations 
participants in the healthcare industry  such as our payer and provider customers  are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations  including laws and regulations relating to the confidential treatment and secure transmission of patient medical records  and other healthcare information 
legislators at both the state and federal levels have proposed and enacted additional legislation relating to the use and disclosure of medical information  and the federal government is likely to enact new federal laws or regulations in the near future 
pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  the department of health and human services dhhs has issued a series of regulations setting forth security  privacy and transactions standards for all health plans  clearinghouses  and healthcare providers to follow with respect to individually identifiable health information 
dhhs has issued final regulations mandating the use of standard transactions and code sets which became effective october  dhhs has also issued final hipaa privacy regulations which became effective on april   and final hipaa security regulations 
many of our customers will also be subject to state laws implementing the federal gramm leach bliley act  relating to certain disclosures of nonpublic personal health information and nonpublic personal financial information by insurers and health plans 
our payer and provider customers must comply with hipaa  its regulations  and other applicable healthcare laws and regulations 
in addition  we may be deemed to be a covered entity subject to hipaa because we offer our customers products that convert data to a hipaa compliant format 
accordingly  we must comply with certain provisions of hipaa and in order for our products and services to be marketable  they must contain features and functions that allow our customers to comply with hipaa and other healthcare laws and regulations 
we believe our products currently allow our customers to comply with existing laws and regulations 
however  because hipaa and its regulations have yet to be fully interpreted  our products may require modification in the future 
if we fail to offer solutions that permit our customers to comply with applicable laws and regulations  our business will suffer 
we perform billing and claims services that are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws 
the federal government in recent years has imposed heightened scrutiny on billing and collection practices of healthcare providers and related entities  particularly with respect to potentially fraudulent billing practices  such as submissions of inflated claims for payment and 
table of contents upcoding 
violations of the laws regarding billing and coding may lead to civil monetary penalties  criminal fines  imprisonment  or exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid and other federally funded healthcare programs for our customers and for us 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows 
federal and state consumer protection laws may apply to us when we bill patients directly for the cost of physician services provided 
failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in a loss of licensure or other fines and penalties 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
in addition  laws governing healthcare payers and providers are often not uniform among states 
this could require us to undertake the expense and difficulty of tailoring our products in order for our customers to be in compliance with applicable state and local laws and regulations 
part of our business is subject to government regulation relating to the internet that could impair our operations 
the internet and its associated technologies are subject to increasing government regulation 
a number of legislative and regulatory proposals are under consideration by federal  state  local  and foreign governments  and agencies 
laws or regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet relating to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet  on line content regulation  user privacy  taxation and quality of products and services 
many existing laws and regulations  when enacted  did not anticipate the methods of the internet based hosted  software and information technology solutions we offer 
we believe  however  that these laws may be applied to us 
we expect our products and services to be in substantial compliance with all material federal  state and local laws and regulations governing our operations 
however  new legal requirements or interpretations applicable to the internet could decrease the growth in the use of the internet  limit the use of the internet for our products and services or prohibit the sale of a particular product or service  increase our cost of doing business  or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial conditions 
to the extent that we market our products and services outside the united states  the international regulatory environment relating to the internet and healthcare services could also have an adverse effect on our business 
item properties facilities as of december   we were leasing a total of facilities located in the united states

on september   mckesson information solutions llc mckesson filed a lawsuit against us in the united states district court for the district of delaware 
in its complaint  mckesson alleged that we have made  used  offered for sale  and or sold a system that infringes mckesson s united states patent no 
 entitled system and method for detecting fraudulent medical claims via examination of services codes 
mckesson seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages of an unspecified amount  including treble damages for willful infringement 
in addition to the matters described above  and from time to time  we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business 
although we are unable at this time to predict the outcome of the mckesson lawsuit  we believe that as of december   we were not a party to any other legal proceedings  the adverse outcome of which  in management s opinion  individually or in the aggregate  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows

as a result of this decision  we estimated that the existing customer agreements from this business would generate a total of million of losses through  until the remaining terms of these agreements expire 
this amount was charged to cost of revenue during the fourth quarter of additionally  in december  we negotiated a settlement regarding out of scope work related to one of our large fixed fee implementation projects 
as a result of this settlement  we estimated that this project would generate a total of million of losses until its completion  which was expected to occur in mid this amount was charged to cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of as a result of our discussions and negotiations with our remaining physician group customers  we have been able to accelerate the termination of our services agreements with certain of these customers 
in addition  we were able to implement cost cutting measures beginning in the second quarter of that have reduced the expected cost to support certain of our remaining physician group customers 
as a result of these actions  we reversed approximately million and million in the first and second quarters of  respectively  of previously accrued loss on contracts charges to cost of revenue 
we will continue to assess this accrual on a quarterly basis to reflect the latest status of customer agreements known to us 
also in  we determined that the large fixed fee implementation project would require a greater effort to complete than previously estimated 
as a result  we accrued an additional million and million loss on contracts charges to cost of revenue in the first and second quarters of  respectively 
no additional loss on contracts charges were accrued in the third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we negotiated a settlement of additional out of scope work  which decreased the total loss on the project and allowed us to reverse approximately  in loss on contracts charges 
this fixed fee implementation was substantially completed by year end anticipated losses on fixed price contracts are accrued in the period in which they become known 
as of january   we adopted the rules set forth in financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which states that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will be subject to annual impairment tests instead of being amortized 
effective january   goodwill  along with acquired workforce reclassified to goodwill in accordance with statement  are no longer being amortized 
in connection with our acquisitions in  we wrote off million during of the total purchase price attributable to acquired in process technology as technological feasibility of the products had not been established 
in december  we initiated a number of restructuring actions focused on eliminating redundancies  streamlining operations and improving overall financial results 
these initiatives included workforce reductions  office closures  discontinuation of certain business lines and related asset write offs 
in the fourth quarter of  approximately  of restructuring expense was reversed related to the lease settlements for the facility closures in naperville  illinois and westmont  illinois  which were previously accrued for in fiscal year as a result of our decision in the fourth quarter of to wind down our outsourcing services to physician groups and to discontinue our outsourcing services to certain non facets payer customers  we estimated that our future net cash flows from the assets used in these businesses will not recover their net book value 
accordingly  a total charge of million was taken as a restructuring and impairment charge in the fourth quarter of  which represented the net book value of these assets 
the assets were written off in the first quarter of after the end of the fourth quarter of  our market capitalization decreased to a level that required us to perform additional analyses under statement to quantify the amount of impairment to goodwill 
this analysis resulted in an impairment charge to goodwill of million as of december  the decrease in market capitalization was also an indicator that our other intangible assets might also be impaired as of december   and they were also tested for impairment in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no

we generate recurring revenue from several sources  including the provision of outsourcing services  such as software hosting and business process management services  and the sale of maintenance and support for our proprietary software products 
we generate non recurring revenue from the licensing of our software and from consulting fees for implementation  installation  configuration  business process engineering  data conversion  testing and training related to the use of our proprietary  and third party licensed products 
cost of revenue includes costs related to the products and services we provide to our customers and costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our customer connectivity centers 
these costs include salaries and related expenses for consulting personnel  customer connectivity centers personnel  customer support personnel  application software license fees  amortization of capitalized software development costs  telecommunications costs  and maintenance costs 
research and development r d expenses are salaries and related expenses associated with the development of software applications prior to establishing technological feasibility 
such expenses include compensation paid to engineering personnel and fees to outside contractors and consultants 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for sales  sales commissions  account management  marketing  administrative  finance  legal  human resources and executive personnel  and fees for certain professional services 
as part of our growth strategy  we intend to increase revenue per customer by continuing to offer complementary products and services to our enterprise software and connectivity solutions 
many of these service offerings  including hosting  business process outsourcing  and consulting have a higher cost of revenue  resulting in lower gross profit margins 
therefore  to the extent that our revenue increases through the sale of these lower margin product and service offerings  our total gross profit margin may decrease 
we are continuing to target larger health plan customers 
this has given us the opportunity to sell additional services such as software hosting  business intelligence  and business process outsourcing services 
it also has improved the stability of our customer base 
as the technology requirements of our customers become more sophisticated  our service offerings have become more complex 
this has lengthened our sales cycles and made it more difficult for us to predict the timing of our software and services sales 
on september   coventry health care  inc coventry acquired altius health plans  inc altius  one of our outsourced services customers 
we have terminated our services agreement with altius effective may  revenue from the altius services agreement was million in  which includes a million termination fee  and million in through the date of termination of the services agreement 
in late  a management decision was made to exit certain non strategic and less profitable activities 
this decision included winding down services related to our physician group customers  as well as the planned elimination of our hosting and business process management services for two competing third party software platforms 
we continue to make progress in accelerating the termination of our services to our physician group customers 
we have reached termination agreements with all of these customers  except for two 
we are negotiating termination agreements with these two customers and expect to finalize these agreements during the first quarter of upon execution  a significant portion of the accrual for loss on contracts is expected to be reversed 
as planned  we have fully exited our hosting and business process management services for the two competing third party software platforms by year end 
table of contents in the second quarter of  we initiated certain cost containment efforts  which included workforce reductions  modifications to certain employee benefit programs and other actions 
we realized a significant portion of these benefits in the third and fourth quarters of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
those estimates are based on our experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions

revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product or service has been delivered  fees are fixed or determinable  collection is probable and all other significant obligations have been fulfilled 
our revenue is classified into two categories recurring and non recurring 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenue was recurring and was non recurring 
we generate recurring revenue from several sources  including the provision of outsourcing services  such as software hosting and business process management services  and the sale of maintenance and support for our proprietary software products 
recurring outsourced services revenue is typically billed and recognized monthly over the contract term  typically three to seven years 
many of our outsourcing agreements require us to maintain a certain level of operating performance 
recurring software maintenance revenue is typically based on one year renewable contracts 
software maintenance and support revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contract period 
payment for software maintenance received in advance is recorded on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
we generate non recurring revenue from the licensing of our software 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  as amended  aicpa statements of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  and eitf issue  revenue arrangements with 
table of contents multiple deliverables 
software license revenue is recognized upon the execution of a license agreement  upon delivery of the software  when fees are fixed or determinable  when collectibility is probable and when all other significant obligations have been fulfilled 
for software license agreements in which customer acceptance is a material condition of earning the license fees  revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs 
for arrangements containing multiple elements  such as software license fees  consulting services  outsourcing services  and maintenance  and where vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method 
under the residual method  the arrangement fee is recognized as follows the total fair value of the undelivered elements  as indicated by vsoe  is deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with the relevant sections of sop and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
for arrangements in which vsoe does not exist for each undelivered element  including specified upgrades  revenue for the delivered element is deferred and not recognized until vsoe is available for the undelivered element or delivery of each element has occurred 
when multiple products are sold within a discounted arrangement  a proportionate amount of the discount is applied to each product based on each product s fair value or relative list price 
we also generate non recurring revenue from consulting fees for implementation  installation  configuration  customization  business process engineering  data conversion  testing  and training related to the use of our proprietary and third party licensed products 
we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed  if contracted on a time and materials basis  or using the percentage of completion method  if contracted on a fixed fee basis and when we can adequately estimate the cost of the consulting project 
percentage of completion is measured based on cost incurred to date compared to total estimated cost to complete 
when we cannot reasonably estimate the cost to complete  we recognize revenue using the completed contract method until such time that the estimate to complete the consulting project can be reasonably estimated 
we also generate non recurring revenue from set up fees  which are services  hardware  and software associated with preparing our customer connectivity center or a customer s data center in order to ready a specific customer for software hosting services 
we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed using the percentage of completion basis and when we can reasonably estimate the cost of the set up project 
we also generate non recurring revenue from certain one time charges including certain contractual fees such as termination and change of control fees  and we recognize the revenue for these once the termination or change of control is guaranteed and collection is reasonably assured 
upfront fees 
we may pay certain up front fees in connection with the establishment of our hosting and outsourcing services contracts 
the costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the contract as a reduction to revenue  provided that such amounts are recoverable from future revenue under the contract 
if an up front fee is not recoverable from future revenue  or it cannot be offset by contract cancellation penalties paid by the customer  the fee will be written off as an expense in the period it is deemed unrecoverable 
unamortized up front fees as of december  were million 
sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for sales returns to reserve for estimated discounts  pricing adjustments  and other sales allowances 
the reserve is charged to revenue in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance at a level we believe is adequate based on historical experience and current trends 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we base this allowance on estimates after consideration of factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging and bad debt history and our evaluation of the financial condition of the customers 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional sales allowances and bad debt expense may be required 
we typically do not require collateral 
historically  our estimates for sales returns and doubtful account reserves have been adequate to cover accounts receivable exposures 
we continually monitor these reserves and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe actual credits or other allowances may differ from established reserves 
capitalization of software development costs 
we capitalize and subsequently amortize software development costs in accordance with sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
costs incurred internally in the development of our software products are expensed as incurred as research and development expenses until technological feasibility has been established  after which production costs are capitalized and amortized to the cost of revenue over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
on a quarterly basis  we review the future estimated net realizable value for each software product and compare it against the unamortized capital software costs 
to the extent that the unamortized capital software costs exceeds the future estimated net realizable value for a software product  the difference will be written off 
loss on contracts 
during the fourth quarter of and as part of our business planning process for  we decided to wind down our outsourcing services to physician group customers 
as a result of this decision  we estimated that the existing customer agreements from this business would generate a total of million of losses through  until the remaining terms of these agreements expire 
this amount was charged to cost of revenue during the fourth quarter of as a result of our discussions and negotiations with our remaining physician group customers  we have been able to accelerate the termination of our services agreements with certain of these customers 
in addition  we were able to implement cost cutting measures during the second quarter of that have reduced the expected cost to support certain of our remaining physician group customers 
as a result of these actions  we have reversed approximately million and million in the first and second quarters of  respectively  of previously accrued loss on contract charges to cost of revenue 
we will continue to assess this accrual on a quarterly basis to reflect the latest status of these customer agreements known to us 

table of contents additionally  we negotiated a settlement in december regarding out of scope work related to one of our large fixed fee implementation projects 
as a result of this settlement  we estimated that the project would generate a total of million of losses until its completion  which was expected to occur in mid this amount was charged to cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of subsequently  we determined that the large fixed fee implementation project would require a greater effort to complete than previously estimated 
as a result  we accrued an additional million and million loss on contracts charges to cost of revenue in the first and second quarters of  respectively 
no additional loss on contracts charges were accrued in the third quarter of subsequently  in the fourth quarter of  we negotiated a settlement of additional out of scope work  which decreased the total loss on the project and allowed us to reverse approximately  in loss on contracts charges 
this fixed fee implementation was substantially completed by year end anticipated losses on fixed price contracts are accrued in the period when they become known 
restructuring and impairment charges 
as a result of our decision in the fourth quarter of to wind down our outsourcing services to physician groups and to discontinue our outsourcing services to certain non facets payer customers  we estimated that our future net cash flows from the assets used in these businesses will not recover their net book value 
accordingly  a total charge of million was taken as a restructuring and impairment charge in the fourth quarter of  which represented the net book value of these assets 
the assets were written off in the first quarter of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
under financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual or more often if indicators of impairment exist impairment tests using a two step process prescribed in statement the first step looks for indicators of impairment 
if indicators of impairment are revealed in the first step  then the second step is conducted to measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
we adopted statement effective as of january  we performed our annual impairment test on march   and this test did not reveal further indications of impairment 
litigation accruals 
pending unsettled lawsuits involve complex questions of fact and law and may require expenditure of significant funds 
from time to time  we may enter into confidential discussions regarding the potential settlement of such lawsuits  however  there can be no assurance that any such discussions will occur or will result in a settlement 
moreover  the settlement of any pending litigation could require us to incur settlement payments and costs 
although management believes that the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings  claims and litigation involving the company  its subsidiaries  directors and or officers will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition taken as a whole  the results of litigation are inherently uncertain  and material adverse outcomes are possible 
in the period in which a new legal case arises  an expense will be accrued if the settlement amount is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
on a quarterly basis  we review and analyze the adequacy of our accruals for each individual case for all pending litigations 
adjustments are recorded as needed to ensure appropriate levels of reserve 
bonus accruals 
our corporate bonus model is designed to project the level of funding required under the corporate bonus program as approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
a significant portion of the corporate bonus program is based on the company meeting certain financial objectives  such as revenue  earnings per share  and the level of capital spending 
the expense related to the corporate bonus program is accrued in the year of performance and paid in the first quarter following the fiscal year end 
the corporate bonus model is analyzed on a quarterly basis to identify any necessary adjustments to the accrual in order to ensure appropriate funding for year end 
income taxes

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r  which is a revision to sfas and supersedes apb and sfas this statement requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
this statement establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair value based measurement method in 
table of contents accounting for share based payment transactions with employees except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans 
sfas r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
as of the required effective date  all public entities that used the fair value based method for either recognition or disclosure under statement will apply this statement using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under statement for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
for periods before the required effective date  those entities may elect to apply a modified version of the retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by statement as a result  beginning in our third quarter of  we will adopt sfas r and begin reflecting the stock option expense determined under fair value based methods in our statement of operations rather than as pro forma disclosure in the notes to the financial statements 
we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas and we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r 
such adoption may have a substantial impact on our consolidated statements of operations and earnings per share

we may seek additional financing  which may include debt and or equity financing or funding through third party agreements 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
any equity financing may result in dilution to existing stockholders and any debt financing may include restrictive covenants
