the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements filed as part of this form k 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the commercialization and development of unique and uniquely improved products for serious conditions of the eye 
we recently launched in the united states our first product  istalol for the treatment of glaucoma  and our second product  vitrase for use as a spreading agent 
in addition  we have two new drug applications  or ndas  on file with the us food and drug administration  or fda  one for vitrase for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage and one for xibrom for the treatment of ocular inflammation  eye pain and photophobia following cataract surgery 
we continue to expand our commercial infrastructure in connection with the marketing  sale and distribution of our approved products in the united states 
we estimate that approximately  ophthalmologists write the majority of the prescriptions for serious conditions of the eye in the united states 
in connection with our recent launch of vitrase  we plan to expand our sales force to approximately sales representatives by the end of the first quarter of to better reach this physician population 
we further intend to expand our sales force to approximately persons in conjunction with our expected us launch of xibrom  if approved by the fda 
we intend to leverage our commercial capabilities for our other late stage product candidates and additional products we may develop or acquire in the future 
additionally  in january  we sold  shares of our common stock under our universal shelf registration statement in an underwritten public offering for an aggregate purchase price of million  or per share  before offering expenses and underwriting discounts 
we intend to use the proceeds to finance potential acquisitions and licensing of complementary businesses  assets  technologies and products that we may consider from time to time  and fund the continued development of our product candidates  the expansion of our commercial infrastructure to commercialize our approved products and other general corporate purposes  including working capital 
while we currently have two products available for sale  we have not generated any significant revenues from sales of our products 
we have incurred losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of million through december  our losses have resulted primarily from research and development activities  including clinical trials  related general and administrative expenses  a deemed dividend to holders of our preferred stock which is no longer outstanding  and increased selling  general and administrative expenses related to the expansion of our commercial infrastructure 
in addition  we expect our operating expenses to increase substantially from historical levels in connection with our continued expansion of our commercial infrastructure to support the manufacture  marketing  sale and distribution of our approved products 
as a result  we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future until we are able to generate sufficient product revenues to support our then current cost structure 

table of contents results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations generally reflects our transition to a commercial stage company with a primary focus on ophthalmology 
years ended december   and revenue 
revenue was approximately million in  as compared to  in and  in in the third quarter of  we launched our first commercial product  istalol  a once a day  eye drop solution of timolol  a beta blocking agent for the treatment of glaucoma 
net product sales for were million  which was istalol s initial stocking order 
there were no product sales during and we believe that many istalol prescriptions were filled in with generic product at retail pharmacies which limited istalol sales in because of generic substitution  istalol prescription activity in was not in line with our expectations 
as a result  we did not record any istalol product sales during the fourth quarter of in addition  we increased our reserves for sales returns and also for discounts related to managed care and government contracts entered into during the fourth quarter of the increase in reserves in the fourth quarter of resulted in negative net product sales during the fourth quarter of of 
in october  the fda granted istalol a bt rating  which means that prescriptions of istalol cannot be substituted legally at pharmacies with generic timolol maleate products 
as pharmacies comply with istalol s bt rating and cease further generic substitutions  we expect istalol prescription activity to increase in however  we believe that any additional istalol sales in will be dependent upon wholesalers exhausting their current inventories and customer demand for the product 
in addition to product revenues in  we reported license revenue of  in  and  which reflects the amortization for the period of deferred revenue recorded in december for the license fee payment made by otsuka pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
in connection with the license of vitrase in japan for ophthalmic uses in the posterior region of the eye 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold were million in there were no product sales during and cost of products sold included inventory reserves of  related to manufacturing validation inventories of istalol and vitrase produced in conjunction with the development of these products 
upon fda approval of istalol and vitrase in the second quarter of  these validation inventories were capitalized into commercial inventory 
product gross margin for the year ended december  was  or 
we expect product gross margin to improve in commensurate with our product sales growth 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in our research and development expenses to date have consisted primarily of costs associated with the clinical trials of our product candidates  compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  costs for consultants and contract research organizations and costs related to the development of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities for vitrase  istalol and xibrom 
research and development expenses for included million in milestone payments under various licensing agreements 
we generally classify and separate research and development expenditures into amounts related to preclinical research  clinical development and manufacturing development 
in  approximately of our research and development expenditures were for preclinical research  approximately was spent on clinical development and approximately was spent on manufacturing development 
changes in our research and development expenses are primarily due to the following clinical development costs overall clinical costs  which include clinical investigator fees  study monitoring costs and data management  for decreased by million from the decrease in clinical costs in was primarily due to the completion of the xibrom phase iii clinical study 
regulatory costs regulatory costs for increased by million from the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in headcount to support our commercial scale up in preparation for the launch of istalol and vitrase for use as a spreading agent and the fda fees associated with istalol and xibrom  offset by the reimbursement of the nda filing fee paid to the fda in for vitrase for use as a spreading agent 
direct research costs research costs for remained relatively flat as compared to 
table of contents manufacturing development costs contract manufacturing costs for decreased by million from the decrease in manufacturing development costs was the result of obtaining fda approval for vitrase for use as a spreading agent and istalol  which resulted in the capitalization of various amounts into commercial inventory 
medical affairs costs medical affairs costs for increased by  from the medical affairs department was created during to provide additional expertise to the company 
the costs in primarily relate to personnel costs 
our research and development activities reflect our efforts to advance our product candidates through the various stages of pre clinical  clinical and regulatory product development 
the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our development plans are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may affect our research and development expenditures and capital resources 
for instance  the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly depending on a variety of factors including a trial s protocol  the number of patients in the trial  the duration of patient follow up  the number of clinical sites in the trial  and the length of time required enrolling suitable patient subjects 
even if earlier results are positive  we may obtain different results in later stages of development  including failure to show the desired safety or efficacy  which could impact our development expenditures for a particular product candidate 
although we spend a considerable amount of time planning our development activities  we may be required to alter from our plan based on new circumstances or events or our assessment from time to time of a product candidate s market potential  other product opportunities and our corporate priorities 
any deviation from our plan may require us to incur additional expenditures or accelerate or delay the timing of our development spending 
furthermore  as we obtain results from trials and review the path toward regulatory approval  we may elect to discontinue development of certain product candidates in certain indications  in order to focus our resources on more promising candidates or indications 
we expect our research and development expenses in to be substantially the same as selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was primarily attributable to i increases in selling and marketing expenses of million to support the commercial launch of our approved products  ii increases in general and administrative expenses of million due to increased administrative costs related to expanding our commercial operations and other general corporate expenses principally related to accounting and auditing fees associated with the sarbanes oxley act of  and iii one time payment of million to allergan  inc in connection with our reacquisition of all rights to market and sell vitrase for all uses in the united states and other specified markets 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to approximately  in directors and officers liability insurance premiums   in consultant related costs associated with increased activity with our product pipeline   in marketing activities  offset by a million decrease in deferred compensation related to stock based compensation 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses in to increase substantially from in connection with our continued expansion of our commercial infrastructure to support the manufacture  marketing  sale and distribution of our approved products 
stock based compensation 
deferred compensation for stock options granted to employees and directors is the difference between the exercise price and the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock for financial reporting purposes on the date the options were granted 
deferred compensation is included as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  over the vesting period of the related options  which is generally four years 
compensation for stock options granted to non employees has been determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and emerging issues task force eitf consensus no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services  as the fair value of the equity instrument issued and is periodically re measured as the underlying options vest 
stock option compensation for non employees is recorded as the related services are rendered and the value of compensation is periodically re measured as the underlying options vest 

table of contents for the year ended december   we granted stock options to employees to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share  equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the time of grant 
we also granted restricted stock awards to non employee directors to purchase  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share  which awards are subject to forfeiture until the first anniversary of the grant date 
in previous years  we granted stock options to employees with a grant price less than the fair market value at the date of grant 
therefore  we anticipate recording deferred compensation expense of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  related to these option grants 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and directors  we recorded deferred compensation of approximately   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively  and recorded amortization of   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income 
interest income was  in   in and  in the increase in interest income in is attributable to higher average cash balances on hand as compared to  primarily as a result of our receipt of million of net proceeds in connection with our november equity financing and million of net proceeds in connection with our august equity financings 
the increase in interest income in over the prior year was also primarily attributable to higher average cash balances on hand  primarily as a result of our receipt of of net proceeds in connection with our november equity financing and million of net proceeds in connection with our november equity financing 
interest expense 
interest expense was approximately  in   in and  in interest expense incurred during was primarily attributable to the interest accrued on the million liability due to allergan as a result of our reacquisition of all rights to market and sell vitrase in the united states and other specified markets 
the interest expense incurred during was primarily attributable to the interest paid on the financing of our directors and officers insurance premiums 
interest expense incurred during was primarily attributable to approximately  related to the amortization of the fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the bridge loan in september income taxes 
we incurred net operating losses in  and and consequently did not pay any federal  state or foreign income taxes 
at december   we had federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which we have fully reserved due to the uncertainty of realization 
our federal tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
our california tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
we also have federal and california research tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research tax credits will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
our california research tax credit carryforwards do not expire and will carryforward indefinitely until utilized 
in addition  we have california manufacturer s investment credit of approximately  that will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
during  a change in ownership  as described in the internal revenue code section  did occur and will limit our ability to utilize the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in the future 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth a summary of our unaudited quarterly operating results for each of the last eight quarters in the period ended december  this data has been derived from our unaudited consolidated interim financial statements which  in our opinion  have been prepared on substantially the same basis as the audited financial statements contained elsewhere in this report and include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information for the periods presented

net product sales for were million  which was istalol s initial stocking order 
there were no product sales during and research development expenses 
during  our quarterly research and development expenses consisted primarily of costs associated with clinical trials  compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  consultants  contract research organizations and the development of commercial manufacturing capabilities for vitrase  istalol and xibrom 
the quarterly decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to the completion of clinical development and gaining product approvals 
the overall decrease was offset by million milestone payments under various licensing agreements 
during  our quarterly research and development expenses increased primarily as a result of the commencement of the xibrom phase iii clinical trial and increased development and or manufacturing spending related to vitrase  istalol  and xibrom 
selling  general administrative expenses 
during  our quarterly selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of an increase in marketing expenses associated with our commercial launch of our approved products  an increase in general and administrative expenses associated with costs related to expanding our commercial operations and other general corporate expenses principally related to accounting and auditing fees associated with the sarbanes oxley act of  and a million milestone payment to allergan recorded in the third quarter of in connection with our reacquisition of all rights to market and sell vitrase for all uses in the united states and other specified markets 
during  our quarterly selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of additional personnel expenses with the hiring of two additional key management employees and two additional executive employees  and other related facilities expenses

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s most subjective and complex judgment due to the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable as of the date when made  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operations and or financial condition 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that most impact our consolidated financial statements are as described below 
revenue recognition product sales 
we recognize revenue from product sales  in accordance with financial accounting standard no 
fas revenue recognition when right of return exists  when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  when title has passed  the price is fixed or determinable  and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
we recognize product revenue net of estimated allowances for discounts  returns  rebates and chargebacks 
if actual future payments for allowances for discounts  returns  rebates and chargebacks exceed the estimates we made at the 
table of contents time of sale  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted 
such estimates require our most subjective and complex judgement due to the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
for instance  because of generic substitution  istalol prescription activity during the fourth quarter of was not in line with our expectations 
as a result  we did not record any istalol product sales during the fourth quarter of in addition  we increased our reserves for sales returns and also for discounts related to managed care and government contracts entered into during the fourth quarter of the increase in reserves in the fourth quarter of resulted in negative net product sales during the fourth quarter of 
changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operations and or financial condition 
we are obligated to accept from customers the return of pharmaceuticals that have reached their expiration date 
we authorize returns for damaged products and exchanges for expired products in accordance with our return goods policy and procedures  and have established reserves for such amounts at the time of sale 
we recently launched our first marketed product  istalol  in the third quarter of and to date actual istalol returns have not exceeded our estimated allowances for returns 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable as of the date when made  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
our financial position  results of operations and cash flows may be materially and negatively impacted if actual returns exceed our estimated allowances for returns 
license revenue 
we recognize revenue consistent with the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines in the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
amounts received for product and technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone  unless the amounts received are creditable against royalties or we have ongoing performance obligations 
royalty revenue will be recognized upon sale of the related products  provided the royalty amounts are fixed and determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
inventory inventory consists of currently marketed products 
inventory primarily represents raw materials used in production and finished goods inventory on hand  valued at standard cost 
inventories are reviewed periodically for slow moving or obsolete status 
if a launch of a new product is delayed  inventory may not be fully utilized and could be subject to impairment  at which point we would record a reserve to adjust inventory to its net realizable value 
inventory relates to both istalol  for the treatment of glaucoma  vitrase  lyophilized  usp units multi purpose vial and vitrase usp units ml for use as a spreading agent to facilitate the absorption and dispersion of other injected drugs 
inventories are stated at standard cost first in  first out 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and working capital of million 
during january  we completed a public offering of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of million before offering expenses and underwriting discounts 

table of contents we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private equity sales and the sale of our common stock in our initial and follow on public offerings 
we received net proceeds of million from the private sale of preferred stock in march  million from our initial public offering in august  million from the private sale of common stock in december  million from a license fee payment in december  million from the issuance of promissory notes in september  million from our pipe transaction in november and million from our follow on public offering in november  million from our registered direct offerings in august and million from our follow on public offering in january the private investment in public equity  or pipe  transaction in november consisted of a private placement of  shares of our common stock for the aggregate purchase price of approximately million  or per share  and warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock for an exercise price of per share  before offering expenses and fees 
the follow on public offering in november consisted of the sale of  shares of our common stock for the aggregate purchase price of million  or per share  before offering expenses and underwriting discounts 
in april  we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the sec providing for the offering from time to time of up to  of our securities  which may consist of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  or debt securities 
on august  we sold  shares of common stock under our universal shelf registration statement on form s for an aggregate purchase price of million  or per share  before placement agency fees and other offering expenses 
on august   we sold an additional  shares of common stock under our universal shelf registration statement for an aggregate purchase price of million  or per share  before offering expenses 
in january  we sold  shares of our common stock under our universal shelf registration statement in an underwritten public offering for an aggregate purchase price of million  or per share  before offering expenses and underwriting discounts 
during  we used million of cash for operations principally as a result of the net loss of million partially offset by non cash compensation expense of  the transfer of equipment for technology of  and the change in other liabilities of million  relative to the million liability incurred in connection with our reacquisition of all rights to market and sell vitrase for all uses in the united states and other specified markets million was paid prior to december  
during  we used million of cash for operations principally as a result of the net loss of million partially offset by non cash compensation expense of  during  we used million of cash for operations principally as a result of the net loss of million partially offset by non cash compensation expense of million 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled million during compared to million of cash used in investing activities during during   of cash was used in investing activities 
cash provided for investing activities in is primarily attributable to the sale of an aggregate of  shares of common stock in two registered direct offerings in august at an aggregate purchase price of million before offering expenses and fees  which was subsequently invested in short term investments 
cash used for investing activities in is primarily attributable to the follow on public offering of  shares of common stock in november at an aggregate purchase price of million before offering expenses  fees and discounts 
during  the net cash invested was primarily attributable to the purchase of short term investments net cash provided by financing activities totaled million during compared to million in and million in the net cash provided by financing activities in is primarily attributable to million net cash from the sale of an aggregate of  shares of common stock in two registered direct offerings in august at an aggregate purchase price of million 
the net cash provided by financing activities in is primarily attributable to million net proceeds from the public sale of  shares of common stock in november  while the cash provided by financing activities in is primarily attributable to million net proceeds from the issuance of a bridge loan in september and the million net proceeds from the pipe transaction in november we may be required to raise additional capital in the future through collaborative agreements  pipe related financings  and various other public or private equity or debt financings 
if we are required to raise additional capital in the future  there can be no assurance that the additional financing will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
we continually evaluate new opportunities for late stage or currently marketed complementary product candidates and  if and when appropriate  intend to pursue such opportunities through the acquisitions of companies  products  or technology and our own research and development activities 
our ability to execute on such opportunities in some circumstances will be dependent  in part  upon our ability to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms 
there can be no assurance that funds from these sources will be available when needed or  if available  will be on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 

table of contents our actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the success of the commercialization of our products 
sales and marketing activities  and expansion of our commercial infrastructure  related to our approved products and product candidates  the results of our clinical trials and requirements to conduct additional clinical trials  the rate of progress of our research and development programs  the time and expense necessary to obtain regulatory approvals  activities and payments in connection with potential acquisitions of companies  products or technology  competitive  technological  market and other developments  and our ability to establish and maintain collaborative relationships  tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations long term liability obligations total visionex visionex was established in  under the laws of singapore  to engage in clinical  regulatory and marketing activities 
during  visionex obtained from us the exclusive rights to register  import  market  sell and distribute vitrase and a product called keraform in east asian markets  excluding japan and korea  for which visionex paid us million 
prior to our acquisition of visionex discussed below  investors who owned of ista shares controlled of visionex shares 
in march  we acquired visionex by entering into an agreement with visionex shareholders whereby we issued  shares of our series c preferred stock  convertible into  shares of our common stock  to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of visionex 
we assigned a fair value of per share to the  shares of series c preferred stock issued to effect the acquisition  at which time we recorded a deemed dividend of million to recognize the excess of the value of the shares issued over the net assets acquired 
under singapore tax law  visionex was subject to a withholding tax on a million license that it paid to us in connection with a license to market  sell and distribute our vitrase and corneaplasty products in certain countries in southeast asia 
this withholding tax was waived by the economic development board  or edb  of singapore subject to various conditions  including a commitment that visionex would implement a proposed project to expand its business activities in singapore to the benefit of the local economy 
we substantially wound down visionex operations in july  and the proposed project was never implemented 
based upon a letter we received from the edb and our assessment of our obligations with the edb  management does not believe that we will be required to pay any withholding tax or related obligations in connection with the license fee 
however  if we are required to pay this withholding tax  our financial condition will suffer 

table of contents new accounting pronouncement in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r revised  share based payment 
the revisions to sfas no require compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
in addition  liability awards will be re measured each reporting period 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
statement r replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
for public entities  the provisions of the statement are effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june   however early adoption is allowed 
we expect to adopt the provisions of the new statement in the third fiscal quarter of the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we cannot accurately estimate at this time the impact of adopting sfas no 
r as it will depend on our market price  our assumptions used and levels of share based payments granted in future periods 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage are to be recognized as current period charges 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
seeking to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
the average duration of all of our investments in was less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair market value of our interest sensitive financial investments 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our investment income  while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense 
historically  and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
we have operated primarily in the united states 
accordingly  we have not had any significant exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
visionex s functional currency is the singapore dollar and a portion of visionex s business was conducted in currencies other than the singapore dollar prior to the wind down of operations in july as a result  currency fluctuations between the singapore dollar and the currencies in which visionex had done business will cause foreign currency translation gains and losses 
we do not expect our foreign currency translation gains or losses to be material 
we do not currently engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions to manage our foreign currency exposure
