additionally  our games are made available through various internet and online networks 
our sales to key customers wal mart  target  best buy  gamestop  and electronics boutique accounted for approximately     and respectively  of net revenues for the year ended march  key challenges the video game software industry has experienced an increased rate of change and complexity in the technological innovations of video game hardware and software 
in addition to these technological innovations  there has been greater competition for shelf space and creative talent as well as increased buyer selectivity 
as a result  the video game industry has become increasingly hit driven  which has led to higher per game production budgets  longer and more complex development processes  and generally shorter product life cycles 
the importance of the timely release of hit titles  as well as the increased scope and complexity of the product development process  have increased the need for disciplined product development processes that limit costs and overruns 
this  in turn  has increased the importance of leveraging the technologies  characters or storylines of existing hit titles into additional video game software franchises in order to spread development costs among multiple products 
in this environment  we are determined to achieve balances between internal and external development  and licensed and proprietary products 

table of contents company reorganization historically  our sales growth and profitability have not been at the same level as our more successful competitors 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced that as part of an overall strategic plan  we would implement structural  financial  and creative restructuring initiatives with the goal of improving profitability and competitive position 
specifically  we and our majority stockholder are considering ways to simplify our corporate structure 
the following are key steps that management has taken as of march  restructuring during the fourth quarter of fiscal  following the guidance established under financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we recorded restructuring expenses of million  which include the termination of several key executives as well as severance and other charges related to the closing of the beverly  ma  and santa monica  ca  publishing studios and the transfer of all publishing operations to the new york office 
the costs include severance and retention expenses  expenses associated with the modification of stock option agreements for terminated executives  and other miscellaneous transition costs 
we expect to incur an additional million to million over the next twelve month period in order to complete management s plan 
discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal  following the guidance established under fasb statement no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  management committed to a plan to divest of our humongous entertainment development studio and its operations 
the sale is expected to occur in the twelve months following the end of fiscal it is unknown at march  the amount of the gain or loss that will be recorded on the sale  once completed 
the assets and liabilities of humongous are presented separately on our consolidated balance sheets  additionally  its results for the periods presented are disclosed as discontinued operations on the face of the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss 
a summary of the net revenues and loss income from discontinued operations of humongous entertainment for the years presented in our selected financial data is as follows in thousands nine months years ended ended years ended june  march  march  unaudited unaudited net revenues loss income from discontinued operations critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts and notes receivable  inventories  intangible assets  investments  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other 
table of contents assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
sales returns  price protection  other customer related allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts sales are recorded net of estimated future returns  price protection and other customer related allowances 
we are not contractually obligated to accept returns  however  based on facts and circumstances at the time a customer may request approval for a return  we may permit the return or exchange of products sold to certain customers 
in addition  we may provide price protection  co operative advertising and other allowances to certain customers in accordance with industry practice 
these reserves are determined based on historical experience  market acceptance of products produced  retailer inventory levels  budgeted customer allowances  the nature of the title and existing commitments to customers 
although management believes it provides adequate reserves with respect to these items  actual activity could vary from management s estimates and such variances could have a material impact on reported results 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments when due or within a reasonable period of time thereafter 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required 
for the nine months ended march  unaudited and  and the years ended march  unaudited   and  we recorded allowances for bad debts  returns  price protection and other customer promotional programs of approximately million  million  million  million  and million  respectively 
as of march  and march   the aggregate reserves against accounts receivable for bad debts  returns  price protection and other customer promotional programs were approximately million and million  respectively 
inventories we write down our inventories for estimated slow moving or obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and estimated market value based upon assumed market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those assumed by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
for the nine months ended march  unaudited and  and the years ended march  unaudited   and  we recorded obsolescence expense of approximately million  million  million  million  and million  respectively 
as of march  and march   the aggregate reserve against inventories was approximately million and million  respectively 
research and product development costs research and product development costs relate to the design  development  and testing of new software products  whether internally or externally developed 
rapid technological innovation  shelf space competition  shorter product life cycles and buyer selectivity have made it difficult to determine the likelihood of individual product acceptance and success 
as a result  we follow the policy of expensing our research and product development costs including external developer royalty advances milestone payments as incurred 
generally  developers are paid an advance upon the signing of a contract with us 
subsequent payments are due as the specific contractual milestones are met by the developer and approved by us 
the timing of when these contracts are entered into and when milestone payments are made could vary significantly from budgeted amounts and  because these payments are expensed as incurred  they could have a material impact on reported results in a given period 
due to recently implemented enhancements in our internal project planning and acceptance process and anticipated additional improvements in our ability to assess post release consumer acceptance  we are currently considering a change from expensing such costs when incurred to a method of deferral and amortization over each product s life cycle 
should management change its method of accounting for product development costs  such change will be implemented prospectively 
management believes that the ability to amortize such costs over the product s life cycle will result in a better matching of costs and revenues 

table of contents licenses licenses for intellectual property are capitalized as assets upon the execution of the contract when no significant obligation for performance remains with the third party 
if significant obligations remain  the asset is capitalized when due as opposed to when the contract is executed 
these licenses are amortized at the licensor s royalty rate over unit sales 
management evaluates the carrying value of these capitalized licenses and records an impairment charge as research and product development expense in the period management determines that such capitalized amounts are not expected to be realized 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction  a valuation allowance is established 
the estimated effective tax rate is adjusted for the tax related to significant unusual items 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate 
as of march   we have combined net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes 
these loss carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income  if any  and will expire beginning in the years through we experienced an ownership change in as a result of the acquisition by iesa 
under section of the internal revenue code  when there is an ownership change  the pre ownership change loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation which could reduce or defer the utilization of these losses 
pre acquisition losses of approximately million are subject to an annual limitation approximately million 
a full valuation allowance has been recorded against the net deferred tax asset based on our historical operating results and the conclusion that it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized 
management reassesses its position with regard to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
in december  the fasb issued staff position fsp  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creations act of ajca 
the ajca introduces a limited time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
fsp provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision 
as we have no earnings to repatriate from our foreign subsidiaries  we have determined that the issuance of fsp has no effect on our financial position and results of operations 
related party transactions we are involved in numerous related party transactions with iesa and its subsidiaries 
these related party transactions include  but are not limited to  the purchase and sale of product  game development  administrative and support services and distribution agreements

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended march  increased approximately million  or  to million from million in the comparable period

interest expense  net interest expense  net  increased approximately million to million for the nine months ended march  from million in the comparable period 
this increase in the nine months ended march  is due from a higher level of average borrowings in as compared to the period attributable to the new medium term loan with iesa and the senior credit facility with gecc  offset partially by a repayment of amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility with bnp paribas and interest income earned on advances to related parties 
benefit from provision for income taxes during the nine months ended march   we recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately million as compared to a million benefit from income taxes in the prior comparable period 
the charge in the period relates to estimated federal and state alternative minimum tax provisions of million to be paid by us based on our current taxable income 
this provision is offset by million in federal income tax benefits resulting from loss carryback refund claims filed in the current period with respect to our fiscal federal income tax return and an amended federal income tax return 
for the nine months ended march   we received a tax benefit of million based on federal tax law changes enabling us to carryback our june  loss and recover taxes paid in liquidity and capital resources overview as of march   management believes that we have sufficient capital resources to finance our operational requirements for the next twelve months  including the funding of the development  production  marketing and sale of new products  the purchases of equipment  and the acquisition of certain intellectual property rights for future products 
however  in order to complete the redirection of the focus of our product portfolio  we will need to make significant investment in the expansion of our product development efforts 
this investment is critical in order to maintain and grow our business  keep up to date with changing technology including new hardware platforms scheduled to be introduced in late and in  attract premier development partners  and secure profitable intellectual properties 
our capital raising needs are discussed with our majority stockholder with respect to appropriate timing and structure 
however  we cannot guarantee that this capital will be raised or that we will be successful in our strategic initiatives 
if we are not successful  management is prepared to take various actions which may include  but not be limited to  a reduction in our expenditures for internal and external new product development and further reduction in overhead expenses 
these actions  should they become necessary  may result in a significant reduction in the size of our operations 

table of contents cash flows in thousands march  march  cash working capital year year ended ended march  march  cash provided by used in operating activities cash used in provided by investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash net increase in cash during the year ended march   cash usage of million was caused by operating activities reflecting increased payments of trade payables and royalties payable  and increased trade receivables due to the planned late march release of dragon ball z sagas 
this usage is further compounded by million in payments made in the fourth quarter due to management s restructuring plan and million cash usage from funding our discontinued operations 
investing activities for the year ended march  created a cash inflow of approximately million as compared to cash usage of million in the comparable prior period 
this increase in cash inflow is attributable to our decision to no longer make advances to related parties and payments received in the current period for related party notes receivable issued in the comparable prior period 
the comparable period had cash usage of approximately million from related party advances 
in the year ended march   we received payments on certain related party notes receivable  which were issued in  for approximately million 
furthermore  during the year ended march   we issued and received payment on a secured promissory note totaling million 
during the year ended march   our financing activities resulted in a nominal usage of cash  while financing activities during the period provided cash of approximately million 
this decrease in cash is primarily attributable to the million of proceeds received from our equity offering in the period 
there were no material financing activities in the year ended march  we expect continued volatility in the use of cash due to seasonality of the business  receivable payment cycles and quarterly working capital needs to finance our publishing businesses and growth objectives 
our outstanding accounts receivable balance varies significantly on a quarterly basis due to the seasonality of our business and the timing of new product releases 
there were no significant changes in the credit terms with customers during the twelve month period 
we do not currently have any material commitments with respect to any capital expenditures 
however  we do have commitments to pay royalty and license advances  milestone payments  and operating lease obligations 
our ability to maintain sufficient levels of cash could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  customer demand and acceptance of our new versions of our titles on existing platforms and our titles on new platforms  our ability to collect our receivables as they become due  risks of product returns  successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales goals  seasonality in operating results  fluctuations in market conditions and the other risks described in the risk factors see risk factors on page 
we are also party to various litigation arising in the course of our business 
management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents credit facilities hsbc loan and security agreement on may   we obtained a one year million revolving credit facility revolving credit facility with hsbc business credit usa inc hsbc  pursuant to a loan and security agreement  to fund our working capital and general corporate needs 
loans under the revolving credit facility are determined based on percentages of our eligible receivables and eligible inventory for certain seasonal peak periods 
the revolving credit facility bears interest at prime for daily borrowings or libor plus for borrowings with a maturity of days or greater 
we are required to pay a commitment fee of on the average unused portion of the facility quarterly in arrears and closing costs of approximately million 
the revolving credit facility contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain enumerated ebitda  tangible net worth  and working capital minimums 
in addition  amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are secured by liens on substantially all of our present and future assets  including accounts receivable  inventory  general intangibles  fixtures  and equipment and excluding certain non us assets 
gecc senior credit facility on november   we obtained a month million senior credit facility with gecc to fund our working capital and general corporate needs  as well as to fund advances to atari interactive and paradigm  each a related party 
loans under the senior credit facility were based on a borrowing base comprised of the value of our accounts receivable and short term marketable securities 
the senior credit facility bore interest at prime plus for daily borrowings or libor plus for borrowings with a maturity of days or greater 
this senior credit facility expired on may  and was replaced by the hsbc revolving credit facility 
contractual obligations as of march   royalty and license advance obligations  milestone payments and future minimum lease obligations under non cancelable operating and capital leases are summarized as follows in thousands payments due by period fiscal years ended march  thereafter total royalty and license advances milestone payments operating lease obligations capital lease obligations total we have committed to pay advance payments under certain royalty and license agreements 
the payments of these obligations are dependent on the delivery of the contracted services by the developers 
milestone payments represent royalty advances to developers for products that are currently in development 
although milestone payments are not guaranteed  we expect to make these payments if all deliverables and milestones are met timely and accurately 
we account for our leases as operating leases  with expiration dates ranging from fiscal through fiscal these are future minimum annual rental payments required under the leases  including a related party sub lease with atari interactive 
we entered into several capital leases for computer equipment in the third quarter of fiscal per fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases  we account for capital leases by recording them at the present value of the total future lease payments 
they are amortized using the straight line method over the minimum lease term 

table of contents iesa liquidity as of the date of this report  iesa beneficially owns  directly and indirectly  approximately of our stock 
iesa has incurred significant continuing operating losses and is highly leveraged 
iesa has taken steps to improve its financial situation  including i restructuring its outstanding debt obligations such that the debt amount is reduced and the debt maturity schedule is more favorable  ii reducing operating expenses  iii raising capital by selling through cush  of its shares in atari  pursuant to a registration statement  iv entering into banking arrangements to fund operations and position itself for the new hardware cycle  v selling assets  such as its rights in the civilization franchise and certain of its rights under its previous license with hasbro  and vi entering into production fund agreements to finance certain game development projects 
however  iesa has not yet completed all of the actions it plans to take in order to improve its operations and reduce its debt 
as a result  iesa s current ability to fund  among other things  its subsidiaries operations is diminished 
there can be no assurance that iesa will complete sufficient actions to assure its future financial stability 
if iesa is unable to complete its action plan and address its liquidity problems and fund its working capital needs  iesa would likely be unable to fund its and its subsidiaries video game development operations  including that of atari interactive 
therefore  our results of operations could be materially impaired if iesa fails to fund atari interactive  as any delay or cessation in product development could materially decrease our revenue from the distribution of atari interactive and iesa products 
such a reduction of our revenues  among other things  could result in a breach of one or more of the covenants contained in our revolving credit facility with gecc 
if the above contingencies occurred  we probably would be forced to take actions that could include  but would not necessarily be limited to  a significant reduction in our expenditures for internal and external new product development and the implementation of a comprehensive cost reduction program to reduce our overhead expenses 
these actions  should they become necessary  could result in a significant reduction in the size of our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and cash flows 
at present there can be no assurance regarding any of the foregoing contingencies and management will continue to monitor these developments closely 
iesa distributes our products in europe  asia  and certain other regions  and pays us royalties in this respect 
iesa also develops products which we distribute in the us  canada  and mexico  and for which we pay royalties to iesa 
both iesa and atari interactive are material sources of products which we market in the united states and canada 
atari interactive is the source of approximately of our net revenue and we generate approximately of our net revenue from royalties on iesa s distribution of our products in europe  asia  and certain other regions 
additionally  though atari is a separate and independent legal entity and we are not a party to  or a guarantor of  and have no obligations or liability in respect of iesa s indebtedness except that we have guaranteed the beverly  ma lease obligation of atari interactive  because iesa owns the majority of our stock  potential investors and current and potential business trade partners may view iesa s financial situation as relevant to an assessment of atari 
therefore  if iesa is unable to address its financial issues  it may taint our relationship with our suppliers and distributors  damage our business reputation  affect our ability to generate business and enter into agreements on financially favorable terms  and otherwise impair our ability to raise and generate capital 
iesa continues to focus on ways to address and improve its financial situation

statement no 
r is a revision of statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
statement no

 which generally resulted in no compensation expense recorded in the financial statements related to the issuance of equity awards to employees 
statement no 
r establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all companies to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for generally all share based payment transactions with employees

under this application  companies are required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the required effective date and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
the provisions of statement no

the ajca introduces a limited time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
fsp provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision 
as we have no earnings to repatriate from our foreign subsidiaries  we have determined that the issuance of fsp has no effect on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our carrying value of cash  accounts receivable  related party notes receivable  accounts payable  accrued liabilities  royalties payable  assets and liabilities of discontinued operations  and amounts due to and from related parties are a reasonable approximation of their fair value 
foreign currency exchange rates we earn royalties on sales of our product sold internationally 
these revenues  which are based on various foreign currencies and are billed and paid in us dollars  represented million of our revenue for the year ended march  we also purchase certain of our inventories from foreign developers and pay royalties primarily denominated in euros to iesa from the sale of iesa products in north america 
while we do not hedge against foreign exchange rate fluctuations  our business in this regard is subject to certain risks  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
our future results could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
as of march   foreign subsidiaries represented and of consolidated net revenues and total assets  respectively 
we also recorded approximately million in operating expenses attributed to foreign operations related primarily to a development studio located outside the united states 
currently  substantially all of our business is conducted in the united states where revenues and expenses are transacted in us dollars 
as a result  the majority of our results of operations are not subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations
