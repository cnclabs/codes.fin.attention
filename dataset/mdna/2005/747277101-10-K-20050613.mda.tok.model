we serve customers with solutions based on various storage area network  or san  technologies 
our products are currently based on fibre channel  small computer systems interface  or scsi  and internet scsi  or iscsi  standards and we expect that future products may also be based on technology standards such as serial attached scsi  or sas 
we produce the controller chips  management enclosure chips  host bus adapters  or hbas and fabric switches that provide the connectivity infrastructure for every size of storage network 
our ability to serve the storage industry stems from our highly leveraged product line that addresses virtually every connection point in a san infrastructure solution 
on the server side of the san  we provide enclosure management products  hba technology on the motherboard fibre down technology  baseboard management solutions  fibre channel hbas and iscsi hbas 
connecting servers to storage  we provide the network infrastructure with a full suite of fibre channel switches 
on the storage side of the network  we provide controller chips for redundant array of inexpensive disks  or raid  storage systems 
these include fibre channel host port connections and raid controller to fibre channel and scsi disk drive port connections 
in addition  we are an independent designer  developer and supplier of enterprise scsi and fibre channel disk controllers 
our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and through our authorized distributors 
these connectivity solutions are incorporated into a variety of products from oem customers  including cisco systems  inc  dell computer corporation  emc corporation  fujitsu limited  hitachi  hewlett packard company  international business machines corporation  network appliance  inc  quantum corporation  storage technology corporation  sun microsystems  inc and many others 
we maintain a fifty two fifty three week fiscal year ending on the sunday nearest march fiscal year comprised fifty three weeks  with the additional week included in the fourth fiscal quarter 
fiscal years and each comprised fifty two weeks 
fiscal year and fourth quarter financial highlights and other information during fiscal  we established new records for annual net revenues and net income 
net revenues during fiscal of million were up from last year  net income of million in fiscal increased from the prior year 
the results for fiscal were highlighted by a increase in fibre channel product revenues and an improvement in gross profit percentage of basis points to 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our total net revenues increased sequentially by from the third quarter of fiscal fibre channel revenues during the fourth quarter increased 
revenues derived from scsi products increased sequentially during the fourth quarter due to increased demand for our scsi chip products 
overall  sales of our hard disk drive controller chips increased by sequentially  including strong growth in both the fibre channel and scsi technologies 
our long term outlook for our core fibre channel business remains favorable 
based on a foundation of design wins in existing markets  as well as emerging markets such as the small to medium business market  we continue to expect favorable growth momentum for our fibre channel products 

table of contents a summary of the key factors and significant events which impacted our financial performance during the fourth quarter of fiscal are as follows net revenues of million for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased sequentially by million  or  from the million reported in the third quarter of fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was for the fourth quarter of fiscal  declining basis points from the reported in the third quarter of fiscal this change in our gross profit percentage was attributable to product mix 
although we experienced an increase in our gross profit percentage for fiscal  we continue to expect downward pressure on our gross profit percentage and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our gross profit percentage consistent with historical trends and it may decline in the future 
operating income as a percentage of net revenues was for the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to in the third quarter of fiscal net income of million  or per diluted share  increased sequentially from the million  or per diluted share  in the third quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repurchased million of our common stock in the open market under our corporate stock repurchase program 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million at april  increased million from the balance at the end of the third quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter  we generated million of cash from operations 
working capital of million at april  increased million during the fourth quarter primarily due to our net income and the related cash generated from operations 
accounts receivable was million as of april   compared to million at december  days sales outstanding dso in receivables as of april  decreased to days from days as of december  our accounts receivable and dso are primarily affected by the linearity of shipments within the quarter and collections performance 
based on our customers procurement models and our current customer mix  we expect that dso will range between and days during fiscal there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our dso consistent with historical trends and it may increase in the future 
inventories were million as of april   compared to million as of december  our annualized inventory turns in the fourth quarter of fiscal of turns declined from the turns in the third quarter of fiscal  principally due to the increase in inventories related to the buildup to satisfy customer requirements  including the expected level of customer demand from our hubs at the end of the fourth quarter 

table of contents results of operations net revenues a summary of the components of our net revenues is as follows in millions net revenues fibre channel products scsi products other total net revenues percentage of net revenues fibre channel products scsi products other total net revenues the global marketplace for sans continues to expand in response to the information storage requirements of enterprise business environments  as well as the emerging market for san based solutions for small and medium sized business 
this market expansion has resulted in increased volume shipments of our fibre channel products 
however  the san market has been characterized by rapid advances in technology and related product performance  which has generally resulted in declining average selling prices over time 
our revenues have generally been favorably affected by increases in volume shipments as a result of market expansion and increases in market share and the release of new products  which tend to have higher average selling prices than the products they are replacing 
the favorable effect on our revenues as a result of increases in volume has been partially offset by the impact of declining prices 
our net revenues are derived primarily from the sale of fibre channel and scsi based products 
we also license certain designs and receive royalty revenues and non recurring engineering fees 
net revenues for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal the increase was the result of a million  or  increase in fibre channel product revenues  due principally to a increase in shipments of fibre channel hbas compared to the prior year 
this volume increase was partially offset by lower average selling prices 
the increase in fibre channel product revenues was partially offset by a million  or  decrease in sales of scsi products 
we continue to expect sales of scsi products to decrease primarily due to the transition in our hard disk drive controller product line from scsi to sas technology 
net revenues for fiscal included million of other revenue  compared to million of other revenue recorded in the prior year 
other revenue includes iscsi product revenues  royalties  non recurring engineering fees and service fees 
other revenues are unpredictable and we do not expect them to be significant to our overall revenues 
net revenues for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal the increase was primarily the result of a million  or  increase in fibre channel product revenues  due principally to increased shipments of hbas and switches  which volume increases aggregated and  respectively 
these volume increases were partially offset by lower average selling prices 
the increase in fibre channel net revenues was partially offset by a million decrease in sales of scsi products  primarily due to the continued technology transition in our hard disk drive controller product line 
net revenues for fiscal included million of other revenues  compared to million of other revenues recorded in the prior year 
a small number of our customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenues  and we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
our top ten customers accounted for  and of net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 

table of contents a summary of our customers  including their manufacturing subcontractors  that represent or more of our net revenues during each of the fiscal years is as follows fujitsu ibm sun microsystems hewlett packard hitachi less than of net revenues 
we believe that our major customers continually evaluate whether or not to purchase products from alternative or additional sources 
additionally  customers economic and market conditions frequently change 
accordingly  there can also be no assurance that a major customer will not reduce  delay or eliminate its purchases from us 
any such reduction  delay or loss of purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
export revenues primarily to pacific rim countries for fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal  including a million increase in the asia pacific region and a million increase in europe 
export revenues in fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal  primarily due to increased sales of fibre channel hbas in the united kingdom and the asia pacific region 
as a percentage of net revenues  export revenues accounted for  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
export revenues are denominated in us dollars 
revenues by geographic area are presented based upon the country of destination 
no other country represented or more of net revenues for any of the fiscal years presented 
net revenues by geographic area are as follows in millions united states japan united kingdom rest of world gross profit gross profit represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of purchased products including silicon chips from third party manufacturers  assembly and test services  and costs associated with product procurement  inventory management and product quality 
a summary of our gross profit and related percentage of net revenues is as follows in millions gross profit percentage of net revenues gross profit for fiscal increased million or  from gross profit for fiscal the gross profit percentage for fiscal increased basis points from the prior year to 
the increase in gross profit percentage during fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to favorable shifts in product mix and technology mix  including increased sales of higher margin fibre channel products 
in addition  the gross profit percentage was favorably affected by cost efficiencies realized from the increase in production during fiscal 
table of contents during fiscal  gross profit increased million or  from gross profit for fiscal the gross profit percentage for fiscal increased basis points from the prior year to 
the increase in gross profit percentage during for fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to favorable shifts in product mix and technology mix  including increased sales of higher margin fibre channel products 
in addition  the gross profit percentage was favorably affected by cost efficiencies realized from the increase in production and improved inventory management during fiscal our ability to maintain our current gross profit percentage can be significantly affected by factors such as the results of our investment in engineering and development activities  supply costs  the worldwide semiconductor foundry capacity  the mix of products shipped  competitive price pressures  the timeliness of volume shipments of new products  the level of royalties received and our ability to achieve manufacturing cost reductions 
we anticipate that it will be increasingly difficult to reduce manufacturing costs 
also  royalty revenues have been irregular or unpredictable 
as a result of these and other factors  it may be difficult to maintain our gross profit percentage consistent with historical trends and it may decline in the future 
operating expenses our operating expenses are summarized in the following table in millions operating expenses engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses percentage of net revenues engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefit costs  development related engineering and material costs  occupancy costs and related computer support costs 
engineering and development expenses of million for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in engineering and development expenses in fiscal was due primarily to a million increase in compensation and related benefit costs as a result of headcount increases and a million increase in materials and outside services costs 
the increase in our headcount and associated costs during fiscal was primarily the result of our continued development efforts in support of new products 
engineering and development expenses included million in fiscal and million in fiscal of non cash stock based compensation costs related to our acquisition of little mountain group  inc in january these non cash charges ended during the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  engineering and development expenses of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in engineering and development expenses in fiscal was due primarily to a million increase in compensation and related benefit costs 
the increase in our headcount and associated costs during fiscal was primarily the result of our continued development efforts in support of products based on the fibre channel and iscsi technologies 
we believe continued investments in engineering and development activities are critical to achieving future design wins  expansion of our customer base and revenue growth opportunities 
as a result of continued and increasing costs associated with new product development  we expect engineering and development 
table of contents expenses will continue to increase in the future  excluding the non cash stock based compensation costs noted above 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefit costs  sales commissions  promotional activities and travel for sales and marketing personnel 
sales and marketing expenses of million for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal was due primarily to a million increase in compensation and related benefit costs associated with the continued expansion of our sales and marketing groups and a million increase in promotional activities directed at increasing market awareness and acceptance of our products 
during fiscal  sales and marketing expenses of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal was due primarily to a million increase in promotional activities  a million increase in compensation and related benefit costs associated with the continued expansion of our sales and marketing groups and a million increase in travel costs in support of new market and customer opportunities 
we believe continued investments in our sales and marketing organizational infrastructure and related marketing programs are critical to the success of our strategy of expanding our customer base and enhancing relationships with our existing customers 
as a result  we expect sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in the future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefit costs for executive  finance  accounting  human resources  legal and information technology personnel 
non compensation components of general and administrative expenses include legal and other professional fees  facilities expenses and other corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal of million decreased million  or  from fiscal general and administrative expenses in fiscal included million related to legal settlements  which did not recur in fiscal in addition  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased by million for increases in compensation and related benefit costs 
during fiscal  general and administrative expenses of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily due to the accrual of the aforementioned legal settlements totaling million and increased legal costs aggregating million associated with the defense of legal proceedings 
in connection with the growth of our business  we expect general and administrative expenses will increase in the future 
non operating income a summary of the components of our interest and other income are as follows in millions interest income gain loss on sale of marketable securities write down of non marketable investments other interest and other income for fiscal of million is comprised principally of interest income of million related to our portfolio of marketable securities 
interest income increased by million due to increasing yields on our portfolio of marketable securities  as well as larger investment balances 
interest and other income for fiscal also includes realized losses on sales of marketable securities of million  compared to million of gains on sales of marketable securities in the prior year 

table of contents during fiscal  interest and other income of million is comprised principally of interest income related to our portfolio of marketable securities 
the million decline in interest and other income in fiscal from the prior year was due to a decline in investment income during fiscal  partially offset by the million of write downs of non marketable investments recorded in fiscal excluding the effect of the write downs of non marketable securities  interest and other income decreased by million during fiscal  primarily due to a million reduction of gains on sales of investments from the prior year 
in addition  interest income decreased by million due to declining yields on our portfolio of marketable securities  partially offset by increased earnings due to larger investment balances 
income taxes our effective tax rate approximated in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in the tax rate in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to the favorable resolution of routine tax examinations 
the increase in the tax rate in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to an increase in income before income taxes  without a corresponding increase in tax benefits associated with research activities and export sales 
we expect upward pressure on our effective tax rate in fiscal due to investments in foreign operations and the continued reduction in benefits derived from both extraterritorial income exclusion and research credits 
new accounting pronouncement in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting principles board opinion no 
and related interpretations  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
the provisions of sfas no 
r are similar to those of sfas no 
 however sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on their fair value on the date of grant 
fair value of share based awards will be determined using option pricing models eg black scholes or binomial models and assumptions that appropriately reflect the specific circumstances of the awards 
compensation cost will be recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of awards that actually vest 
we will be required to choose between the modified prospective and modified retrospective transition alternatives in adopting sfas no 
r 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost would be recognized in financial statements issued subsequent to the date of adoption for all shared based payments granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption  as well as for any unvested awards that were granted prior to the date of adoption 
as we previously adopted only the pro forma disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 we would  under this method  recognize compensation cost relating to the unvested portion of awards granted prior to the date of adoption using the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same attribution method used to determine the pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
under the modified retrospective transition method  compensation cost would be recognized in a manner consistent with the modified prospective transition method  however  prior period financial statements would also be restated by recognizing compensation cost as previously reported in the pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
the restatement provisions can be applied to either i all periods presented or ii to the beginning of the fiscal year in which sfas no 
r is adopted 
sfas no 
r is effective at the beginning of the first annual period beginning after june  for us  fiscal and early adoption is encouraged 
we will evaluate the use of certain option pricing models as well as the assumptions to be used in such models 
when such evaluation is complete  we will determine the transition method to use and the timing of adoption 
we do not currently anticipate that the impact on net income on a full year basis of the adoption of sfas no 
r will be significantly different from the historical pro forma impact as disclosed in accordance with sfas no 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our combined balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments have increased to million at april   compared to million at march  the increase during fiscal was attributable to cash generated from operations  offset by our million purchase of treasury stock and million of additions to property and equipment 
our working capital during fiscal increased million to million 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances  short term investments and cash flows from operating activities will provide sufficient funds to finance our operations for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need to supplement our existing sources of liquidity to finance our activities beyond the next months or for the future acquisition of businesses  products or technologies 
in addition  our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including changes in the markets we address  our revenues and the related manufacturing and operating costs  product development efforts and requirements for production capacity 
in order to fund any additional capital requirements  we may seek to obtain debt financing or issue additional shares of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing  if necessary  will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal and million for fiscal the increase in the cash provided by operating activities was due to the increase in net income and the timing of certain working capital items  including accounts receivable and inventory  and changes in certain non cash tax items compared to the prior year 
the operating cash flow for fiscal reflects our net income of million and million of non cash charges depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes and other and a net decrease in the non cash components of our working capital of million 
the decrease in the non cash components of working capital was primarily due to a million increase in income taxes payable  an increase of million in operating liabilities associated with the expansion of our business and a million decrease in accounts receivable  offset by an increase in inventories of million and an increase in other assets of million 
cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal includes net sales of marketable securities of million and additions to property and equipment of million 
during fiscal  cash used in investing activities of million includes net purchases of marketable securities of million and additions to property and equipment of million 
as our business grows  we expect capital expenditures to increase in the future as we continue to invest in machinery and equipment  more costly engineering and production tools for new technologies  and enhancements to our corporate information technology infrastructure 
cash used in financing activities of million for fiscal resulted from our purchase of million of treasury stock  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans 
during fiscal  the million of cash used in financing activities resulted from our purchase of million of treasury stock  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans 
in october  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock for a two year period 
we have repurchased the entire amount authorized pursuant to this program 
in june  our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional million of our outstanding common stock for a two year period 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million under these stock repurchase programs 
as of april   we have repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million under these stock repurchase programs 
the shares repurchased have been taken in as treasury shares and will be held as treasury shares until our board of directors designates that these shares be retired or used for some other purpose 
we repurchased the remaining amount authorized pursuant to the stock repurchase program  consisting of million shares for an aggregate purchase price of million  during the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents we have certain contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments in the form of non cancelable purchase orders to our suppliers and commitments under operating lease arrangements 
a summary of our contractual obligations and their impact on our cash flows in future fiscal years is as follows total in millions operating leases non cancelable purchase obligations total critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the accounting policies described below to be our most critical accounting policies 
these accounting policies are affected significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue and accounts receivable we sell our products domestically and internationally to oems and distributors 
our significant customers include leading storage solution providers  server oems and storage oems 
we recognize revenue from product sales when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii our price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order or a signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement with the customer 
the customer s obligation to pay and the payment terms are set at the time of shipment and are not dependent on the subsequent resale of our products 
however  certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements which contain a limited right to return unsold product and price protection provisions 
we recognize revenue from these distributors when the product is sold by the distributor to a third party 
at times  we provide standard incentive programs to our distributor customers and account for such programs in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
accordingly  we account for our competitive pricing incentives  which generally reflect front end price adjustments  as a reduction of revenue at the time of sale  and rebates as a reduction of revenue in the period the related revenue is recorded based on the specific program criteria 
royalty and service revenue is recognized when earned and receipt is assured 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this reserve is determined by analyzing specific customer accounts and applying historical loss rates to the aging of remaining accounts receivable balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to pay their accounts when due  additional reserves might be required 
we record provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated product returns and allowances such as competitive pricing programs and rebates in the same period that revenue is recognized 
these provisions are based on historical experience as well as specifically identified product returns and allowance 
table of contents programs 
additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
we write down the carrying value of our inventory to market value for estimated obsolete or excess inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we compare current inventory levels on a product basis to our current sales forecasts in order to assess our inventory balance 
our sales forecasts are based on economic conditions and trends both current and projected  anticipated customer demand and acceptance of our current products  expected future products and other assumptions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 

table of contents risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
our operating results may fluctuate  in future periods  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we have experienced  and expect to experience in future periods  fluctuations in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current gross margins or profitability in the future 
a significant portion of our net revenues in each fiscal quarter result from orders booked in that quarter 
orders placed by major customers are typically based on their forecasted sales and inventory levels for our products 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may be the result of the timing  size and mix of orders from customers  gain or loss of significant customers  customer policies pertaining to desired inventory levels of our products  negotiated rebates and extended payment terms  changes in our ability to anticipate in advance the mix of customer orders  levels of inventory our customers require us to maintain in our inventory hub locations  the time  availability and sale of new products  changes in the mix or average selling prices of our products  variations in manufacturing capacities  efficiencies and costs  the availability and cost of components  including silicon chips  warranty expenses  variations in product development costs  especially related to advanced technologies  variations in operating expenses  adjustments related to product returns  changes in effective income tax rates  including those resulting from changes in tax laws  actual events  circumstances  outcomes and amounts differing from judgments  assumptions and estimates used in determining the value of certain assets including the amounts of related valuation allowances  liabilities and other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements  changes in accounting rules  changes in our accounting policies  general economic and other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders and capital spending  or changes in the global economy that impact information technology spending 
our quarterly results of operations are also influenced by competitive factors  including the pricing and availability of our products and our competitors products 
although we do not maintain our own silicon chip manufacturing facility  portions of our expenses are fixed and difficult to reduce in a short period of time 
if net revenues do not meet our expectations  our fixed expenses could adversely affect our gross profit and net income until net revenues increase or until such fixed expenses are reduced to an appropriate level 
furthermore  announcements regarding new products and technologies could cause our customers to defer or cancel purchases of our products 
order deferrals by our customers  delays in our introduction of new products  and longer than anticipated design in cycles for our products have in the past adversely affected our 
table of contents quarterly results of operations 
due to these factors  as well as other unanticipated factors  it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  and as a result  the price of our common stock could significantly decrease 
we expect gross margin to vary over time  and our recent level of gross margin may not be sustainable 
our recent level of gross margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected by numerous factors  including changes in customer  geographic or product mix  introduction of new products  including products with price performance advantages  our ability to reduce production costs  entry into new markets  sales discounts  increases in material or labor costs  excess inventory and inventory holding charges  increased price competition  changes in distribution channels  increased warranty costs  and how well we execute our business strategy and operating plans 
our revenues may be affected by changes in it spending levels 
in the past  unfavorable or uncertain economic conditions and reduced global it spending rates have adversely affected the markets in which we operate 
we are unable to predict changes in general economic conditions and when global it spending rates will be affected 
furthermore  even if it spending rates increase  we cannot be certain that the market for san solutions will be positively impacted 
if there are future reductions in either domestic or international it spending rates  or if it spending rates do not increase  our revenues  operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 
our stock price may be volatile which could affect the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially  and there can be no assurance that such volatility will not continue 
several factors could impact our stock price including  but not limited to announcements concerning our competitors  our customers  or us  quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  differences between our actual operating results and the published expectations of analysts  introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by our competitors or us  conditions in the semiconductor industry  changes in market projections by industry forecasters  changes in estimates of our earnings by industry analysts  overall market conditions for high technology equities  rumors or dissemination of false information  and general economic and geopolitical conditions 

table of contents in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years and stock prices of technology companies have been especially volatile 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our business is dependent on the continued growth of the san market and if this market does not continue to develop and expand as we anticipate  our business will suffer 
a significant number of our products are used in sans and  therefore  our business is dependent on the san market 
accordingly  the widespread adoption of sans for use in organizations computing systems is critical to our future success 
sans are often implemented in connection with the deployment of new storage systems and servers 
therefore  our future success is also substantially dependent on the market for new storage systems and servers 
our success in generating revenue in the san market will depend on  among other things  our ability to educate potential oem customers  distributors  resellers  system integrators  storage service providers and end user organizations about the benefits of sans  maintain and enhance our relationships with oem customers  distributors  resellers  system integrators and storage system providers  predict and base our products on standards which ultimately become industry standards  and achieve interoperability between our products and other san components from diverse vendors 
our financial condition will be materially harmed if we do not maintain and gain market or industry acceptance of our products 
the markets in which we compete involve rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and continuing improvements in products and services 
our future success depends  in part  on our ability to enhance our current products and develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that keep pace with technological developments and industry standards  compete effectively on the basis of price and performance  and adequately address oem customer and end user customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
we believe that to remain competitive in the future  we will need to continue to develop new products  which will require a significant investment in new product development 
our competitors are developing alternative technologies  such as iscsi  sas  sata and infiniband tm that may compete with the market acceptance of our fibre channel products 
although we continue to explore and develop products based on new technologies  a substantial portion of our revenues is generated from fibre channel technology 
if alternative standards are adopted by the industry  we may not be able to develop products for new standards in a timely manner 
further  even if alternative technologies do augment fibre channel revenues  our products may not be fully developed in time to be accepted by our customers 
even if our new products are developed on time  we may not be able to manufacture them at competitive prices in sufficient volumes 
we depend on a limited number of customers  and any decrease in revenue or cash flows from any one of our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and cause our stock price to decline 
a small number of customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenues  and we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues in the foreseeable future 
our top ten customers accounted for and of net revenues for the fiscal and  respectively 
we are also subject to credit risk associated with the concentration of our accounts 
table of contents receivable 
the loss of any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  some of these customers are based in the pacific rim region  which is subject to economic and political uncertainties 
our customers generally order products through written purchase orders as opposed to long term supply contracts and  therefore  such customers are generally not obligated to purchase products from us for any extended period 
major customers also have significant leverage over us and may attempt to change the terms  including pricing and payment terms  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
this risk is increased due to the potential for some of these customers to merge with or acquire one or more of our other customers 
as our oem customers are pressured to reduce prices as a result of competitive factors  we may be required to contractually commit to price reductions for our products before we know how  or if  cost reductions can be obtained 
if we are unable to achieve such cost reductions  our gross margins could decline and such decline could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our business may be subject to seasonal fluctuations and uneven sales patterns in the future 
many of our oem customers experience seasonality and uneven sales patterns in their businesses 
for example  some of our customers close a disproportionate percentage of their sales transactions in the last month  weeks and days of each quarter  and some customers experience spikes in sales during the fourth calendar quarter of each year 
since a large percentage of our products are sold to oem customers who experience seasonal fluctuations and uneven sales patterns in their businesses  we could continue to experience similar seasonality and uneven sales patterns 
in addition  as our customers increasingly require us to maintain products at hub locations near their facilities  it becomes easier for our customers to order products with very short lead times  which makes it increasingly difficult for us to predict sales trends 
in addition  our quarterly fiscal periods often do not correspond with the fiscal quarters of our customers  and this may result in uneven sales patterns between quarters 
it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which the seasonality and uneven sales patterns of our oem customers may affect our business in the future because the historical growth of our business may have lessened the effect of this seasonality and uneven sales patterns on our business in the past 
competition within our product markets is intense and includes numerous established competitors 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and are characterized by short product life cycles  price erosion  rapidly changing technology  frequent product performance improvements and evolving industry standards 
in the fibre channel hba market  we compete primarily with emulex corporation 
in the iscsi hba market  we compete primarily with adaptec  inc in the switch products sector  we compete primarily with brocade communications systems  inc  cisco systems  inc 
and mcdata corporation 
we may compete with some of our larger disk drive and computer systems customers  some of which have the capability to develop integrated circuits for use in their own products 
we need to continue to develop products appropriate to our markets to remain competitive as our competitors continue to introduce products with improved performance characteristics 
while we continue to devote significant resources to research and development  these efforts may not be successful or competitive products may not be developed and introduced in a timely manner 
further  several of our competitors have greater resources devoted to securing semiconductor foundry capacity because of long term agreements regarding supply flow  equity or financing agreements or direct ownership of a foundry 
in addition  while relatively few competitors offer a full range of san products  additional domestic and foreign manufacturers may increase their presence in these markets 
we may not be able to compete successfully against these or other competitors 
if we are unable to design  develop or introduce competitive new products on a timely basis  our future operating results will be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents we expect the pricing of our products to continue to decline  which could reduce our revenues  gross margins and profitability 
we expect the average unit prices of our products on a product to product comparison basis to decline in the future as a result of competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by us or our competitors  or other factors 
if we are unable to offset these factors by increasing sales volumes  or reducing product manufacturing cost  our total revenues and gross margins may decline 
in addition  to maintain our gross margins we must maintain or increase current shipment volumes  develop and introduce new products and product enhancements  and we must continue to reduce the manufacturing cost of our products 
moreover  most of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of receipt of corresponding revenue 
as a result  we may not be able to decrease our spending to offset any unexpected shortfall in revenues 
if this occurs  our operating results and gross margins may be below our expectations and the expectations of investors and stock market analysts  and our stock price could be negatively affected 
our distributors may not adequately distribute our products and their reseller customers may purchase products from our competitors  which could negatively affect our operations 
our distributors generally offer a diverse array of products from several different manufacturers and suppliers 
accordingly  we are at risk that these distributors may give higher priority to selling products from other suppliers  thus reducing their efforts to sell our products 
a reduction in sales efforts by our current distributors could materially and adversely impact our business or operating results 
in addition  if we decrease our distributor incentive programs ie  competitive pricing and rebates  our distributors may temporarily decrease the amounts of product purchased from us 
this could result in a change of business habits  and distributors may decide to decrease the amount of product held and reduce their inventory levels  which could impact availability of our products to their customers 
as a result of the aforementioned factors regarding our distributors or other unrelated factors  the reseller customers of our distributors could decide to purchase products developed and manufactured by our competitors 
any loss of demand for our products by value added resellers and system integrators could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results 
we rely on the availability of third party licenses 
many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties 
it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products 
there can be no assurance that necessary licenses will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
the inability to obtain certain licenses or to obtain such licenses on favorable terms  or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for certain key components 
we purchase certain key components used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited sources 
we purchase application specific integrated circuits  or asics  from a single source  and we purchase microprocessors  certain connectors  logic chips  power supplies and programmable logic devices from limited sources 
we use forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our component requirements 
if we overestimate component requirements  we may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
if we underestimate component requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt the manufacturing process and result in lost or deferred revenue 
in addition  lead times for components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
we also may experience shortages of certain components from time to time  which could also delay the manufacturing processes 

table of contents we depend on our relationships with silicon chip suppliers and other subcontractors  and a loss of any of these relationships may lead to unpredictable consequences that may harm our results of operations if alternative supply sources are not available 
we currently rely on multiple foundries to manufacture our semiconductor products either in finished form or wafer form 
we generally conduct business with these foundries through written purchase orders as opposed to long term supply contracts 
therefore  these foundries are generally not obligated to supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
if a foundry terminates its relationship with us or if our supply from a foundry is otherwise interrupted  we may not have a sufficient amount of time to replace the supply of products manufactured by that foundry 
as a result  we may not be able to meet customer demands  which would harm our business 
historically  there have been periods when there has been a worldwide shortage of advanced process technology foundry capacity 
the manufacture of semiconductor devices is subject to a wide variety of factors  including the availability of raw materials  the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used and the performance of personnel and equipment 
we are continuously evaluating potential new sources of supply 
however  the qualification process and the production ramp up for additional foundries have in the past taken  and could in the future take  longer than anticipated 
new supply sources may not be able or willing to satisfy our silicon chip requirements on a timely basis or at acceptable quality or unit prices 
we have not developed alternate sources of supply for some of our products 
for example  our integrated single chip fibre channel controller is manufactured by lsi logic and integrates lsi logic s transceiver technology 
in the event that lsi logic is unable or unwilling to satisfy our requirements for this technology  our marketing efforts related to fibre channel products would be delayed and  as such  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the requirement that a customer perform additional product qualifications  or a customer s inability to obtain a sufficient supply of products from us  may cause that customer to satisfy its product requirements from our competitors 
constraints or delays in the supply of our products  due to capacity constraints  unexpected disruptions at foundries or with our subcontractors  delays in obtaining additional production at the existing foundries or in obtaining production from new foundries  shortages of raw materials or other reasons  could result in the loss of customers 
our products are complex and may contain undetected software or hardware errors that could lead to an increase in our costs  reduce our net revenues or damage our reputation 
our products are complex and may contain undetected software or hardware errors when first introduced or as newer versions are released 
we are also exposed to risks associated with latent defects in existing products 
from time to time  we have found errors in existing  new or enhanced products 
the occurrence of hardware or software errors could adversely affect the sales of our products  cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
the migration of our customers toward new products may result in fluctuations of our operating results 
as new or enhanced products are introduced  we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize the effects of product inventories that may become excess and obsolete  as well as ensure that sufficient supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demands 
our failure to manage the transition to newer products in the future or to develop and successfully introduce new products and product enhancements could adversely affect our business or financial results 
when we introduce new products and product enhancements  we face risks relating to product transitions  including risks relating to forecasting demand  as well as possible product and software defects 
if any of these factors were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
historically  the electronics industry has developed higher performance asics  which create chip level solutions that replace selected board level or box level solutions at a significantly lower average selling price 

table of contents we have previously offered asics to customers for certain applications that have effectively resulted in a lower priced solution when compared to an hba solution 
this transition to asics may also occur with respect to other current and future products 
the result of this transition may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in the future  a similar adverse effect to our business could occur if there were rapid shifts in customer purchases from our midrange server and storage solutions to products for the small and medium sized business market 
if our internal control over financial reporting do not comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  our business and stock price could be adversely affected 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate periodically the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls as of the end of each fiscal year 
the first management report on internal controls is contained in this report 
section also requires our independent public accountant to attest to  and report on  management s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting 
our management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors or frauds 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  involving us have been  or will be  detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes 
controls can also be circumvented by individual acts of a person  or by collusion among two or more people  or by management override of the controls 
the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies and procedures 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to errors or frauds may occur and not be detected 
although our management has determined  and our independent auditors have attested  that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of april   we cannot assure you that we or our independent auditor will not identify a material weakness in our internal controls in the future 
a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting would require management and our independent public accountant to evaluate our internal controls as ineffective 
if our internal control over financial reporting is not considered adequate  we may experience a loss of public confidence  which could have an adverse effect on our business and our stock price 
environmental compliance costs could adversely affect our net income 
many of our products are subject to various laws governing chemical substances in products  including those regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products 
we could incur substantial costs  or our products could be enjoined from entering certain countries  if our products become non compliant with environmental laws 
we also face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the materials composition of our products  including the restrictions on lead and certain other substances that will apply to specified electronic products put on the market in the european union as of july  restriction of hazardous substances directive and similar legislation currently proposed for china 
the european union has finalized the waste electrical and electronic equipment  or weee  directive which makes producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of past and future covered products 
these and similar laws adopted in other countries could impose a significant cost of doing business in those countries 

table of contents terrorist activities and resulting military actions could adversely affect our business 
terrorist attacks have disrupted commerce throughout the united states and europe 
the continued threat of terrorism within the united states  europe and the pacific rim  and the military action and heightened security measures in response to such threat  may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world 
to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  interruptions or delays in our receipt of products from our suppliers  delays in collecting cash  a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology  or our inability to effectively market  manufacture or ship our products  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are unable to predict whether the threat of terrorism or the responses thereto will result in any long term commercial disruptions or if such activities or responses will have any long term material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
because we depend on foreign customers and suppliers  we are subject to international economic  regulatory  political and other risks that could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
export revenues accounted for of our net revenues for fiscal we expect that export revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we are subject to several risks  which include a greater difficulty of administering and managing our business globally  compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulatory requirements  such as export requirements  tariffs and other barriers  differences in intellectual property protections  potentially longer accounts receivable cycles  currency fluctuations  export control restrictions  overlapping or differing tax structures  political and economic instability  and general trade restrictions 
a significant number of our customers and suppliers are located in pacific rim countries 
historically  the asian markets have suffered from economic uncertainty 
this uncertainty has taken place especially in countries that have had a collapse in both their currency and stock markets 
these economic pressures have reduced liquidity in the banking systems of the affected countries and  when coupled with excess industrial production capacity  could lead to widespread financial difficulty among the companies in this region 
our export sales are invoiced in us dollars and  accordingly  if the relative value of the us dollar in comparison to the currency of our foreign customers should increase  the resulting effective price increase of our products to such foreign customers could result in decreased sales 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may engage in mergers  acquisitions and strategic investments and these activities may adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 
our future growth may depend in part on our ability to identify and acquire complementary businesses  technologies or product lines that are compatible with ours 
mergers and acquisitions involve numerous risks  including uncertainties in identifying and pursuing target companies  difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks associated with entering markets or conducting operations with which we have no or limited direct prior experience  
table of contents the potential loss of current customers or failure to retain the acquired company s customers  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
further  we may never realize the perceived benefits of a business combination 
future acquisitions by us could dilute stockholders investment and cause us to incur debt  contingent liabilities and amortization impairment charges related to intangible assets  all of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
we have made  and could make in the future  investments in technology companies  including privately held companies in a development stage 
many of these private equity investments are inherently risky because the companies businesses may never develop  and we may incur losses related to these investments 
in addition  we may be required to write down the carrying value of these investments to reflect other than temporary declines in their value  which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with strategic alliances 
we have alliances with leading information technology companies and we plan to continue our strategy of developing key alliances in order to expand our reach into emerging markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our ongoing strategic alliances or that we will be able to find further suitable business relationships as we develop new products and strategies 
any failure to continue or expand such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that companies with which we have strategic alliances  some of which have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources than us  will not develop or market products in competition with us in the future  discontinue their alliances with us or form alliances with our competitors 
growth may strain our operations and require that we incur costs to upgrade our infrastructure 
we have experienced a period of growth and expansion 
our growth and expansion has placed  and continues to place  a strain on our resources 
unless we manage this growth and future growth effectively  we may encounter challenges in executing our business  such as sales forecasting  material planning and inventory management  which may result in unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results 
in addition  we test most of our products prior to shipment 
if our capacity to conduct this testing does not expand concurrently with the anticipated growth of our business  product shipments could be delayed  which could result in delayed or lost revenues and customer dissatisfaction 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
our future success largely depends on our key engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel  including highly skilled semiconductor design personnel and software developers 
if we lose the services of key personnel or fail to hire personnel for key positions  our business would be adversely affected 
we believe that the market for key personnel in the industries in which we compete is highly competitive 
in particular  periodically we have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified engineers and other technical personnel and anticipate that competition for such personnel will increase in the future 
we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel with the skills and expertise necessary to develop new products in the future or to manage our business  both in the united states and abroad 
decreased effectiveness of equity compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees  and changes in accounting for equity compensation could adversely affect earnings 
we have historically used stock options and other forms of equity related compensation as key components of our total rewards employee compensation program in order to align employees interests with the interests of our stockholders  encourage employee retention  and provide competitive compensation 
table of contents packages 
in recent periods  many of our employee stock options have had exercise prices in excess of our stock price  which reduces their value to employees and could affect our ability to retain or attract present and prospective employees 
in addition  the fasb has recently adopted changes to united states generally accepted accounting principles that require us and other companies to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives as of the beginning of the first annual period beginning after june  moreover  applicable stock exchange listing standards relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans could make it more difficult or expensive for us to grant options to employees in the future  which may result in changes in our equity compensation strategy 
these and other developments relating to the provision of equity compensation to employees could make it more difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees and result in additional expense to us 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies 
we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries 
this transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products and to redesign some products as well as standard cells and other integrated circuit designs that we may use in multiple products 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies 
currently  most of our products are manufactured in  and micron geometry processes 
in addition  we have begun to migrate some of our products to nanometer process technology 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes  which resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected and difficult to enforce 
although we have patent protection on certain aspects of our technology in some jurisdictions  we rely primarily on trade secrets  copyrights and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights  that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or that we can maintain such technology as trade secrets 
there also can be no assurance that any patents we possess will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states or at all 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  our business would be negatively impacted 
disputes relating to claimed infringement of intellectual property rights may adversely affect our business 
we have received notices of claimed infringement of intellectual property rights in the past  and have been involved in intellectual property litigation in the past 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert future claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us with respect to existing and future products 
although patent and intellectual property disputes may be settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and the necessary licenses or similar arrangements may not be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all 
as a result  we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling some of our products 
in addition  if we litigate these kinds of claims  the litigation could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention from other matters 
our business could suffer regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
our supply of silicon chips and other components can also be interrupted by intellectual property infringement claims against our suppliers 
changes in income tax laws or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our net income 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof  by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets 
table of contents and liabilities 
additionally  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
however  there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
computer viruses and other forms of tampering with our computer systems or servers may disrupt our operations and adversely affect net income 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan may discourage companies from acquiring us and offering our stockholders a premium for their stock 
pursuant to our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors is authorized to approve the issuance of shares of currently undesignated preferred stock without any vote or future action by the stockholders 
pursuant to this authority  in june  our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend of a right to purchase preferred stock for each outstanding share of our common stock 
after adjustment for stock splits  our common stock now carries one eighth of a preferred stock purchase right per share 
the stockholder rights plan may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our stock 
this may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of the common stock and may adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
our facilities and the facilities of third party manufacturers are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our california facilities  including our principal executive offices  our principal design facilities and our critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults 
we are not specifically insured for earthquakes  or other such natural disasters 
any personal injury or damage to the facilities as a result of such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  some of our products are currently manufactured at third party facilities that are located in malaysia 
any earthquake or other natural disaster  such as a tsunami  affecting a country in which our products are manufactured could significantly disrupt production of our products  and result in a significant delay in shipments of our products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain a marketable securities investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
in accordance with our investment guidelines  we only invest in instruments with high credit quality standards and we limit our credit exposure to any one issuer or type of investment 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments
