item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview tennant company is a world leader in designing  manufacturing and marketing products that help create a cleaner  safer world 
we provide equipment  parts and consumables and floor coatings to contract cleaners  end user businesses  healthcare facilities  schools and local  state and federal governments 
we sell our products through our direct sales and service organization and a network of authorized distributors worldwide 
geographically  our customers are primarily located in north america  europe and other international markets including the middle east  asia  japan  latin america and australia 
we strive to be an innovator in our industry through our commitment to understanding our customers needs and using our expertise to create innovative solutions 
our results were primarily influenced by three external factors the economic growth rates in the countries in which we sell our products  foreign currency exchange rates and prices of certain commodities that are used in the manufacture of our products 
each of these external factors and their impact on our results are described below 
the pace of economic growth in the countries in which we sell our products affects the growth of our sales volumes in each of our three geographic areas 
north america  which generates approximately two thirds of our consolidated net sales  experienced improvements in its economy during  which stimulated demand for our products and growth in sales volumes 
the growth in the local economies within our international markets other than europe generated increased demand for our products in these markets during despite the improvements in  the global economy remains unpredictable and we expect that economic recovery will be gradual and somewhat volatile 
the strength or weakness of the global economies in will impact demand for our products 
our results in continued to be favorably impacted by weakness of the us dollar against the euro  the australian and canadian dollars  the british pound and the japanese yen 
the direct financial impact of foreign currency exchange includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies to us dollars  the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between tennant operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses 
the direct financial impact of foreign currency exchange can be estimated and  where significant  is included in the discussion of our results of operations below 
in addition to the direct financial impact  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have an indirect financial impact which is very difficult to estimate 
the indirect financial impact on our results includes the effect on sales volumes within local economies and the impact of pricing actions taken as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
if the applicable exchange rates continue to strengthen relative to the us dollar  the related direct foreign currency effect would continue to have a favorable impact on our results in we are subject to exposures resulting from fluctuations in the price of certain commodities which influence the price of raw materials and product components as well as other operating costs 
we purchase raw steel and steel and petroleum based components for use in our manufacturing operations 
in addition  freight costs associated with shipping and receiving product and sales and service vehicle fuel costs are impacted by fluctuations in the cost of oil and gas 
during  purchased materials and other costs were impacted by the higher prices of these commodities which put downward pressure on margins as well as resulting in higher selling and administrative expense 
selling price surcharges on certain products in north america were implemented during  which partially mitigated the impact of the increased cost of steel and petroleum related materials on gross profit margins 
if the prices of these commodities continue to increase  our results could be unfavorably impacted in in addition to these external factors  our results were impacted by two significant management actions during the acquisition of walter broadley machines limited walter broadley in january and a workforce reduction action in september the acquisition of walter broadley  a cleaning equipment company based in the united kingdom  significantly increased our customer base and service coverage in the united kingdom 
the acquisition is discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
with annual sales of approximately million  the acquisition had a dilutive impact of approximately per diluted share through the first six months of  resulting from certain integration costs  and a short term impact on gross profit margins related to purchase accounting 
beginning with our third quarter of  operations of walter broadley were fully integrated into our european operations 
in september  management approved actions to reduce selling and administrative costs as a part of a continuing effort to improve profitability 
these actions included the elimination of a net management and administrative positions companywide and are expected to be substantially complete by the first quarter of these actions are expected to produce net annualized savings totalling million to million pretax in  increasing to million to million pretax in the workforce reductions resulted in the recognition of a net pretax charge of   after tax  or per diluted share in our results 
the charge consists primarily of severance and outplacement benefits and is included within selling and administrative s a expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings 
we use economic profit as a key indicator of financial performance and the primary metric for performance based incentives 
economic profit is based on our net operating profit after taxes less a charge for the net assets used in the business 
the key drivers of net operating profit we focus on include sales  gross margin  operating expenses and the effective tax rate 
the key drivers we focus on to measure how effectively we utilize net assets in the business include accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso  days inventory on hand dioh and capital expenditures 
these key drivers are discussed in greater depth throughout management s discussion and analysis 
historical results the following compares the historical results of operations for the years ended december   and in dollars and as a percentage of net sales dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net sales   cost of sales   gross profit   research and development expenses   selling and administrative expenses   restructuring charges  profit from operations   other income expense profit before income taxes   income tax expense    net earnings    earnings per diluted share consolidated financial results in  net earnings decreased to million or per diluted share 
net earnings were impacted by growth in net sales of to million partially due to the acquisition of walter broadley which contributed about to net sales and a positive direct foreign exchange impact of approximately 
the balance of the increase was related to growth in north american net sales driven by new product introductions  an improved economy and price increases  including surcharges on certain products  as well as volume growth in our other international markets 
a workforce reduction charge of million after tax million pretax  or per diluted share  related to actions to reduce selling and administrative costs as a part of a continuing effort to improve profitability 
the charge consists primarily of severance and outplacement benefits and is included within s a expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings 
other increases in s a expenses of million resulting primarily from an increase in performance based incentive compensation expense  an increase in marketing expenses to support product launches in the latter half of  sarbanes oxley compliance costs  increased expenses associated with our expanded market coverage in europe and the inclusion of expenses associated with the acquired operations of walter broadley 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in warranty expense primarily due to improved claims experience and a decrease in expense for specific warranty claims in  as well as benefits from prior restructuring actions 
direct foreign currency effects added approximately million to s a expenses for the year 
in  net earnings increased to million or per diluted share 
net earnings were impacted by growth in net sales of to million 
positive direct foreign currency exchange increased sales by approximately 
the remaining increase was due to sales growth in europe and other international markets 
recognition of previously deferred revenue totaling million as a result of the retroactive amendment to the agreement with our us third party lessor 
this increased net earnings by million or per diluted share 
the decision to dissolve our joint venture with an unrelated third party and discontinue manufacturing of the product that was the basis for the formation of the joint venture 
this resulted in a charge of million or diluted share 
a decrease in our effective tax rate to in from in primarily due to a more favorable mix of taxable earnings by country and a favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit 
net sales in  consolidated net sales of million increased from consolidated net sales of million in increased from million in in  the acquisition of walter broadley in january increased net sales approximately million  or for the year 
positive direct foreign currency exchange fluctuations  resulting primarily from a weakened us dollar compared to the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling and canadian and australian dollars  increased net sales by approximately in and approximately in the following table sets forth for the years indicated net sales by geography and the related percent change from the prior year dollars in thousands north america   europe    other international   total sales    north america in  north american net sales increased to million compared with million in growth in sales was driven by volume increases in equipment sales resulting from a stronger north american economy  new product introductions as well as price increases including surcharges on certain products to help offset the higher cost of steel and other materials 
growth in service  parts and consumables also contributed to the increase in north american net sales when compared to the same period last year 
in  north american net sales of million increased compared to the sales increase was primarily due to recognition of million of previously deferred revenue  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  sales growth in service  parts and consumables contributed to the increase 
offsetting these increases were declines in equipment sales due to continued weak economic conditions in the industrial sector in north america during europe european net sales in increased to million compared to the acquisition of walter broadley in january added about to europe s sales growth 
positive direct foreign currency exchange effects increased european net sales by approximately in the shipment of a large order to a new european customer  primarily in the first quarter of  contributed approximately to europe s sales growth 
european economies remained relatively weak in european net sales in were million  up compared to sales of million 
positive direct foreign currency exchange effects had a favorable impact on sales of approximately in compared to the remaining increase was primarily due to our expanded sales and service coverage in europe 
other international other international net sales for totaled million  up from positive direct foreign currency exchange effects increased sales in other international markets by approximately in the remaining increase resulted from stronger sales in several international markets including latin america  japan  asia and australia  primarily driven by stronger local economies in these markets as well as new product introductions 
other international net sales in were million  an increase of over sales of million 
positive direct foreign currency exchange effects increased sales by approximately in compared to the remaining increase in other international sales in compared with was primarily due to higher equipment sales due to strengthening economies and success selling new products in several foreign markets including asia  the middle east and australia 
gross profit gross profit margin in was compared to in gross profit margin in was unfavorably impacted by the increases in material costs including steel and petroleum based materials and purchased components 
selling price surcharges on certain products in north america were implemented in  which partially mitigated the impact of the increasing material costs on gross profit margins 
the net unfavorable impact was offset by favorable direct foreign currency exchange effects 
gross profit margin in remained consistent with gross profit margin in was unfavorably impacted by the write off of inventory related to the decision to dissolve a joint venture described in note to the consolidated financial statements along with unfavorable effects of sales mix  offset by favorable direct foreign currency exchange effects 
future gross profit margins could continue to be impacted by fluctuations in the prices of steel  oil and gas  competitive market conditions  the mix of products both within and among product lines and geographies  and foreign currency exchange effects 
operating expenses research and development expenses we strive to be the industry leader in innovation and are committed to investing in research and development 
this has led to the development and launch of products including readyspace carpet cleaning technology and the t series automatic scrubbers in  and fast and centurion in however  a focus on innovation also carries certain risks that new technology will be slow to be accepted by the marketplace 
management seeks to mitigate this risk through our focus on and commitment to understanding our customers needs and requirements 
research and development expenses increased million  or  in compared to  but declined as a percentage of sales in compared to research and development expenses increased million  or  in compared to  but declined as a percentage of sales in compared to we expect to maintain our spending on research and development at percent of net sales annually 
selling and administrative expenses s a expenses increased to million from million in s a expenses increased partly due to the pretax workforce reduction charge of million discussed previously and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the remaining increase in s a expenses primarily reflects an increase in performance based incentive compensation expense  an increase in marketing expenses to support product launches in the latter half of  sarbanes oxley compliance costs  increased expenses associated with our expanded market coverage in europe and the inclusion of expenses associated with the acquired operations of walter broadley 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in warranty expense primarily due to improved claims experience and a decrease in expense for specific warranty claims in  as well as benefits from prior restructuring actions 
approximately million of the increase in s a expenses is due to direct foreign currency exchange effects 
s a expenses as a percentage of sales were for  up from compared to this increase is primarily the result of the million severance charge as well as the additional marketing and sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
in addition  the percentage benefited from the million of deferred revenue that was recognized as a result of the amendment of the agreement with our third party lessor  for which there was no related s a expense 
s a expenses increased by million  or  in compared to the impact of positive direct foreign currency exchange contributed approximately of the increase 
the remaining increase is primarily related to an increase in performance based incentive compensation expense and to the dissolution of a joint venture as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
s a expenses as a percentage of sales declined compared with restructuring charges as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded pretax restructuring charges totaling million in related to a workforce reduction and consolidation of our north american distribution operations from a network of seven distribution centers into two new facilities that are leased and managed by a third party logistics services provider and actions to consolidate and centralize customer service operations in europe and to streamline other operations in north america 
the majority of these actions were completed during and these actions improved the efficiency and productivity of our north american organization and reduced global infrastructure 
in addition  a change in estimate of million was recorded in to reduce the and restructuring charges 
management regularly reviews our business operations with the objective of improving financial performance and maximizing our return on investment 
as a result of this ongoing process to improve financial performance  we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future which  if taken  could be material to our financial results 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was  and for the years  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the resolution of certain outstanding state and federal tax matters and a benefit resulting from the release of a valuation allowance on a foreign capital loss carryforward 
the effective rate was impacted by a favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit and a more favorable mix of the taxable earnings by country 
in the future  we may experience changes in our effective tax rate based on our ability to utilize the available foreign net operating loss carryforwards and changes in mix of taxable earnings by country 
during each of the past three years  we had a favorable impact from the extraterritorial income exclusion act eti act  a us tax law  of approximately on our effective tax rate 
on october   the american jobs creation act of was signed into law 
the new law included a provision to phase out the eti act tax benefit over the next two years 
in addition  the new law established a manufacturing deduction for profits on us manufactured product to be phased in over six years 
for  we expect the phase out of the eti act tax benefit to be substantially offset by the phase in of the us manufacturing deduction 
for to  we expect that the change in the us tax law will have a negative impact on our effective tax rate since the eti act is phased out more quickly than the phase in of the us manufacturing deduction 
the american jobs creation act of also had a provision to allow companies to repatriate earnings from their foreign subsidiaries at a favorable tax rate 
we do not plan to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries in the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources during  our financial condition remained strong 
our debt to total capital ratio was at december   compared with at december  at december   our capital structure was comprised of million of current debt  million of long term debt and million of shareholders equity 
as of december   we had available committed and uncommitted lines of credit totaling million  with terms generally one year or less  and a million letter of credit outstanding 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december   down from million as of december  approximately million of cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries 
wherever possible  cash management is centralized and intercompany financing is used to provide working capital to subsidiaries as needed 
our current ratio was at december   and at december   based on working capital of million and million  respectively 
if the global economy deteriorates  it could have an unfavorable impact on the demand for our products and  as a result  our operating cash flow 
we believe that the combination of internally generated funds  present capital resources and available financing sources are more than sufficient to meet cash requirements for our contractual cash obligations and commitments at december   are summarized in the following table in thousands total after on balance sheet obligations notes payable   capital leases  total on balance sheet obligations   off balance sheet arrangements operating leases     purchase obligations    total off balance sheet obligations    total contractual obligations    on balance sheet obligations our debt obligations totaling million as of december   as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  are primarily comprised of notes payable due in  capital lease obligations and collateralized borrowings 
cash obligations in the table above do not include obligations associated with our collateralized borrowings as these transactions represent deferred sales proceeds on certain leasing transactions in europe accounted for as borrowings under sfas no 
 accounting for leases sfas no 

we do not expect to have to fund these obligations 
in addition  we have other long term liabilities on the balance sheet which represent our obligations associated with long term employee benefit arrangements  primarily retirement benefit plans and unfunded deferred compensation arrangements 
our retirement benefit plans  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  require us to make contributions to the plans from time to time 
contributions to the various plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the market performance of plan assets  if any  and future changes in interest rates  which impact the actuarial measurement of plan obligations 
as a result  these obligations  which totaled million as of december   are not included in the table above 
we expect to contribute approximately million in total to our us retiree  us nonqualified  us pension and the german pension plans in we do not expect that a contribution will be required to our us pension plan for the foreseeable future 
the unfunded deferred compensation arrangements covering certain current and retired management employees totaled million as of december  we expect to distribute approximately million of this obligation in we cannot predict the timing or amounts of the remaining obligation as it is dependent upon a number of assumptions including termination dates and participant distribution elections 
our remaining long term employee benefit arrangements are comprised of long term incentive compensation arrangements with certain key management  foreign defined contribution plans and severance arrangements totaling million 
we cannot predict the timing or amount of our future payments associated with these arrangements  as a result  these obligations are not included in the contractual cash obligations and commitments table 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of operating lease commitments for office and warehouse facilities  vehicles and office equipment as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements as well as unconditional purchase commitments 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  these obligations are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
unconditional purchase obligations include purchase orders entered into in the ordinary course of business and contractual purchase commitments 
during  we entered into a purchase commitment with a third party manufacturer totaling million through september  with a remaining purchase commitment of approximately million as of december  we have a cancellation clause with our third party logistics provider which would require payment of a cancellation fee in the event we elect to cancel the agreement prior to the contract expiration date 
this fee  which approximated million at december   declines on a straight line basis over the life of the contract  which expires in in addition  in the event that we elect to cancel the agreement  we would be required to assume the underlying building lease for the remainder of its term 
we have applied the provisions of eitf  determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  and have determined that our agreement with our third party logistics provider contains an operating lease under sfas no 
as a result  we have included the future minimum lease payments related to the underlying building lease in our operating lease commitments in the contractual cash obligations and commitments table 
certain operating leases for vehicles contain residual value guarantee provisions  which would become due at the expiration of the operating lease agreement if the fair value of the leased vehicles is less than the guaranteed residual value 
of those leases that contain residual value guarantees  the aggregate residual value at lease expiration is million  of which we have guaranteed million 
as of december   we have not recorded a liability related to this residual value guarantee as we estimate our future settlements to be a net gain 
cash requirements operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in the cash provided by operating activities in was impacted by a decrease in inventory levels  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by an increase in receivables 
the decrease in inventories is primarily attributable to actions associated with inventory reduction initiatives 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased primarily due to the timing payments and higher accruals for performance based incentives  rebates and the workforce reduction charge 
the increase in receivables was a result of higher fourth quarter sales volumes 
in  cash provided from operating activities was impacted by a decrease in inventory levels due to companywide reduction initiatives following the buildup that occurred in as we were transitioning inventories to locations managed by our third party logistics provider and an increase in receivables due to higher sales volumes during the fourth quarter of as discussed previously  two metrics used by management to evaluate how effectively we utilize our net assets are accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso and days inventory on hand dioh  on a fifo basis 
these metrics for the years indicated were as follows in days dioh dso the improvement in dioh of days in reflects a continued focus on inventory reduction initiatives and the implementation of lean manufacturing principles  including a move closer to a true build to order approach for larger equipment  revisions to the order quantity formulas for parts and adjustments to purchased part lot sizes 
this follows an improvement in dioh of seven days in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in in january  we acquired all of the stock of walter broadley for million in the form of cash and debt as well as assuming million in outstanding debt  of which million was immediately retired 
the cost of the acquisition was paid for in cash with funds provided by operations 
capital expenditures were million during compared to million in the increase is primarily attributable to the installation of a new powder paint system and the purchase of additional system components to further expand the capabilities of our information systems 
capital expenditures in were lower than due to our transition to leasing versus purchasing fleet vehicles 
proceeds of million in included million from the sale of an office property in the uk in  capital spending is expected to be approximately to million 
significant capital projects planned for include continued expansion of the capabilities of our information systems and investments in new product tooling 
capital expenditures in are expected to be financed primarily with funds from operations 
financing activities net cash used by financing activities was million in  million in and million in during  million of assumed walter broadley debt was repaid  while financing activities included a million scheduled debt payment 
other financing activities in were comparable to activities 
cash dividends increased for the rd consecutive year to per share in  an increase of per share over during november  an additional  shares were authorized under the share repurchase program approved by the board of directors in may shares repurchased during  and approximated   and  respectively 
the average repurchase price was during  during and during at december   approximately  shares were authorized for repurchase 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments at the time of issuance 
sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
the effect of the standard will be to require entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock awards based on its grant date fair value and to recognize the cost over the period the employee is required to provide services for the award 
we plan to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r effective july   as required  and plan to use the modified prospective transition method for our existing stock based compensation plans 
under the modified prospective transition method  the fair value based accounting method will be used for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled after the adoption date 
compensation cost related to the nonvested portion of awards outstanding as of that date will be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated under the original provisions of sfas no 
under this method  we estimate that the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in approximately  to  of stock based compensation expense in the second half of related to non vested employee options issued prior to the adoption date 
beginning in  we modified our management compensation program and have replaced stock option awards with performance based share awards 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  compensation expense under this program will be recognized over the performance period  with adjustments to expense for changes in the market price of tennant stock and for actual achievement against established targets 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r in july  compensation expense associated with these performance based share awards will be fixed at the grant date fair value of the award and recognized over the remaining performance period based on actual achievement against established performance targets 
we estimate our full year expense associated with this program will be approximately million to million based on achievement of targeted performance 
in november  the fasb released revised sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 

the new standard requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the requirements of the standard will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  although we are still evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements  we do not believe it will have a material impact as we have not historically had any abnormally low levels of production  unplanned downtime  labor or material shortages 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record a reserve for accounts receivable that are potentially uncollectible 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
in order to assess the collectibility of these receivables  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
our reserves are also based on amounts determined by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  current economic trends  historical payment and bad debt write off experience 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers and if circumstances related to these customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if more allowances are provided than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on the actual collection experience 
bad debt write offs as a percentage of sales were in  in and in as of december   we had million reserved against our accounts receivable for doubtful accounts 
inventory reserves we value our inventory at the lower of the cost of inventory or fair market value through the establishment of a reserve for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory 
our reserve for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory is based on inventory levels  expected product lives and forecasted sales demand 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with inventory levels 
reserve requirements are developed according to our projected demand requirements based on historical demand  market conditions and technological and product life cycle changes 
it is possible that an increase in our reserve may be required in the future if there is a significant decline in demand for certain products 
this reserve creates a new cost basis for these products and is considered permanent 
we also record a reserve for inventory shrinkage 
our inventory shrinkage reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses that are recorded and adjusted as a part of our cycle counting and physical inventory procedures 
the reserve amount is based on historical loss trends  historical physical and cycle count adjustments as well as inventory levels 
changes in the reserve result from the completed cycle counts and physical inventories 
as of december   we had million reserved against inventories 
warranty reserves we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales  the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim  new product introductions and other factors 
future claims experience could be materially different from prior results because of the introduction of new  more complex products  a change in our warranty policy in response to industry trends  competition or other external forces  or manufacturing changes that could impact product quality 
in the event we determine that our current or future product repair and replacement costs exceed our estimates  an adjustment to these reserves would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
during  we recognized a change in estimate of million related to an increase in warranty claims on certain products 
during  our claims experience improved  resulting in a decrease in our warranty expense as a percent of sales and a decrease in expense for specific claims 
warranty expense as a percentage of sales was in  in and in as of december   we had million reserved for future estimated warranty costs 
deferred tax assets we recognize deferred tax assets for the expected future tax impact of temporary differences between book and taxable income 
deferred tax assets are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance and income tax charge are recorded when  in management s judgment  realization of a specific deferred tax asset is less likely than not 
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance could be materially different from actual results because of changes in the mix of future taxable income  the relationship between book and taxable income and our tax planning strategies 
the valuation allowance for foreign tax loss carryforwards at december   was million

it is not possible to anticipate or foresee all risk factors  and investors should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive or complete list of all risks or uncertainties 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to exposures resulting from foreign currency exchange fluctuations in the normal course of business 
our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar  the british pound and the japanese yen against the us dollar 
the direct financial impact of foreign currency exchange includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies to us dollars  the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between tennant operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses 
in addition to the direct financial impact  foreign currency exchange has an indirect financial impact on our results  including the effect on sales volumes within local economies and the impact of pricing actions taken as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
because our products are manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states  a stronger dollar generally has a negative impact on results from operations outside the united states while a weaker dollar generally has a positive effect 
our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize the earnings effects associated with foreign exchange rate changes on certain of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
we periodically enter into various contracts  principally forward exchange contracts  to protect the value of certain of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
the gains and losses on these contracts generally approximate changes in the value of the related assets and liabilities 
we had forward exchange contracts outstanding in the notional amounts of approximately million and million at the end of and  respectively 
the potential for material loss in fair value of foreign currency contracts outstanding and the related underlying exposures as of december   from a adverse change is unlikely due to the short term nature of our forward contracts 
our policy prohibits us from entering into transactions for speculative purposes 
commodity risk we are subject to exposures resulting from potential cost increases related to our purchase of raw materials or other product components 
we do not use derivative commodity instruments to manage our exposures to changes in commodity prices such as steel or oil and gas 
the recent increase in worldwide demand and other factors have caused prices for steel and related products to increase 
given the worldwide steel market conditions  we have experienced significant cost increases in our steel based raw materials and component parts in we purchase approximately million of raw and fabricated steel and steel based component parts annually 
we do not maintain an inventory of raw or fabricated steel in excess of near term production requirements 
we continue to focus on mitigating the impact of the anticipated steel cost increases through product pricing and negotiations with our vendors 
successful mitigation of the impact will depend upon our ability to increase our selling prices in a competitive market 
various factors beyond our control affect the price of oil and gas  including but not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and gas  political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions  the price and level of foreign imports  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  domestic and foreign governmental regulation and the overall economic environment 
we purchase petroleum related component parts for use in our manufacturing operations
