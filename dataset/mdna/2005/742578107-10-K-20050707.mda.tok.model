item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the matters discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition on form k should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare the consolidated financial statements of printronix in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available to us at the time 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities for the fiscal years presented 
we continuously evaluate our estimates  judgments and assumptions  including those related to product returns  customer programs and incentives  doubtful accounts  inventories  warranty obligations  intangible assets  other long lived assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the most critical accounting policies used to prepare the accompanying consolidated financial statements are the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with various authoritative guidance including  but not limited to  staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
the application of the authoritative guidance requires judgment to determine whether revenue has been realized or is realizable and earned 
we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when we have persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement in the form of a contract or a purchase order  the product has been delivered and title and risk of 
table of contents loss has passed  which generally occurs when the product is shipped  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our sales are based upon written contractual agreements with our resellers that include established pricing and payment terms 
our printers contain embedded software  which we consider incidental to the sale of the printer  and no revenue is attributed to the software 
we also sell standard pre packaged software to support bar code label printing applications and other software options 
this software does not require customization  nor do we have any post sale obligations 
revenue is recognized as this standard pre packaged software is shipped with the printer 
products that are not working properly may be returned subject to our warranty policy discussed below 
customers may return products that are incompatible with the intended application 
judgment is required to record provisions for future product returns 
our business model of configuring products to order for each customer and  in most cases  direct shipping to end users greatly reduces the amount of inventory in the channel  effectively reduces product return liability and aids in estimating future product returns 
we continuously monitor product returns 
each quarter  we evaluate the adequacy of our recorded accruals and record a provision as a revenue reduction for the estimated amount of future returns  based upon historical experience  authorization we have granted for significant pending returns and any other known factors 
although such returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we have established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
because of our direct ship business model  we encourage our channel partners not to hold inventory 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting returns  or product returns for other reasons  could have a material adverse impact upon our operating results for the period or periods in which such information is known 
we have few revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables such as the delivery or performance of multiple products  services or rights to use assets that would need to be identified into separate units of accounting 
occasionally  we sell and install print and apply thermal printers 
in instances in which we have determined installation to be inconsequential and perfunctory  revenue is recognized at the time of sale 
in all other instances  the printer revenue and applicable installation revenue are deferred until customer acceptance is obtained 
although not significant  judgment is also required to record provisions for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing  volume based incentives or other programs 
each quarter  we evaluate the adequacy of our recorded accruals and record a provision as a revenue reduction for the estimated amount for these programs 
historically  the revenue reductions for these programs have been within our range of estimates  however  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to stay within our range of estimates 
future market conditions may cause us to increase the amount of incentive programs or other programs and could result in additional revenue reductions at that time 
we offer professional services  such as training and development of customized applications for customers 
these services are generally short term in duration and are billed separately upon completion and acceptance of the service 
most of our customers arrange their own shipping methods 
for the remaining customers  we record revenue for shipping costs charged 
the related shipping costs incurred are recorded in cost of sales 
we offer printer maintenance services through service agreements that customers may purchase separately from the printer 
these agreements are mostly for a one year period 
we provide the point of customer contact and initial diagnostic services  and supply the parts used for printer repairs 
we have contracted with third parties to perform the on site repair services 
revenue from maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of each individual contract  which approximates the manner in which costs are incurred 
any significant change in estimates or circumstances could have a material adverse impact upon our operating results for the period or periods in which such information is known 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a variety of factors 
each quarter  we review all open accounts and provide specific reserves for customer collection issues when we believe the loss is probable  considering such factors as the length of time receivables are past due  the financial condition of the customer  and historical experience 
each quarter  we also record an unallocated reserve for all customers  excluding those that have been specifically reserved for  based upon evaluation of our historical losses  overall economic conditions in our industry and other factors 
receivable losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the account is uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the annual provision or benefit for doubtful accounts has ranged from million benefit to million provision over the past three fiscal years 
although bad debt losses historically have been within our expectations and the allowance we have established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same bad debt loss rates that we have in the past 
any significant change in estimates or circumstances could have a material adverse impact upon our operating results for the period or periods in which such information is known 
our accounts receivable include substantial receivables from a few large resellers  and a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these resellers  or other significant changes in estimates or circumstances with other customers  could result in an additional allowance that could have a material adverse effect upon our operating results and financial condition for the period or periods in which such information is known 
inventories inventories include the costs of material  labor and factory overhead 
each quarter  we record a provision to value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory using the first in  first out method fifo  or the current estimated market value of the inventory  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we periodically review historical sales activity to determine excess  slow moving items and potentially obsolete items and also evaluate the impact of any anticipated changes in future demand  such as the release or potential release of new or modified products  or new competitive products  and any other known factors at the time 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
estimated future demand could prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may experience product shortages  or may only be able to obtain the necessary components at a higher cost 
conversely  an inaccurate estimate of future demand may also result in additional charges for excess and obsolete inventories 
over the last two fiscal years  provisions for specific inventory reserves have been immaterial and have been charged to cost of sales 
inventory reserves in the aggregate have ranged from percent to percent of gross inventory  which we believe to be appropriate 
unanticipated changes in demand or changes in technology could have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated results of operations and our financial condition for the period or periods in which such information is known 
warranties we offer warranties of various lengths to our customers  depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
printronix generally offers either a day on site or a month return to factory standard parts and labor warranty on printer and verifier products to most customers 
defective printers and verifiers can be returned to us for repairs or replacement in the applicable warranty period at no cost to the customer 
supplies are warranted for the shelf life of the products  which can be up to two years 
we maintain an accrual for warranty obligations and provisions for estimated warranty obligations are charged to cost of sales 
each quarter  we determine the provision for warranty charges by applying the estimated repair cost and estimated return rates to the outstanding units under warranty 
our warranty provisions have ranged from million to million over the past two fiscal years  which has been approximately equal to our actual warranty costs 
we determine our estimated repair costs by reviewing our historical repair costs and factor in any known or anticipated changes in these costs 
we also evaluate our historical return rate and include the effects of any known or expected future changes in these rates 
we engage in product quality 
table of contents programs and processes  including evaluating our suppliers 
although our warranty costs historically have been within our expectations and the provisions we have established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
a significant increase in product failure rates  product return rates  or a significant increase in the cost to repair our products  could have a material adverse impact upon our operating results and financial condition in the period or periods in which such information is known 
long lived assets long lived assets are assessed in accordance with accounting guidance under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
judgment is required in the application of the authoritative guidance and in determining the recoverability of assets 
we assess the carrying value of long lived assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an underlying asset may not be recoverable 
in the event the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable  we would record an adjustment to the carrying value of the assets affected based upon a discounted cash flow method 
any major unanticipated change in circumstances could have a significant impact upon the recoverability of long lived assets and upon our operating results and financial condition 
income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
we estimate our income tax liability based upon current tax laws in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and those recognized for tax purposes 
in addition  our effective tax rate includes the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states 
repatriating eligible foreign earnings under the temporary provision of the american jobs creation act of as discussed below  would not be treated as an exception to our policy and intent of permanently investing such foreign earnings outside of the united states 
judgment is required to determine if deferred tax assets will be realized by examining both the positive and negative evidence available to us  such as historical taxable income or losses  and projected future taxable income or losses 
judgment is also required to determine the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
under sfas no 
 we must place greater reliance on our past history of domestic operating losses than on projected future domestic operating income in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary 
if the provision for income tax is inadequate  or if we are unable to realize deferred tax assets  or if the tax laws change unfavorably  we could experience income tax charges in excess of the reserves established 
likewise  if the provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  or if we are able to realize additional deferred tax assets  or if tax laws change favorably  we could experience reduced income tax charges or an actual tax benefit 
we have operations in multiple international taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues 
while we believe we have made adequate provision for any such issues  an unfavorable resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect upon our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
we have not completed the process of evaluating our position with respect to the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings taking into account the possible election of the repatriation provisions contained in the american jobs creation act of accordingly  as provided for in fasb staff position fsp fas no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  the company has not adjusted its income tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the possible effect of the new repatriation provision 
income tax expense  if any  related to the possible election of the repatriation provision will be recorded in the quarter when the company completes its evaluation and obtains the necessary management and board approvals for action  if any 

table of contents the company has not adjusted its deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the impact of the special deduction as discussed in fsp no 
fas  application on fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of the impact of this deduction  if any  will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on its us federal income tax return 
we believe it is probable that this deduction will not be available to printronix because of its existing domestic net operating losses 
contingencies we account for contingencies in accordance with various accounting guidance  including  but not limited to  sfas no 
accounting for contingencies and financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
judgment is required to evaluate the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to reasonably estimate the loss related to legal claims  tax related audits  guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  and other known issues  and we will record a charge to earnings if appropriate 
any significant change in estimates or circumstances could have a material adverse impact upon our operating results for the period or periods in which such information is known 
results of operations message from the president a message from the president regarding fiscal year and expectations for fiscal year can be found immediately preceding item of this annual report on form k 
overview of fiscal year compared with fiscal year revenue increased percent  partly due to line matrix growth of percent and partly due to continued growth in our thermal printer sales  which were up percent over the prior year 
we attribute this increase in thermal printer sales partly to rfid initiatives  which are generating increased revenue for both rfid and non rfid thermal products  as we gain exposure to leading cpg enterprises we had previously not sold to 
the increase in revenues is also partially due to stronger sales in the european and asian markets 
this increase is partly due to lower sales in emea in the prior year due to ibm s conversion to a direct ship method  partly due to a stronger euro  and partly due to geographic expansion by adding additional sales personnel and channels in selected countries 
during fiscal year  we believe we stopped the decline in our us sales to ibm with a sales growth program started in the prior fiscal year 
ibm is our biggest channel to market  and teaming with ibm is designed to grow both line matrix and thermal printer sales 
gross margins improved as a result of higher revenues  a stronger euro  continuing manufacturing cost reductions and productivity improvements 
operating expenses increased principally to support our strategic initiatives to grow revenue that include adding sales personnel in selected countries  marketing efforts related to launching rfid  and demand generation activities 
late in the fiscal year  we obtained a year extension of our favorable singapore pioneer tax status  retroactive to the beginning of fiscal year  resulting in a zero tax rate on singapore earnings 
income tax expense increased from the prior fiscal year as that year benefited from a large federal research and development credit 
cash and short term investment balances increased by million principally due to the results of operations  asset management programs  and stock option exercises 
overview of fiscal year compared with fiscal year revenue declined percent and was negatively impacted by continued economic uncertainty in the americas and european markets  the impact of competing technologies on line matrix product sales  and ibm s conversion to a direct ship method in emea 
ibm s conversion to a direct ship method in emea resulted in a slow down in orders as it worked down its existing inventory and was completed in the fourth fiscal quarter 
we continued to grow our thermal printer sales  which were up 
table of contents percent over the prior year 
gross margins improved as a result of a stronger euro  lower warranty expenses and lower provision for excess inventory 
we continued to invest a higher than industry average in research and development 
cost control programs reduced general and administrative expenses 
sales and marketing costs increased as we pursued revenue growth through our strategic initiatives that included adding sales personnel in selected countries around the world  demand generation by marketing to the installed base and focused attention on the rapidly emerging opportunities presented by rfid 
cash balances increased by million principally as a result of stock option exercises  asset management programs and results of operations 
expenditures of million were made to buy back company stock 
our focus during fiscal year was on several growth initiatives  including rfid 
as a result  we were first to market with an rfid printer and began shipments of our smart label developer s kit  in the third fiscal quarter of we also focused our efforts on geographical expansion by adding additional sales personnel in the emea and asia pacific regions  china in particular  and opened new sales offices in mexico and australia 
lower revenues and higher operating expenses  partially offset by a favorable impact from the euro  all contributed to reduced pre tax income 
revenue fiscal year compared with revenue summary revenue for the fiscal year was million  an increase of million  or percent  compared with the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenue in fiscal year was mainly attributable to unit sale increases as no major modifications were made to pricing 
revenue was up in emea and asia pacific and down slightly in the americas 
the increased sales in emea are the result of higher sales to ibm due to ibm s conversion to a direct ship method in the prior year  a strong euro  and increased sales to a major direct account 
sales grew in the asia pacific region from a rebounding economy  particularly in china 
sales of thermal products increased sharply in the america s but decreased line matrix sales resulted in lower overall revenues in the region 
sales of line matrix grew percent over the prior fiscal year  mainly in the asia pacific region 
our rfid initiatives allow us to gain access to leading cpg companies  which is generating increased revenue for both rfid and non rfid thermal products as we take market share 
thermal sales increased million  or percent 
rfid product sales were million in fiscal year  its first full year of implementation 
revenue by geographic region revenue by geographic region  related percent changes and percent of total revenue for fiscal years and were as follows year ended percent of total revenue march  march  percent march  march  change in thousands geographic region americas emea asia pacific americas oem sales decreased percent to million  principally as a result of lower sales to our largest customer  ibm 
although sales through ibm were down in early fiscal year  we believe our sales growth program has allowed us to stop the decline in sales in this channel to market 
americas distribution 
table of contents sales were flat at million for fiscal years and americas direct sales decreased percent to million for fiscal year emea oem sales increased million  or percent  to million  principally due to increased sales to ibm 
we expect emea sales through ibm to continue to increase as we deploy the ibm printronix sales teaming program  already in place in the us  in emea during the first quarter of fiscal year emea distribution sales were million  up from million a year ago 
emea direct sales were million  up from million a year ago 
changes in the value of the euro contributed million to emea revenue 
asia pacific sales increased million  or percent  to million  primarily as a result of the strong growth throughout the year in the distribution channel  mainly in china  where sales were up million 
revenue by product technology revenue by product technology  related percent changes and percent of total revenue for fiscal years and were as follows year ended percent of total revenue march  march  percent march  march  change in thousands product technology line matrix thermal laser verification products rfid the increase in line matrix printer sales was partly in emea  as a result of the prior year conversion by ibm to a direct ship method  and partly in asia pacific 
thermal printer sales growth reflects our growing market share of the high performance thermal market and our continued early successes in rfid printing primarily in the americas and emea 
we also added a new channel to market  scansource  inc  for thermal printers late in the fourth quarter of fiscal year laser sales are down primarily due to an emphasis on capitalizing on the opportunities presented by rfid 
we intend to refocus our efforts on laser sales in fiscal year recurring revenue recurring revenue from the installed base was million and percent of total sales for fiscal year  up from million and percent of total sales a year ago  we believe as a result of our demand generation programs 
recurring revenue includes line matrix ribbons  laser consumables  spares sales  sales under the advanced exchange program  labels  printer maintenance and depot repair services 
we will continue to focus on this strategic growth initiative by marketing to our installed base of customers and continuing to add channels to market 

table of contents revenue by channel revenue by channel  related percent changes and percent of total revenue for fiscal years and were as follows year ended percent of total revenue march  march  percent march  march  change in thousands channel oem distribution direct sales through the oem channel were flat at million in both fiscal years and as increases in emea in fiscal year were offset with declines elsewhere 
we expect growth in the oem channel in the next fiscal year as we have stopped the revenue declines in the americas with ibm  our largest oem reseller  in fiscal year through our sales growth programs and we intend to expand these programs into emea in fiscal year the growth in the distribution channel was due to strong performance in emea and asia pacific 
direct sales were up percent as we continued our direct marketing to major accounts 
revenue by customer revenue by customer  related percent changes and percent of total revenue for fiscal years and were as follows year ended percent of total revenue march  march  percent march  march  change in thousands customer largest customer ibm second largest customer top ten customers sales to ibm were higher in emea by million  or percent  as a result of the conversion to direct ship in the prior year 
sales to ibm in the americas decreased by million 
we believe our teaming with ibm has stopped the revenue declines we had noted earlier in the fiscal year 
international revenue revenue from united states customers was percent and percent of total revenue  while revenue from international customers was percent and percent of total revenue for fiscal years and  respectively 
we expect international revenue to grow and continue to be a large percentage of total revenue 
revenue fiscal year compared with revenue summary revenue for the fiscal year was million  a decrease of million  or percent  compared with the prior fiscal year 
we attributed the decrease partially to continued economic uncertainty in the americas and european markets which caused a slow down  or deferral  of customer capital expenditures directly impacting the company s sales in the regions  partially to the impact of competing technologies on line matrix printer sales and partially to a continued erosion in line matrix sales through oem channels 
in addition  ibm converted to a direct ship method in emea  resulting in a slow down in orders from ibm 
as they worked through this conversion  ibm continued to sell to its customers  however  they did not place 
table of contents replenishment orders with printronix in order to work down their existing inventory 
we estimate the lost revenue due to the conversion to be million 
this process was completed by the end of the fourth fiscal quarter 
the effects of changes in the value of the euro contributed million to revenue 
we increased sales of our thermal products by million  or percent  as we continued to take market share 
we attributed this increase to our direct marketing efforts 
rfid product sales  although small  gained momentum as the industry standards were being finalized 
the decrease in revenue in fiscal year was mainly attributable to unit sale decreases as no major modifications were made to pricing 
revenue by geographic region revenue by geographic region  related percent changes and percent of total revenue for fiscal years and were as follows year ended percent of total revenue march  march  percent march  march  change in thousands geographic region americas emea asia pacific americas oem sales decreased percent to million  principally as a result of lower sales to our largest customer  ibm

americas distribution sales decreased percent to million 
americas direct sales decreased percent to million 
emea oem sales decreased million  or percent  to million  as a result of ibm s transition to a direct ship method and a one time large sale of million in the prior year 
emea distribution sales were million  up from million a year ago 
emea direct sales were million  down from million a year ago 
changes in the value of the euro contributed million to emea revenue 
asia pacific sales increased from a year ago mostly as a result of growth in the distribution channel  mainly china  thailand and indonesia 
early in the prior fiscal year  sales in the asia pacific region had been negatively impacted by the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic which significantly slowed trade in the region

to stop any further erosion of line matrix product sold 
table of contents through the oem channel  printronix and ibm together have developed a plan for printronix to provide field sales support for ibm and its resellers as well as provide telemarketing to the ibm installed base for demand generation 
we believe the growth in thermal printer sales was a result of our direct marketing to major accounts which resulted in market share growth 
recurring revenue recurring revenue from the installed base was million and percent of total sales for fiscal year  up from million and percent of total sales for fiscal year  partly due to new demand generation programs

gross margin fiscal year compared with gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent in fiscal year compared with percent in fiscal year and increased due to the strengthening of the euro  higher sales volumes  and continuing manufacturing cost reductions and productivity improvements 
the changes in the value of the euro added million  or basis points  to the gross margin in fiscal year fiscal year compared with gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent in fiscal year compared with percent in fiscal year and increased due to the strengthening of the euro  lower warranty expenses  lower provision for excess inventory  and continuing cost reduction programs partially offset by lower volume 
the changes in the value of the euro added million  or basis points  to the gross margin in fiscal year warranty expenses decreased by million due to a decrease in the outstanding units under warranty 
charges for excess and obsolete inventory decreased by million due to asset management programs 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of engineering and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative costs 
operating expenses were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we believe it is critical to continue to invest in research and development to ensure technology leadership in line matrix  thermal and rfid printing solutions 
engineering expenses consist mostly of labor and test materials and in fiscal year included a million charge to write off tooling 
in fiscal year  we spent million on engineering and development  compared with million in fiscal year and million for fiscal year as a percentage of revenue  engineering and development expenses decreased in fiscal year to percent from percent in fiscal year  mostly as a result of higher revenue in fiscal year engineering and development expenses as a percentage of revenue were percent in fiscal year during fiscal year  we increased our focus on the development of rfid printing solutions in support of wal mart  the dod and other retailers initiatives 
printronix introduced its second generation of epc rfid smart label printers  this following the successful introduction of the industry s first epc rfid printer only nine months earlier 
this second generation printer platform included a new smart ready model  allowing customers to protect their investment in thermal printers by providing a field upgrade to rfid in the future 
this printer platform was further enhanced with new frequencies and protocols and launched in europe in the third fiscal quarter  marking the first introduction of a commercial uhf epc printer in europe 
building on the general purpose interface released in the prior fiscal year  printronix co developed and launched the industry s first epc rfid encode print apply system  which automatically applies encoded smart labels to cases and pallet with no manual intervention 
in fiscal year  the most significant change from prior years was a strategic shift to develop a new line of thermal printers to support wal mart and the dod s rfid initiatives 
in addition  the t thermal family was further enhanced to add additional data stream interpreters to work in tec  intermec and sato applications  and a general purpose interface was released to support a broad base of post processing external devices including print and apply applicators 
to address the market need for industrial grade transaction printing  a zero tear version of the p line matrix pedestal printer was developed and launched late in fiscal 
table of contents to facilitate regional expansion  the p line sold into asian markets received a new high speed controller coupled with regional specific enhancements for both distribution and oem version printers 
in fiscal year  expenditures were made to bring to market a wireless feature option for the thermal and line matrix printers and to enhance the line matrix product family 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal year increased to million  compared with million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses increased to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year and percent in fiscal year sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal year from the prior fiscal year due to higher costs for geographic expansion and increased spending for marketing 
marketing spending increased partially to launch rfid in emea and partially to support the geographic expansion 
in fiscal year  new sales offices were opened in australia  mexico  and china and additional sales resources were added in europe  resulting in additional sales compensation  facilities expenses and other related costs 
fiscal year sales and marketing expenses were also up over the prior year due to increased spending for marketing programs  including the creation of a telesales program to market to the installed base in the united states 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal year resulted from higher labor and marketing costs due to increased resources being applied to the major accounts and vertical marketing programs 
general and administrative spending for fiscal year was million compared with million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were percent  percent and percent in fiscal years  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased during fiscal year from the prior fiscal year due to increased consulting costs for sarbanes oxley compliance and legal and patent costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased during fiscal year from the prior fiscal year due to lower labor costs  lower provision for doubtful accounts resulting from resolution of an outstanding customer collection issue during the fourth quarter and lower amortization of intangibles  partially offset by increased consulting costs for sarbanes oxley compliance and the research and development tax credit study 
general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal year from the prior fiscal year due to lower labor costs  lower provision for doubtful accounts and lower amortization of intangibles 
the effects of changes in the value of the euro resulted in increases in operating expenses of million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
foreign currency losses gains  net foreign currency transactions and remeasurements were losses of thousand in fiscal year compared with losses of thousand in fiscal year and gains of thousand in fiscal year  principally due to the effect of changes in the value of the euro 
the future effect of changes in the value of the euro or other foreign currencies upon our consolidated results of operations or financial condition is difficult to predict 

table of contents interest and other income expense  net the components of interest and other income expense  net are as follows march  march  in thousands interest expense interest income other income expense interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  increased million in fiscal year due to an increase in interest income as a result of higher rates  higher cash and short term investment balances and a one time benefit related to resolving a federal income tax credit 
interest and other expenses  net  increased million in fiscal year due to a decrease in interest income as a result of lower rates  and lower other income 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal year  fiscal year and fiscal year was percent  percent and percent  respectively 
we expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year to be approximately percent 
the effective tax rate increased in fiscal year compared with mainly because the company was able to benefit a portion of the federal research and development credits against net operating loss carryforwards in fiscal year differences between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate for all fiscal years presented include the effects of increases in the valuation allowance  domestic operating losses  and pre tax earnings by subsidiaries that operate within lower tax jurisdictions for which no us taxes have been provided because the earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
in addition  fiscal year also included the federal research and development tax benefit 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company obtained a year extension of its favorable pioneer tax status in singapore  which had expired at the end of fiscal year this favorable pioneer tax status began in april and exempts income generated from the manufacture and sale of the printronix p series line matrix and t thermal products by its singapore subsidiary from tax liability 
this extension was retroactive to the beginning of fiscal year and expires at the end of fiscal year the extension is subject to certain capital spending investments and human capital investments 
as a result of obtaining this extension in the fourth quarter  the company reversed the million of income taxes that had been booked by its singapore subsidiary as of the end of the third fiscal quarter 
the pioneer status reduced foreign taxes by million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the diluted net income per share effect of this pioneer status was an increase of five cents  cents and cents for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we have not completed our evaluation of the effects of the american jobs creation act of and have not reached a conclusion that it is probable that foreign earnings will be repatriated 
therefore  as a result  we cannot conclude on what the associated tax effects may be and have not recorded any such tax effects in our fiscal year financial results 
we expect to complete our evaluation during fiscal year as of march   the company recorded net deferred tax assets of million 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset was supported by a tax strategy which management believes is prudent  feasible and which management would implement  if necessary  to realize the related tax benefits prior to the expiration of certain tax assets 
the identified tax strategy considers the sale  on a taxable basis  of certain intellectual property developed in the united states to a foreign subsidiary 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview the primary source of liquidity historically has been cash generated from operations  which was million  million  and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
cash generated from operations has been sufficient to allow the company to fund its working capital needs  invest in capital expenditures as needed  repurchase shares of its common stock during the fiscal periods presented and pay dividends starting in fiscal year credit facilities a subsidiary of the company maintains unsecured lines of credit with major foreign banks totaling million 
the company also maintains a commitment facility in the amount of million with a foreign bank to support its hedging activities 
the company has a letter of credit related to its workers compensation program for million  which renews automatically and is secured by cash 
during and as of the fiscal periods presented  no amounts were borrowed under these agreements

american jobs creation act of congress passed the american jobs creation act of on october  the act 
the act contains numerous changes to existing tax laws including  but not limited to  incentive to repatriate foreign accumulated earnings and other international tax provisions regarding foreign tax credits 
we have not completed our evaluation of the effects of this act and have not reached a conclusion that it is probable that foreign earnings will be repatriated 
therefore  we cannot conclude what the associated tax effects may be and have not recorded any such tax effects in our fiscal year financial results 
we expect to complete our evaluation during fiscal year fiscal year compared with cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased million to million in fiscal year we generated million in cash from operations  up from the million generated from operations a year ago  principally as a result of increased profitability  capital asset activity and receipt of a cash refund for federal research and development credits 
we purchased million in short term investments in the current fiscal year 
in fiscal year  cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were million  significantly lower than the prior fiscal year proceeds of million as large blocks of options were exercised shortly before expiring in the prior fiscal year 
investment in property  plant and equipment was less than depreciation expense 
payments totaling million were made on the long term note 
we ended fiscal year with debt of million related to the long term note  which consisted of million long term and million for the current portion of the long term debt 
the remaining shares that could be repurchased at the discretion of management under the stock buyback program totaled  shares as of march  we believe our internally generated funds are sufficient to finance anticipated working capital  capital expenditure requirements and cash dividend needs for the foreseeable future 
should we need to obtain additional sources of funds  we believe we could obtain such funds through additional credit facilities 
fiscal year compared with cash and cash equivalents increased million to million in fiscal year we generated million in cash from operations  which was lower than the million generated from operations in fiscal year principally as a result of decreased profitability and lower cash provided by inventory and other

no amounts were borrowed under these agreements for the fiscal periods presented and we expect this to continue 
guarantees in connection with the standby letter of credit agreement obtained for our workers compensation insurance program  we have agreed to indemnify the bank from any third party claims related to its performance on our behalf 
we believe the fair value of this indemnification agreement is minimal and have not recorded a liability for it 
in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products  the company may indemnify customers and hold them harmless against losses arising from intellectual property infringement claims 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is unlimited 
we have never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal and have not recorded a liability for these agreements 
new pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  inventory costs an amendment of arb  chapter sfas clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and will be adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal year the company is currently evaluating the financial statement impact of the implementation of sfas we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
congress passed the american jobs creation act of on october  the act 
the act contains numerous changes to existing tax laws including  but not limited to  incentive to repatriate foreign accumulated earnings and other international tax provisions regarding foreign tax credits 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp and fasb staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp 
both fsp and fsp are effective upon issuance 
fsp clarifies the application of sfas  accounting for income taxes sfas  to this new deduction for qualified production activities by stating the deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction under sfas  rather than as a tax rate deduction  and should be reported no earlier than the year in which it is reported on the tax return 
we believe it is probable that this deduction will not be available to printronix because of its existing domestic net operating losses 
fsp addresses the impact of the act s one time percent dividends received deduction for repatriated foreign earnings  provided they are reinvested in the permitted uses specified in the act 
fsp allows companies additional time to determine whether any foreign earnings will be repatriated under the act and evaluate how the law affects whether undistributed earnings continue to qualify for sfas s exception from recognizing deferred tax liabilities 

table of contents we have not completed our evaluation of the effects of this act and have not reached a conclusion that it is probable that foreign earnings will be repatriated 
therefore  we cannot conclude what the associated tax effects may be and have not recorded any such tax effects in our fiscal year financial results 
we expect to complete our evaluation during fiscal year in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options  be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value beginning with the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab regarding the sec staff s interpretation of sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
in april  the sec amended regulation s x to amend the date for compliance with sfas r beginning with the first interim or annual period of the registrant s first fiscal year beginning on or after june  printronix will be required to adopt sfas r and sab at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year  and is currently evaluating the requirements of sfas r  including the determination of the fair value method to measure compensation expense  the appropriate assumptions to include in the fair market value model and the transition method to use upon adoption 
the company believes the adoption of sfas r may have a material unfavorable impact on its consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
the guidance in apb is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in apb  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas amends apb to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of sfas are applicable for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the provisions of this statement  but does not expect it to have a material impact 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarifies that an entity must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
the types of asset retirement obligations that are covered by this interpretation are those for which an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity  however  the timing and or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the provisions of fin are effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december   although early adoption is encouraged 
the company is currently evaluating the provisions of this standard 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections which replaces accounting principles board opinions no 
accounting changes and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error  unless it is impracticable to do so 
when it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects of an accounting change  sfas requires application of the new accounting principle as of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable 
when it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of applying a change in accounting principle to all prior periods  sfas requires application as if the accounting principle were adopted prospectively from the earliest date practicable 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years

significant factors that may affect financial results and financial condition and information concerning forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are based upon management s current expectations concerning future activities or events and their potential impact upon the company 
past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to forecast results or trends in future periods 
we can offer no assurance that future activities or events affecting the company will be those anticipated by management 
in addition  any of the following risks and uncertainties could adversely affect our business  financial results or financial condition and cause the actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements in this document 
other risks and uncertainties also could affect our business 
although we reassess material trends and uncertainties affecting our consolidated results of operations and financial condition in connection with the preparation of our quarterly and annual reports  we do not intend to review or revise  in light of future events  any particular forward looking statement contained in this document 
the information contained below should be carefully considered when reviewing any forward looking statements contained in this document 
we operate in an industry influenced by worldwide capital spending 
our products are used for mission critical applications in industrial settings such as manufacturing plants and distribution centers and also in information technology and back office operations 
our revenue is impacted by the worldwide level of spending for capital expenditures related to manufacturing plant expansion or refurbishment 
in addition  our revenue is impacted by the level of activity in the worldwide supply chain processes 
we operate in an industry affected by competing technologies 
the industrial printing market utilizes varying technologies including line matrix  thermal transfer  laser  inkjet  serial and band printing technologies 
across all technologies  the printers are characterized as high  medium or low end depending upon their range of features  including functionality and durability 
products made by printronix utilize line matrix  high end thermal transfer and high end laser printing technologies 
prior to fiscal year  there were four years of declines in line matrix printer sales  partially due to the impact of other competing technologies  in particular mid range laser printers and thermal printers  and partially due to a loss of focus on selling our products by our largest customer in the oem channel  especially in the americas 
in fiscal year  we implemented programs to spur growth in line matrix sales and during fiscal year  we stopped the decline in us line matrix sales to our largest customer through our programs to provide field sales support and demand generation activities 
line matrix sales grew percent during fiscal year we cannot offer assurance that we will be able to continue to sustain increased levels of sales to our largest customer or prevent sales erosion in the future 

table of contents we have added additional sales resources in markets where line matrix applications are growing  such as the asia pacific region  specifically china and india  and eastern europe 
we continue to develop higher speed line matrix printers that will allow us to replace aging band printers and compete against the mid range laser printers 
we cannot offer assurance that we can successfully develop the needed products and compete against current competitors or future competitors for band printers and mid range laser printers 
even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a product  line matrix in particular  revenue could still decline as the market for the product matures 
we operate in an industry characterized by technological change and evolving industry standards 
the printing solutions industry is extremely competitive and is characterized by technological change  frequent new product developments  periodic product obsolescence  evolving industry standards  particularly for rfid  changing information technologies and evolving distribution channels 
we must adapt quickly to changing technological  application and solutions needs  and the introduction of new technologies and products offering improved features and functionality 
we could incur substantial cost to keep pace with the technological changes  and may not be able to adapt to these changes 
although we believe that we currently compete favorably with respect to these characteristics  this may change in the future 
our future success largely depends upon our ability to continuously develop new products with the quality levels customers demand  and develop new services and solutions 
we spend a greater amount on research and development than the industry average because we believe that providing innovative products and solutions is important to our future operations 
in spite of our efforts  we may fail to develop new products 
additionally  the new products we develop may not achieve market acceptance or may not be manufactured at competitive costs or in sufficient volumes 
if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure in a timely manner in response to competitive pressures  our consolidated results of operations could be affected 
we cannot guarantee the success of our research and development efforts 
any delay in the development  production or marketing of a new rfid product could result in our not being the first to market  which could harm our competitive position 
we must adapt quickly to changes mandated by the rfid industry standard setting group  epc global  and customers to maintain market share in this growing opportunity 
our failure to enhance our existing products  services and solutions or to develop and introduce new products  services and solutions that meet changing customer requirements and evolving technological standards would adversely impact our ability to sell our products 
we operate in a highly competitive market 
the market for medium and high speed computer printers  printer encoders and the related post sale supplies is highly competitive  subject to change  and is likely to become even more competitive 
we compete directly with several companies of various sizes  including some of the largest businesses in the united states and japan 
our competitors include privately held companies  publicly held companies and subsidiaries of multinational corporations 
some of our competitors may enter into strategic business relationships with other companies 
our current main competitor in line matrix printers is tally genicom 
our current main competitors in high end thermal printers are zebra technologies corporation zebra nasdaq zbra  toshiba tec corporation tec  sato  and intermec nyse una 
in the rfid market  our current main competitor is zebra 
we cannot offer assurance that we can successfully compete against these current competitors or future competitors 
some competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  sales  marketing and other resources than we do and have achieved greater name recognition for their products and technologies than we have 
we may not be able to successfully increase our market penetration or our overall share of the printer market 

table of contents increased competition may result in price reductions  increased sales incentive offerings  lower gross margins  loss of market share and could require increased investment in inventory  research and development  sales expenses  marketing programs and expenditures to expand channels to market 
our competitors may offer products with superior market acceptance  superior price or superior performance 
the company may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain current product cost reductions  or achieve future product cost reductions  including warranty costs 
customers may defer their purchasing decisions in anticipation of the introduction of new products or the actual introduction of new products by the company or its competitors 
if we fail to address our competitive challenges  there could be a material adverse effect upon our business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
we compete in the rapidly evolving market for rfid for the supply chain 
in fiscal year  printronix was first to market a smart label that met the needs of the rfid mandate from wal mart and the dod 
throughout fiscal year  printronix gained market leadership in the rfid uhf printer segment 
we believe printronix is well positioned to continue to be a leading participant in the growing rfid thermal printer market 
however  we cannot guarantee that we can successfully compete against competitors in the rfid market  nor can we provide assurances that we will be successful in maintaining our market leadership or improving our market share 
in the latter part of fiscal year  there was a slow down in sales activity within the rfid market  partly as a result of top tier vendors having complied with wal mart mandates 
this slow down also appears to be partly attributable to a cautious approach to deployment by users who are concerned with evolving new standards  intellectual property claims and individual country standards in global supply chains 
the industry expectation appears to be for a pick up in sales starting later this year and more active deployment in calendar while we believe the interest in rfid remains high  we can offer no assurance that the speed of rfid deployment will increase 
standards for the emerging rfid market continue to evolve 
the epc standards committee is currently driving the design of a second generation chip that is expected to become the standard going forward 
we cannot guarantee that we can successfully meet the evolving standards in the future or evolving product designs  or will continue to develop products to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by rapid technological change 
we have entered into several key strategic alliances with the leaders in rfid labels  software and integration services 
we cannot guarantee that these strategic alliances will be successful 
we rely on resellers to sell our products and services 
we use a variety of distribution channels  including oems and distributors  to get most of our products to market 
we may be adversely impacted by any conflicts that could arise between and among our sales channels 
we believe that our future success depends upon our ability to provide industrial strength printing solutions to a broader customer base and to maintain good relationships with our major oems and distributors 
we believe that continued purchase of our products by oems is dependent upon many factors  including oems desire to use outside suppliers rather than investing the capital resources necessary to develop their own products 

table of contents our dependence upon a small number of major resellers exposes us to numerous risks  including channel conflicts  loss of channel and the ability to bring our products to market  concentration of credit risk  including disruption in distribution should our resellers financial condition deteriorate  reduced visibility to end user demand and pricing issues which makes forecasting more difficult  resellers leveraging their buying power to change the terms of pricing  payment and product delivery schedules  and direct competition should a reseller decide to manufacture printers internally 
we cannot guarantee that resellers will not reduce  delay or eliminate purchases from us  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
we rely upon a few resellers for a significant amount of our revenue 
in fiscal years and  sales to our largest oem reseller  ibm  represented percent and percent of net sales  respectively  and sales to our second largest reseller represented percent and percent of net sales  respectively 
sales to the top ten customers represented percent of net sales in fiscal year and percent of net sales in fiscal year the loss of any one of these resellers would have a material adverse effect upon our business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
we operate in an environment of unpredictable demand 
we rely upon our ability to successfully manage our worldwide inventory supply chain and inventory levels to support uncertain demand in a cost effective manner 
our sales to resellers are made under purchase orders that typically have short delivery requirements 
although we receive periodic order forecasts from our major reseller  they have no obligation to purchase the forecasted amounts and may cancel orders  change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice 
significant increases in demand could result in inventory shortages  higher costs to obtain expedited materials and components  higher costs to expedite shipment to our customers  and or lost revenue opportunities 
significant decreases in demand could result in increased inventory levels  higher production costs  higher material and component procurement costs and reduced profitability 
we have taken several actions over the years to mitigate these risks 
we utilize just in time jit practices wherever possible in our manufacturing processes to minimize the potential for excess and obsolete inventories 
we maintain minimal levels of finished goods since we build to order 
we are able to achieve the many configurations customers require by combining the common elements of a printer with the unique combination of options selected by the customers to meet their needs for connectivity and features 
the use of this manufacturing process greatly reduces our needed inventory levels and offers maximum flexibility to meet customer demands 
we cannot guarantee that our consolidated results of operations and financial condition will not be adversely affected in the future by possible changes in demand 
our quarterly sales patterns have historically reflected a slightly higher than normal level of sales in the last few weeks of each quarter  making forecasting more difficult 
in addition  seasonality in sales also affects our business to some degree 
typically sales are low in the emea region during the summer months as the region generally takes extended holidays 
sales are also typically higher in our third fiscal quarter  which ends in december  as many of our customers are on a calendar year 
we cannot guarantee that these trends will continue 
we have international customers  suppliers and operations 
for fiscal years   and  international revenue excluding united states sales accounted for approximately percent  percent  and percent  respectively  of our net sales 
we expect that 
table of contents international revenue will continue to grow and account for a significant percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
our products are sold in eighty countries around the world that subjects us to risks that may be unique to a particular country  but also to risk factors that may affect the global economy 
our products are manufactured using raw materials and components that are acquired from sources around the world 
we use a large number of suppliers and regularly evaluate the availability of potential alternate suppliers should circumstances change with existing suppliers 
we rely on a single or limited number of sources for certain raw materials and components  although we attempt to have alternate sources where possible 
we internally develop most of the software used in our printer products 
certain software is purchased from suppliers through royalty agreements 
if we were to experience a sudden loss of availability of purchased raw materials and components or purchased software  we are unable to guarantee that we could quickly obtain the needed items from alternate sources 
our ability to ship our products in desired quantities and in a timely  cost effective manner could be adversely affected  thus affecting our business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
we rely heavily upon our international facilities to maintain appropriate inventory levels  manufacture products  and complete configuration of printers in a timely and cost efficient manner 
should we fail to successfully predict demand  we may not have sufficient inventory levels available to address customer requirements  or may need to use costly distribution methods  such as air freighting  to meet sales requirements 
there are many risks associated with international customers  suppliers and operations  including  but not limited to  the following compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulations  including export requirements  tariffs  import duties  health and safety requirements and other barriers  fluctuations in freight and duty costs and disruptions at important geographic points of exit and entry  differences in intellectual property protection  differences in technology standards or customer requirements  the possibility of defective parts from suppliers  difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax efficient manner and changes in tax laws  currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency movements  economic instability  including inflation  recession and interest rate fluctuations  longer accounts receivable cycles and financial instability  local labor regulations  trade protection measures and regulations  risk of loss of our international assets due to political or economic instability  political or civil turmoil  war or conflict abroad or in the united states  difficulties associated with environmental regulations under various federal  state  and international laws  including restrictions imposed in the european union  the restriction of hazardous substance directive rohs and european union waste electrical and electronic equipment directive weee which makes producers of electrical goods  including computers and printers  responsible for collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of recovered products  and other similar legislation  including similar legislation currently proposed for china  
table of contents natural disasters  such as earthquakes  floods  tsunamis and typhoons  consequences resulting from our armed military conflict in iraq  terrorist attacks or other armed hostilities abroad or in the united states and outbreaks of infectious disease such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or other public health issues 
we are substantially self insured for losses and business interruptions stemming from terrorist attacks  armed conflicts  war  power shortages and natural disasters 
california and other parts of the united states have experienced major power shortages and blackouts and could experience them in the future  which could disrupt our business or that of our suppliers or customers 
our corporate headquarters and research and development activities are located in california  near known earthquake faults 
it is impossible to predict the ultimate impact on us  but our business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake 
we could incur substantial costs  including clean up costs  fines  sanctions  property damage claims and personal injury claims  if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non compliant with environmental laws 
the company operates in many countries with differing and sometimes conflicting income tax requirements 
the company s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by overlapping or differing tax laws  changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing income tax rates and unfavorable outcomes of future audits by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions 
in particular  the realization of deferred tax assets  which are predominately in the unites states  depends on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states 
further  our effective tax rate may be impacted if we elect to repatriate cash held outside the united states under the terms outlined in the american jobs creation act of failure to manage the risks posed by our international customers  suppliers and operations could have a material adverse effect upon our business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and future changes in equity compensation accounting could adversely affect earnings 
the ability to attract and to retain key  highly qualified personnel  both technical and managerial  is critical to our success 
developing  manufacturing and marketing our products is a complex process and requires significant expertise to meet customers specifications 
competition for personnel  particularly qualified engineers and employees with expertise in rfid applications  is keen 
the loss of a significant number of key personnel  as well as the failure to recruit and train additional key personnel in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect upon our business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in the future  the company will be required to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants 
as a result  we may incur increased compensation costs and may need to change our equity compensation structure  and find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  all of which could impact our business 

table of contents intellectual property is important to our success 
we rely upon patents to protect our intellectual property 
we execute confidentiality and non disclosure agreements as needed and limit access to  and distribution of  our proprietary information  however  we cannot guarantee that our efforts to protect our intellectual property will be successful 
our ability to compete successfully and to achieve future revenue growth depends  in part  upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology and to operate without infringing upon the rights of others 
we may fail to do so 
such infringement claims  whether or not valid  could result in substantial costs  diversion of management s attention and resources from our ongoing business 
claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign products  enter into costly settlement or licensing agreements or pay costly damage awards 
even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs  the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual agreement to us 
a third party may assert that we  or customers indemnified by us  violate their intellectual property 
a third party claiming infringement also may obtain an injunction or other equitable relief  which effectively could block the distribution or sale of allegedly infringing products 
the departure of any of our key management and technical personnel  or breach of non disclosure obligations  or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives may have a material adverse effect upon our business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
our stock price is volatile 
our stock price has fluctuated and we expect that it will continue to do so 
many factors can influence our stock price  including but not limited to the announcement of new products or innovations by us or our competitors  changes in the levels of quarterly revenue or net income  and speculation in the press or investment community about the company  in particular as it relates to rfid 
investors should not rely on recent trends to predict future stock prices  consolidated financial condition  or results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our foreign operations may be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
we are not aware of any significant risks with respect to our foreign business other than those inherent in the competitive nature of the business and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we employ a foreign currency hedging program in order to mitigate exposure to foreign currency rate movements 
information on our foreign currency hedging program is found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
foreign currency transaction and remeasurement losses from all foreign currencies were thousand and thousand for fiscal years and  respectively  and gains of thousand for fiscal year  principally due to the effect of changes in the value of the euro 
the effects of changes in the euro s value in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  were as follows an increase in revenue of million  an increase in gross margin of million and an increase in operating expenses of million and foreign exchange gains of million 

table of contents the effects of changes in the euro s value in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  were as follows an increase in revenue of million  an increase in gross margin of million and an increase in operating expenses of million and foreign exchange losses of million 
the future effect of changes in the value of the euro or other foreign currencies on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition is difficult to predict 
interest rate risk we have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally debt obligations and short term cash investments 
borrowings are at variable rates for periods that generally do not exceed days 
information about our bank borrowings is found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
information about the fair value of the financial instruments is found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
if interest rates were to increase by percent basis points on the long term note  the impact on our pre tax earnings would not be material
