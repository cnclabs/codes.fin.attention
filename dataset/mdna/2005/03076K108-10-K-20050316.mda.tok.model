critical accounting policies abc has established certain accounting and financial reporting policies to govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from the judgments and estimates adopted by management which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of abc s operations 
we believe the following accounting policies applied by abc represent critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses we believe the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
calculation of the allowance for loan losses represents a critical accounting estimate due to the significant judgment  assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses  consideration of current and historical trends and the amount and timing of cash flows related to impaired loans 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the subsidiary banks allowances for loan losses 
such agencies may require the subsidiary banks to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
considering current information and events regarding a borrower s ability to repay its obligations  management considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectibility of all amounts due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  is in doubt 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral is used to determine the amount of impairment 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for losses on loans 
subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
cash receipts for accruing loans are applied to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
cash receipts on impaired loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied first to principal and then to interest income 

table of contents the accounting for impaired loans described above applies to all loans  except for large pools of smaller balance  homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment  loans that are measured at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value and debt securities 
the allowance for loan losses for large pools of smaller balance  homogeneous loans is established through consideration of such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  adequacy of the underlying collateral  loan concentrations  historical charge off trends and economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay 
certain economic and interest rate factors could have a material impact on the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
the national economy showed signs of rebounding during the third and fourth quarters of if the economy s momentum continues  certain factors could evolve which would positively impact our net interest margin 
an increase in interest rates by the federal reserve would favorably impact our net interest margin 
an improving economy could result in the expansion of businesses and creation of jobs which would positively affect abc s loan growth and improve our gross revenue stream 
conversely  certain factors could result from an expanding economy which could increase our credit costs and adversely impact our net earnings 
a significant rapid rise in interest rates could create higher borrowing costs and shrinking corporate profits which could have a material impact on borrowers ability to pay 
we will continue to concentrate on maintaining a high quality loan portfolio through strict administration of our loan policy 

another factor that we have considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses is loan concentrations to individual borrowers or industries 
at december   we had individual credit relationships that exceeded million with none exceeding million 
a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is in the commercial real estate and residential real estate sectors 
those loans are secured by real estate in abc s primary market area 
a substantial of portion of other real estate owned is located in those same markets 
therefore  the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of our loan portfolio and the recovery of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of other real estate owned are susceptible to changes to market conditions in abc s primary market area 
we are closely monitoring certain portions of our loan portfolio that we believe have a higher credit risk profile under the current environment based solely upon their industry classification which includes agricultural and agribusiness loans 
based on current information  we have not identified any problem credits included in these categories  which are not already classified as nonperforming or impaired loans 
however  if the economic recovery takes longer than expected  the allowance for loan losses could be impacted by adverse developments in these credits 
income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and the provision for loan losses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or adjust this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provisions in the statement of income 
we have recorded on our consolidated balance sheet net deferred tax assets of  which includes amounts relating to loss carryforwards 
we believe there will be sufficient taxable income in the future to allow us to utilize these loss carryforwards in the tax jurisdictions where they exist 
long lived assets  including intangibles we evaluate long lived assets  such as property and equipment  specifically identifiable intangibles and goodwill  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets might not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment loss recognized would be determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the fair value was less than the book value 
in determining the existence of impairment factors  our assessment is based on market conditions  operational performance and legal factors of abc and the banks 
our review of factors present and the resulting appropriate carrying value of our goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets are subject to judgments and estimates that management is required to make 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets might be impaired 
performance overview we reported net income of million  or per diluted common share  in  compared to million  or per diluted common share  in and million  or per diluted common share  in the return on average assets was in compared to in and 
in the return on average common stockholders equity was in compared to in and in in accordance with accounting rules promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb  no amount of goodwill was expensed in  or  except for the impairment charge of  in during  we continued to focus on three goals pursued in preserving asset quality  minimizing shrinkage of our net interest margin and controlling noninterest expenses 
as a result of our focus on asset quality  nonperforming assets decreased during and during  our charge off ratio was basis points lower in compared to and basis points lower in compared to the previous year  and the ratio of our allowance for loan losses to nonperforming assets increased during compared to during due to the improvement of asset quality  we reduced our provision for loan losses million to million in compared to a reduction of million to million in 
table of contents due to a continuing low interest rate environment during  our net interest income actually increased million  or  to million in compared to million in due to the fact that abc was able to reduce its cost of funds by million while maintaining its interest income at virtually the same level in both and as in  we avoided paying excessive interest rates on non core deposits and relied on lower cost alternative funding 
this strategy did not result in a shrinkage of average deposits in average interest bearing deposits remained at the same level in and while average noninterest bearing deposits increased million in compared with approximately 
million of this increase was attributable to the acquisition of citizens bank wakulla in november we continued our goal of controlling noninterest expenses 
in pursuit of this goal  we held our increase in noninterest expense to in over the amount for salaries and employee benefits were held to an increase of excluding amounts allocated to loan costs in over all other noninterest expenses increased by only in over results of operations general our principal asset is the ownership of our banks 
accordingly  our results of operations are primarily dependent upon the results of operations of our banks 
our banks conduct a commercial banking business which consists of attracting deposits from the general public and applying those funds to the origination of commercial  consumer and real estate loans including commercial loans collateralized by real estate 
the banks profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated from interest earning assets ie  loans and investments less the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities ie  customer deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate paid and earned on these balances 
net interest income is dependent upon the banks interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on its interest earning assets and the average rate paid on its interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate interest income 
the interest rate spread is impacted by interest rates  deposit flows and loan demand 
additionally  and to a lesser extent  the profitability of the banks is affected by such factors as the level of noninterest income and expenses  the provision for loan losses and the effective tax rate 
noninterest income consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts and other fees and income from the sale of investment securities and origination of mortgage loans 
noninterest expenses consist of compensation and benefits  occupancy related expenses and other operating expenses 
earnings summary we reported earnings of million for representing an increase of million  or  compared to earnings of million for diluted earnings per common share were in compared to in and in as required by fasb  we discontinued the amortization of goodwill in we periodically test goodwill to determine whether the carrying value of our goodwill is impaired

we seek to meet liquidity requirements primarily through management of short term investments principally interest bearing deposits in banks and monthly amortizing loans 
another source of liquidity is the repayment of maturing single payment loans 
in addition  our banks maintain relationships with correspondent banks which could provide funds to them on short notice  if needed

generally  these commitments to extend credit have been granted on a temporary basis for seasonal or inventory requirements and have been approved by the banks board of directors 
our banks have also granted commitments to approved customers for standby letters of credit 
these commitments are recorded in the financial statements when funds are disbursed or the financial instruments become payable 
the banks use the same credit policies for these off balance sheet commitments as they do for financial instruments that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee

unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation

table of contents rate and volume analysis the following table reflects the changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates and from asset and liability volume 
federally tax exempt interest is presented on a taxable equivalent basis assuming a federal tax rate 
the change in interest attributable to rate has been determined by applying the change in rate between years to average balances outstanding in the later year

this strategy is overseen in part through the direction of our asset and liability committee the alco committee which establishes policies and monitors results to control interest rate sensitivity 
as part of our interest rate risk management policy  the alco committee examines the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and monitors its interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within the time period analyzed  usually one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within such time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if our assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal 

table of contents a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates 
accordingly  the alco committee also evaluates how the repayment of particular assets and liabilities is impacted by changes in interest rates 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may not react identically to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features generally referred to as interest rate caps which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the following table sets forth the distribution of the repricing of our earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   the interest rate sensitivity gap ie  interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitivity liabilities  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie  interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitive liabilities and the cumulative sensitivity gap ratio 
the table also sets forth the time periods in which earning assets and liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
however  the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the net interest margin since the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive pressures and the needs of our customers 
in addition  various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times within such period and at different rates 
at december  maturing or repricing within zero to three months three months to one year one to five years over five years total dollars in thousands earning assets interest bearing deposits in banks federal funds sold restricted stock investment securities loans interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits savings certificates less than  certificates   and over other short term borrowings other borrowings trust preferred securities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap interest rate sensitivity gap ratio cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio we have found that now and money market checking deposits and savings deposits reprice between three months and one year or between one to five years depending on the competition in the market areas where the deposits are located 
therefore  we have placed portions of these deposits in the three months to one year horizon and the one to five years horizon based on estimated amounts repricing in each horizon 

table of contents investment portfolio we manage the mix of asset and liability maturities in an effort to control the effects of changes in the general level of interest rates on net interest income 
see asset liability management 
except for its effect on the general level of interest rates  inflation does not have a material impact on the portfolio due to the rate variability and short term maturities of its earning assets 
in particular  approximately of the loan portfolio is comprised of loans which mature or reprice within one year or less 
mortgage loans  primarily with five to fifteen year maturities  are also made on a variable rate basis with rates being adjusted every one to five years

interest on loans that are classified as nonaccrual is recognized when received 
past due loans are loans whose principal or interest is past due days or more 
in some cases  where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties  loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the original contractual terms 
december  dollars in thousands loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis installment loans and term loans contractually past due ninety days or more as to interest or principal payments and still accruing loans  the terms of which have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower loans now current about which there are serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms in the opinion of management  any loans classified by regulatory authorities as doubtful  substandard or special mention that have not been disclosed above do not i represent or result from trends or uncertainties which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity or capital resources  or ii represent material credits about which management is aware of any information which causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
any loans classified by regulatory authorities as loss have been charged off 
summary of loan loss experience the allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for potential losses in the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans  with a particular emphasis on nonaccruing  past due and other loans that management believes require attention 
we segregate our loan portfolio by type of loan and utilize this segregation in evaluating exposure to risks within the portfolio 
in addition  based on internal reviews and external reviews performed by independent auditors and regulatory authorities  we further segregates our loan portfolio by loan classifications within each type of loan based on an assessment of risk for a particular loan or group of loans 
certain reviewed loans require specific allowances 
allowances are provided for other types and classifications of loans based on anticipated loss rates 
allowances are also provided for loans that are reviewed by management and considered creditworthy and loans for which management determines no review is required 
in establishing allowances  management considers historical loan loss experience with an emphasis on current loan quality trends  current economic conditions and other factors in the markets where the subsidiary banks operate 
factors considered include among others  unemployment rates  effect of weather on agriculture and significant local economic events  such as major plant closings 

table of contents we have developed a methodology for determining the adequacy of the loan loss reserve which is followed by all our banks and monitored by abc s senior credit officer and internal audit staff 
procedures provide for the assignment of a risk rating for every loan included in our total loan portfolio  with the exception of credit card receivables and overdraft protection loans which are treated as pools for risk rating purposes 
the risk rating schedule provides seven ratings of which three ratings are classified as pass ratings and four ratings are classified as criticized ratings 
each risk rating is assigned a percent factor to be applied to the loan balance to determine the adequate amount of reserve 
many of the larger loans require an annual review by an independent loan officer 
as a result of loan reviews certain loans may be assigned specific reserve allocations 
other loans that surface as problem loans may also be assigned specific reserves 
past due loans are assigned risk ratings based on the number of days past due 
the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings in the current period to replenish the allowance and maintain it at a level management has determined to be adequate 
the provision for loan losses charged to earnings amounted to million in  million in and million in the decrease in the provision for loan losses in and resulted from a decrease in net charge offs in and as compared to and an overall improvement in the quality of the loan portfolio during both years 
our allowance for loan losses was million at december   representing of year end total loans outstanding  compared to million at december   representing of year end total loans outstanding 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover potential loan losses 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses the following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated 
management believes the allowance can be allocated only on an approximate basis 
the allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any other category

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed only to u 
s 
dollar interest rate changes and  accordingly  we manage exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
we do not have any trading instruments nor do we classify any portion of the investment portfolio as held for trading 
we do not engage in any hedging activities or enter into any derivative instruments with a higher degree of risk than mortgage backed securities  which are commonly  pass through securities 
finally  we have no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and other market risks 
interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of a financial institution 
the sensitivity to rate changes is known as interest rate risk 
the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
as part of our asset liability management program  the timing of repriced assets and liabilities is referred to as gap management 
our policy is to maintain a gap ratio in the one year time horizon of 
to 
as indicated by the gap analysis included in this annual report  we are somewhat asset sensitive in relation to changes in market interest rates 
being asset sensitive would result in net interest income increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a declining rate environment 
see asset liability management 

table of contents we use simulation analysis to monitor changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates 
the simulation of rising  declining and flat interest rate scenarios allow management to monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity to minimize the impact of market interest rate swings 
the analysis of the impact on net interest income over a twelve month period is subjected to a gradual basis points increase or basis points decrease in market rates on net interest income and is monitored on a quarterly basis 
our most recent simulation model projects net interest income would increase if rates rise basis points gradually over the next year 
on the other hand  the model projects net interest income to decrease if rates decline basis points over the next year
