item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected financial data  and our financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth below under factors that may affect results and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a therapeutic drug development company principally focused on the discovery  development and future commercialization of products that modulate key regulatory signaling pathways controlling the repair and regeneration of human tissues and organs 
our product development approach involves using small molecules  proteins or antibodies to modulate these regulatory signaling pathways  for example  to increase the pathway signals when they are insufficient or to decrease them when they are excessive 
we have successfully used our product development approach to produce multiple compounds with potential use for several different disease indications 
for example  we have developed a clinical stage product candidate for the topical treatment of basal cell carcinoma and several promising preclinical product candidates in the fields of cancer  kidney disease  neurological disorders  cardiovascular disease and hair growth regulation 
we operate in a single reportable segment developmental biology products 
we expect that any successful products would be used in the health care industry and would be regulated in the united states by the us food and drug administration 
since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through license fees  research and development funding from our strategic collaborators  the private and public placement of our equity securities  debt financings and the monetization of certain royalty rights 
we have never been profitable and have incurred an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we expect to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as we devote substantially all of our resources to research and development of our product candidates 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability and do not expect to achieve profitability in the foreseeable future  if at all 
we currently have strategic collaborations with genentech and wyeth pharmaceuticals  or wyeth  to develop therapeutics which modulate the signaling of the hedgehog pathway 
we have also licensed our bmp pathway portfolio to ortho biotech products  for systemic administration for all non orthopedic and dental therapeutic applications 
our strategic collaborations and license agreements generally provide for our research  development and commercialization programs to be either majority or wholly funded by our collaborators and provide us with the opportunity to receive additional payments if specified milestones are achieved  as well as royalty payments upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon the collaboration 
these strategic license and collaboration agreements included  in up front payments  including  received from the sale of shares of our common stock  and potential future clinical development milestones of approximately  in the aggregate  assuming that all of the collaborations continue for their full terms and all milestone payments are received upon successful completion of specified research and development objectives 
these collaborations also include royalty rates on potential future product sales ranging from to 
in the future  we plan to continue to seek corporate collaborators for the further development and commercialization of some of our technologies 
in some cases  we have retained development and commercialization rights in areas where we believe we can attain the greatest potential long term value through the application of our own internal resources 
pursuant to the terms of our collaboration agreement with genentech  on january  we elected to exercise a co development option with genentech pursuant to which we will now share equally in us development costs and any future net profits and or losses derived from sales in the us of a therapeutic product 
table of contents candidate for the topical treatment of basal cell carcinoma 
we expect that by exercising this co development and equal cost sharing option we will incur approximately  in development expenses through the phase ii clinical trials  a portion of which will be recorded in the first quarter of we plan to assist genentech in filing an investigational new drug application with the fda in order to initiate human clinical investigation of the basal cell carcinoma product candidate 
assuming the acceptance of the investigational new drug application by the fda and the successful advancement of the basal cell carcinoma product candidate through phase i and phase ii clinical trials  we expect that the phase ii clinical trial will be completed in mid we expect to incur additional costs to complete phase iii clinical trials and complete the regulatory approval process  assuming that we and genentech successfully complete phase ii clinical trials 
financial operations overview general 
our future operating results will depend largely on the magnitude of payments from our current and potential future corporate collaborators and the progress of other product candidates currently in our research and development pipeline 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on  among other factors  the timing of our entry into new collaborations  the timing of the receipt of payments from collaborators and the cost and outcome of clinical trials 
we believe that our existing capital resources at december  should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into mid  including expected spending related to our co development of our lead product candidate for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma  under development with genentech 
our ability to continue funding our planned operations beyond mid is dependent upon the success of our collaborations  our ability to maintain or reduce our cash burn rate and our ability to raise additional funds through equity  debt or other sources of financing 
a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that could affect our liquidity  capital requirements and ability to raise additional funds is set forth below under the heading risk factors that may affect results 
revenue 
we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for several years  if ever 
substantially all of our revenue to date has been derived from license fees  research and development payments  and other amounts that we have received from our strategic collaborators and licensees  including genentech  ortho biotech products  wyeth and stryker 
in the future  we will seek to generate revenue from a combination of license fees  research and development funding and milestone payments in connection with strategic licenses and collaborations  and royalties resulting from the sale of products which incorporate our intellectual property and from sales of any products we successfully develop and commercialize  either alone or in partnership with third parties 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of payments received under our strategic collaborations  and the amount and timing of payments we receive upon the sale of our products  to the extent that any are successfully commercialized 
research and development 
research and development expense consists of costs incurred to discover  research and develop product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  outside service costs including medicinal chemistry  consulting and sponsored research collaborations  and occupancy and depreciation charges 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
the following table summarizes our primary research and development programs  including the current development status of each program 
in the table below  the term early preclinical means we are seeking to obtain initial demonstrations of therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of human disease  mid preclinical means we are seeking to obtain multiple demonstrations of efficacy in preclinical models of human disease  and late preclinical means we are seeking to obtain both multiple demonstrations of efficacy in preclinical models of human disease and relevant toxicology and safety data required for an investigation new drug application filing with the fda  referred to as an ind in the table below  seeking to commence a phase i clinical trial to assess safety in humans 
except for the public disclosures of genentech  all of our estimates below regarding planned filing dates for investigational new drug applications for our product development programs are solely our judgments 
these estimates may not reflect the plans of our corporate collaborators or licensors  if applicable 
moreover  because 
table of contents of the early stage of development of these programs  our  and our collaborators and licensors ability to successfully complete preclinical studies of these product candidates  and the timing of completion of such programs  is highly uncertain 
accordingly  the estimated period in which we or our collaborators or licensors may file an investigational new drug application for any of these product candidates may vary materially from the estimates set forth below product candidate primary indication collaborator licensee status estimated period of ind filing hh topical small molecule antagonist basal cell carcinoma genentech late preclinical first quarter hh systemic small molecule or antibody antagonist cancer genentech mid preclinical early bmp protein kidney disease ortho biotech products late preclinical late early hh small molecule agonist nervous system disorders wyeth mid preclinical hh small molecule agonist hair growth internal development late preclinical hh agonist protein gene cardiovascular disease internal development  mid preclinical to be determined discovery research spinal muscular atrophy spinal muscular atrophy foundation discovery to be determined discovery research various signaling pathways internal development discovery to be determined this product candidate has been licensed to ortho biotech products 
under the license arrangement  we expect to incur no future costs related to these programs  assuming the license agreement remains in effect 
all development decisions are at the sole discretion of ortho biotech products 
our hh small molecule agonists were licensed to wyeth under our collaboration agreement  effective february under the terms of our collaboration agreement with wyeth  our retained rights to use hh small molecule agonists in our hair loss and cardiovascular disease programs are subject to the requirement that wyeth must first determine that such compounds are less suitable for systemic use in the wyeth neurological disorders program and thus available for further development in our hair loss and cardiovascular disease programs 
in december  wyeth made several compounds available to us for our further development in the hair growth program 
we have incurred nominal expenses related to our cardiovascular disease program for the year ended december  our preclinical data relating to this program has been derived from studies conducted at caritas st 
elizabeth s medical center in boston  massachusetts 
we have entered into agreements under which additional third party collaborators are attempting to replicate this preclinical data 
we expect to incur costs on our cardiovascular disease program during the first half of related to this work 
we cannot estimate the period to in which we will make an investigational new drug filing for this program since we have not yet replicated the preclinical data and any investigational new drug filing will be dependent on the successful replication of these data 
in addition  should we be successful in our efforts to license this program in  any investigational new drug filing will ultimately be the responsibility of a strategic collaborator 
wyeth has a right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive license to the cardiovascular applications 
if wyeth declines to exercise its option  or if we are unable to reach an agreement with wyeth on terms within the contractually specified period  we free to seek another collaborator for this program 
the programs included within this section are not well enough defined for us to generate estimates regarding the timing of filing an investigational new drug application 
there is a risk that any drug discovery and development program may not produce products or revenue 
due to uncertainties inherent in drug discovery and development  including those factors described below under risk factors that may affect results  we and our collaborators may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize any of the product candidates included in the table above 
all of our product development initiatives are in various stages of preclinical testing 
because of the early stage of these programs  the successful development of our preclinical product candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from any of our product candidates due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of the timing of when collaborators may make compounds  that are subject to our retained rights  available for our development  either alone  or as part of a co development program  the scope  quality of data  rate of progress and cost of clinical trials and other research and development activities undertaken by us or our collaborators  future clinical trials results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  
table of contents the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
any failure to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and some consequences of failing to do so  are set forth below in risk factors that may affect results 
we have received a development plan and budget from genentech relating to the clinical development of a small molecule formulated for topical treatment for basal cell carcinoma 
based on this budget  we expect that by exercising this co development and equal cost sharing option we will incur approximately  in development expenses through phase ii clinical trials  a portion of which will be recorded in the first quarter of assuming the acceptance of the investigational new drug application by the fda and the successful advancement of the basal cell carcinoma product candidate through phase i and phase ii clinical trials  we expect that the phase ii clinical trial will be completed in mid we expect to incur additional costs to complete phase iii clinical trials and complete the regulatory approval process  assuming that we and genentech successfully complete phase ii clinical trials 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  legal  information technology  corporate communications and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  insurance  and professional fees for legal  patent and accounting services 
strategic collaborations and license agreements 
since inception  substantially all of our revenue has been derived from collaborations and other research and development arrangements with third parties 
our current strategic collaborations and key license agreements are with genentech  ortho biotech products and wyeth 
pursuant to these strategic license and collaboration agreements we have received  in up front payments  including  received from the sale of shares of our common stock  and may receive potential future clinical development milestones of approximately  in the aggregate  assuming that all of the collaborations continue for their full terms and all milestone payments are received upon successful completion of specified research and development objectives 
these collaborations also include royalty rates on potential future product sales ranging from to 
the collaborations and licenses are summarized as follows genentech collaboration 
in june  we licensed our proprietary hedgehog pathway antagonists to genentech for human therapeutic use 
the primary focus of our collaborative research plan has been to develop these molecules for cancer indications 
the collaboration consists of two main programs the development of a small molecule formulated for topical treatment of basal cell carcinoma  and the development of systemically administered small molecule and antibody hedgehog antagonists for the treatment of certain other solid tumor cancers 
the development of the topical hedgehog antagonist is subject to a co development arrangement with genentech 
pursuant to the collaborative research  development and license agreement entered into in june  as amended in december  genentech paid us an up front payment of  purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of 
table of contents per share for aggregate proceeds of  and made a maintenance payment of  during the initial two year term of the research program  genentech has also agreed to make research and development funding payments totaling  of which  has been paid to date 
in march  genentech added one of our small molecule antagonists of the hedgehog signaling pathway covered under our collaboration to its product candidate pipeline 
this small molecule is under development for the topical treatment of basal cell carcinoma 
under the terms of our collaboration with genentech  we retained the right to co develop products in the field of basal cell carcinoma in the us on january   we elected to exercise this co development option and will now share equally in both the us development costs and any future us net profits and or losses of our basal cell carcinoma product candidate 
this co development right includes basal cell carcinoma and any additional indications for which this product candidate may be developed in the us genentech has stated that it expects to file an investigational new drug application with the fda in the first quarter of pending fda approval of this investigational new drug filing  genentech will begin enrollment of a phase i clinical trial for a basal cell carcinoma product candidate 
we currently estimate that our share of development costs for the basal cell carcinoma indication will approximate  through the phase ii clinical trials 
we expect that this endpoint will be achieved  if at all  in mid in addition  in certain major international markets  we will receive milestones if specific clinical development objectives are achieved and a royalty on any international sales of the topical hedgehog antagonist 
under the systemic hedgehog antagonist portion of the collaboration  genentech is also obligated to make cash payments to us upon the successful achievement of clinical development and drug approval milestones 
in addition  genentech will pay a royalty on potential future net product sales  which increases with increasing sales volume 
as a result of our licensing agreements with various universities  we are obligated to make payments to these university licensors when certain payments are received from genentech 
these obligations total  for the  up front license fee and the  maintenance fee for the period june  through june  as of december    has been paid to the university licensors 
the unpaid obligations are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  ortho biotech products license 
in november  we licensed our broad bmp technology portfolio to ortho biotech products on an exclusive  worldwide royalty bearing basis  for all non orthopedic and non dental therapeutic applications in exchange for a  fee  a series of cash milestones if specified clinical research objectives and regulatory approvals are achieved  including a  milestone payment upon us regulatory approval of a product for the treatment of kidney disease  and a royalty on potential future product sales 
ortho biotech products has assumed all future costs and responsibility for bmp based product development and has sole responsibility for deciding if and when human clinical trials of bmp based product candidates will begin 
wyeth collaboration 
effective february  we licensed our hedgehog proteins and small molecule hedgehog pathway agonists to wyeth on an exclusive worldwide  royalty bearing basis for the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products for therapeutic applications in the treatment of diseases and disorders in humans with the primary focus of the research program on the treatment of neurological disorders  including neurodegenerative diseases and neuropathies 
under the terms of the agreement  wyeth paid us a license fee of  and purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of  wyeth will also provide us with research funding for a minimum of two years 
in addition  wyeth is obligated to make cash payments to us upon the successful achievement of development and drug approval milestones and is obligated to pay a royalty on net product sales  if any  that escalates with increasing sales volume 
as part of our collaboration with wyeth  we have retained development and licensing options for certain therapeutic applications of the hedgehog agonist technologies  including those applications that qualify as orphan drug indications  topical applications for hair growth and local delivery applications for 
table of contents treatment of cardiovascular disease 
wyeth has a right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive license to the cardiovascular applications 
if wyeth declines to exercise its option  or if we are unable to reach an agreement with wyeth on terms within the contractually specified period  we are free to seek another collaborator for this program 
we are obligated to make payments to various university licensors when certain payments are received from wyeth 
we have paid to such university licensors a total of  upon receipt of the  up front license fee from wyeth 
in addition  as part of a termination agreement entered into with elan  we will pay elan royalty payments related to any revenues  other than revenues received as direct reimbursement for research  development and other expenses  that we receive in the field of neurological disease 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosure of certain assets and liabilities at our balance sheet date 
such estimates and judgments include the carrying value of property and equipment and intangible assets  revenue recognition and the value of certain liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in our consolidated financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements long lived assets 
long lived assets consist of goodwill  long term receivables  equity securities held in micromet  es cell international and aegera therapeutics  capitalized patent costs and long term deposits 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in addition  we perform a goodwill impairment test annually 
if it were determined that the carrying value of intangible or long lived assets might not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we would measure any impairment based on a projected cash flow method 
goodwill 
at december   we have recorded  in goodwill 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 effective january   we ceased amortization of goodwill and have since performed at least annual assessments of goodwill impairment by comparing our fair value to our net assets 
sfas no 
requires us to perform an impairment assessment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our goodwill may be impaired 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests in december and  and determined that as of those dates our fair value exceeded the carrying value of our net assets 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment was recognized in or during the three month period ended june   we concluded that the decline in our market capitalization indicated that the carrying value of goodwill might be impaired 
as a result  we conducted an impairment assessment as required under sfas no 
by comparing our fair value to our net assets  including goodwill  as of june  because the carrying value of our net assets exceeded our fair value at june   we determined that our goodwill had been impaired 
to determine the amount of the impairment charge  we calculated our implied goodwill as the difference between our fair value and the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
the fair value of our intangible assets  principally consisting of completed and in process technology  was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
based on this valuation  we determined that our implied goodwill was  and we recorded a non cash charge in the quarter ended june   of  to write down our existing goodwill 

table of contents the goodwill impairment analysis as of june  involved considerable judgment and the use of several estimates including control premium  discount rates  projected cash flows of op  a bone regeneration product that we had developed under agreements with stryker corporation  and projected cash flows of our in process research and development programs 
the control premium used in determining our fair value was based on an analysis of control premiums involved in other biotechnology and medical products acquisitions 
most of our research and development programs will not be completed for several years  if ever  and therefore estimating the costs to complete these programs and the revenue to be derived through collaborations and commercialization of the products involves substantial judgment 
the discount rates used to determine the net present value of these cash flows were based on a consideration of the risks associated with achieving these cash flow projections  including the risk of successfully completing our in process technology 
all of these estimates involve a significant amount of judgment by our management 
although the estimates used reflect management s best estimates based upon all available evidence  the use of different estimates could have yielded different results in our transitional impairment assessment conducted as of january   and in our impairment assessment conducted in the second quarter of had we used a significantly lower control premium in determining our fair value  our transitional impairment analysis could have indicated that goodwill was impaired at january  in addition  using different estimated cash flows or discount rates in determining our implied goodwill in the second quarter of could have resulted in a higher or lower goodwill impairment charge 
long term receivables 
during the year ended december   we recorded  in other expense  charges of  related to the write off of a euro denominated note receivable that was originally due in june from micromet  a former collaborator  and  related to a reduction in the carrying value of micromet equity securities held by us 
we determined that this charge was necessary due to micromet s announcement that it was terminating one third of its workforce as the result of a contract dispute with a collaborator 
micromet had stated that this dispute would result in a significant decrease in previously budgeted cash inflows in on october   we amended our note receivable with micromet  and  under the amended note  micromet is obligated to pay us a total amount of eur  subject to certain conditions 
as a result of micromet s financing in october  we received a eur  payment in november  resulting in a gain of  based on the euro to us dollar foreign exchange rate 
the terms of micromet s financing adversely affect the carrying value of the equity we hold in micromet and  therefore  we recorded a  write down of the carrying value from  to our estimated fair value of the investment of  the  net gain was recorded in other income for the year ended december  the future amounts due to us under the amended note payable will be recorded in other income when and if such amounts are collected 
valuation of investments in privately held companies 
we have investments in aegera  micromet and es cell international with carrying values of   and  respectively 
these investments are included in the deposits and other assets category of our consolidated balance sheets 
at each balance sheet date  we review these investments to determine whether the fair value of these investments is less than the carrying value and  if so  whether we should write down the investment 
these companies are not publicly traded and  therefore  determining the fair value of our investments in these companies involves significant judgment 
we consider available information in estimating the fair value of these investments and  as of december   believe that the fair value of our investments is not less than their carrying value after taking into effect the write down of the micromet investment 
if the financial condition or results of aegera or es cell decline significantly or if micromet s financial condition continues to decline  the fair value of these investments would likely decline and  as a result  we may have to record an impairment charge to the extent such impairment is deemed other than temporary 
revenue recognition 
revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition  and eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accordance 
table of contents with sab no 
 we recognize revenue related to research activities as they are performed  so long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
we analyze our multiple element arrangements entered into since july to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting in accordance with eitf no 
we recognize license payments as revenue when received if the license has stand alone value and the fair value of the undelivered items can be determined 
if the license is considered to have stand alone value but the fair value on any of the undelivered items cannot be determined  the license payments are recognized as revenue over the period of performance for such undelivered items or services 
amounts received for license fees are deferred and recognized as services are performed over the performance period of the contract 
any obligations related directly to the receipt of a license fee are also deferred and recognized as services are performed over the performance period of the contract 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone  as long as the milestone is deemed to be substantive and we have no other performance obligations with respect to that milestone 
in the event that we have remaining performance obligations  the portion of the milestone payment equal to the lesser of the non refundable cash received or the percentage of the services performed through that date multiplied by the total milestone payment would be recognized as revenue 
revenue received under grants is being recognized as the services are provided and payment is assured under the terms of the grant 
based upon the application of our revenue recognition policies  and our related estimates and judgments  we have recognized revenue under our key collaborations  license agreements and grant as follows genentech collaboration 
on december   we entered into an amendment to our collaboration agreement with genentech 
the amendment  effective from june  to june   increases genentech s funding commitment from  to  for this period 
under the terms of the amended collaboration agreement  genentech committed to pay an incremental payment of  for support of full time equivalents in our collaboration with genentech 
we are required to commit up to sixteen employees to the systemic hedgehog antagonist program through june  we are recognizing this reimbursement of research and development services as revenue over the six month period through june  as services are performed based on the actual staffing level 
in december  we determined that the performance period covered by the genentech license fee should be extended through june  from our previous estimate of october the change in estimate related to a change in our estimate of the period during which we will provide services under the collaboration  defined as the time to market of our basal cell carcinoma product under co development with genentech 
this change will be applied prospectively and therefore did not have an effect on previously recognized revenue 
we recognized  in revenue related to our collaboration with genentech for the year ended december  of this amount   was from the amortization of the  in license and up front payments received from genentech 
we expect that the remainder of the license fees will be recognized on a straight line basis through june as the remaining services are performed 
we recognized expenses of  for the year ended december   for the amortization of obligations related to these license fees 
in addition  we recognized revenues of  relating to other research and development services performed under the collaboration agreement with genentech for the year ended december  we recognized  in revenue for the year ended december   related solely to the amortization of the genentech license fee 
wyeth collaboration 
we recognized  in revenue related to our collaboration with wyeth for the year ended december  this amount consists of revenue of  from the amortization of a  license fee payment received from wyeth in february we expect that the remainder of the license fee will be recognized on a straight line basis through february  our remaining service period 
we recognized expenses of  for the year ended december   for the amortization of 
table of contents obligations related to the license fee 
in addition  we recognized  relating to research and development services performed under the collaboration agreement with wyeth for the year ended december  as of december   we were meeting the staffing requirements under the collaboration and expect to continue to meet staffing  as determined by wyeth  through the remainder of the performance period 
since our collaboration with wyeth was not effective until february  no revenue related to wyeth was recognized in spinal muscular atrophy foundation 
we recognized  relating to research and development services performed under the  three year grant from the spinal muscular atrophy foundation for the year ended december  future revenues received under this grant will be recognized as the services are provided and payment is assured under the terms of the grant 
since this grant was not received until september  no revenue related to the spinal muscular atrophy foundation was recognized in es cell international collaboration 
our collaboration with es cell international was terminated in december accordingly  we recognized no revenue related to this collaboration during for the year ended december   we recognized  of revenues relating to research and development services performed under this collaboration 
although we follow detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
for example  in connection with our existing collaboration agreements  we have recorded on our balance sheet short and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
we have recorded short term deferred revenue of  and long term deferred revenue of  as of december  short term deferred revenue consists of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue by december  amounts that we expect will not be recognized prior to december  are classified as long term deferred revenue 
however  this estimate is based on our current operating plan as of december  if our operating plan should change in the future  we may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the twelve month period from january   through december the estimate of deferred revenue reflects management s estimate of the periods of our involvement in certain of our collaborations 
our performance obligations under these collaborations consist of participation on steering committees and the performance of other research and development services 
our period of involvement is largely determined by the time to commercialize our basal cell carcinoma clinical candidate that we are co developing with genentech and our estimate of time to reach clinical development for candidates under our collaboration with wyeth 
since the timing of clinical development is difficult to estimate  our estimates may change in the future 
such changes to estimates would result in a change in revenue recognition amounts 
if these estimates and judgments change over the course of these agreements  it may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize and record in future periods 
stock based compensation 
we issue stock options to employees under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
these options are accounted for under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  including fasb interpretation no 
all stock based awards to non employees are accounted for at their fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by fasb no 
 and emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees 
sfas requires that companies either recognize compensation expense for grants of stock options and other equity instruments based on fair value  or provide pro forma disclosure of net loss and net loss per share in the notes to the financial statements 
at december   we had two stock based compensation plans 
we account for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
accordingly  no compensation cost has been recognized under sfas for the our employee stock option plans 
under sfas no 
 the fair value of stock based awards to employees is calculated through the use of option pricing models  even though such models were developed to estimate the fair value of freely tradable  
table of contents fully transferable options without vesting restrictions  which significantly differ from our stock option awards 
these models also require subjective assumptions  including risk free interest rates  future stock price volatility and expected time to exercise  which greatly affect the calculated values 
we calculate compensation cost with the black scholes option pricing model 
the above list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues total revenues are summarized as follows for the year ended december  percentage increase decrease research and development contracts license fees and royalties total revenues revenues from research and development contracts increased by  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  research and development contract revenues for the year ended december  were primarily derived from revenue recognized under our collaborations with genentech and wyeth of  and  respectively 
in addition  we recognized revenue of  for the year ended december  under our sponsored research agreement with the spinal muscular atrophy foundation 
for the year ended december   research and development contract revenues primarily consisted of  recognized under a licensing agreement with es cell international 
effective december  and consistent with the terms of this agreement  we are no longer providing research and development services for es cell international and will therefore not recognize future revenues related to this collaboration 
the decrease in revenue from license fees and royalties of  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily consisted of  in previously deferred revenue which was recognized upon the termination of our collaboration with micromet during the third quarter of license fee revenues for the year ended december  were derived from revenue recognized under our collaborations with genentech and wyeth of  and  respectively 

table of contents operating expenses research and development expenses are summarized as follows for the year ended december  percentage increase decrease research and development program primary indication hh small molecule antagonist basal cell carcinoma   hh small molecule and antibody antagonist cancer   hh small molecule agonist nervous system disorders   hh small molecule agonist hair growth   discovery research spinal muscular atrophy  na discovery research various including wnt  na other programs total research and development expense the decrease of  in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was primarily due to the net effect of changes in spending in our research programs 
first  we decreased spending by  or  on other programs 
included in other programs were expenses incurred for contract research and development services performed under our diabetes cell therapy program that was under collaboration with es cell international 
the contract research component of this collaboration ended in december and  accordingly  we are no longer incurring costs related to this program 
in addition  costs related to our nervous system disorders program were significantly reduced as compared to these decreases were partially offset by increases in spending under our cancer program  which is under collaboration with genentech 
the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to a  increase in chemistry expenses related to potential small molecule antagonist product candidates for the treatment of various cancers as well as increases in license fees  personnel costs and related lab supplies 
genentech reimbursed us for all chemistry costs incurred under our collaboration for in addition  we initiated new discovery research programs in we incurred costs of  for our spinal muscular atrophy program  which is under collaboration with the spinal muscular atrophy foundation  and  in expenses related to our other discovery research programs during the year ended december  we incurred no expenses for these programs during the same period in general and administrative expenses are summarized as follows for the year ended december  percentage increase decrease personnel occupancy and depreciation legal services professional and consulting services insurance costs reserve against settlement of notes receivable other general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses the increase of  in total general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of  legal fees of  and professional and consulting services of  the increases principally resulted from costs associated with various technology acquisition evaluations  expenses associated with financing related activities during the first half of  an increase in legal patent expenses  an increase in personnel  and costs associated with compliance with

this decrease was offset by an increase in compensation expense recognized on options issued to non employees 
we recorded  and  in stock based compensation related to non employee options for the years ended december  and  respectively 
amortization of intangible assets was  for each of the years ended december  and other income expense for the year ended december   interest income was  as compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase in interest income resulted from a higher available investment balance for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   other income was  as compared to other expense of  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase was principally due to the receipt of  on a note receivable from micromet  a former collaborator  offset by a  write down of our investment in micromet resulting in a net gain of  in the fourth quarter of the note had been written off during the fourth quarter of resulting in an impairment charge of  for year ended december  for the year ended december   interest expense was  as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or

the joint venture was terminated on may  and the convertible exchangeable preferred stock was cancelled as part of the termination 
the amount is included in the net loss applicable to common stockholders for the year ended december  net loss applicable to common stockholders as a result of the foregoing  we incurred a net loss applicable to common stockholders of  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  
table of contents years ended december  and revenues total revenues are summarized as follows for the year ended december  percentage increase decrease research and development contracts license fees and royalties total revenues the increase in revenue from research and development contracts for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to our recognition of  in the year ended december   relating to research and development services performed by us under our licensing agreement with es cell international 
effective december  and consistent with the terms of this agreement  we are no longer providing research and development services and will therefore not recognize future revenues related to this collaboration 
the research and development contract revenue for the year ended december  was derived entirely from revenue recognized under our licensing agreement with es cell international and our former collaboration with micromet 
our license fee revenue for the year ended december  primarily consisted of  in previously deferred revenue which was recognized upon the termination of our collaboration with micromet during the third quarter of the decrease in license fees and royalty revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to the recognition of revenue upon the completion of various transactions in  including  in revenue we recognized upon stryker s buy out of its royalty obligation to us for op and  in revenue we recognized from an up front payment received by us in connection with the licensing of certain of our bmp technologies to ortho biotech products 
in addition  we received  in royalty revenue from stryker on sales of op for the year ended december  as part of the stryker transaction  we will receive no future royalties on sales by stryker of op the decrease in license fee and royalty revenue from transactions in was partially offset by the micromet revenue described above 
operating expenses research and development expenses are summarized as follows primary indication for the year ended december  percentage increase decrease research and development program hh small molecule antagonist basal cell carcinoma   hh small molecule and antibody antagonist cancer   hh small molecule agonist nervous system disorders   hh small molecule agonist hair growth  other programs costs allocated to curis newco joint venture total research and development expense 
table of contents in the foregoing table  other programs includes research and development expenses relating to adult stem cell and cell therapy programs 
for the years ended december  and   and  respectively  related to our adult stem cell and cell therapy programs 
as further described below  we reduced expenses incurred under our adult stem cell and cell therapy programs in connection with our business realignment in costs allocated to the curis newco joint venture relate to research expenses incurred by us and charged to curis newco  a joint venture that  until may   was operated by us and affiliates of elan corporation 
these amounts related to our nervous system disorders program 
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to the termination of our collaboration with elan  offset by a reduction in ongoing operating costs as a result of our business realignment in the first quarter of  including reductions in amounts spent on stem cell and cell therapy programs 
as a result of this realignment  our research and development expenses were focused principally on regulatory signaling pathways  particularly the hedgehog pathway  for the year ended december   and spending on our stem cell  cell therapy and other programs decreased by an aggregate of  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  reductions in spending on our stem cell  cell therapy and other programs were offset by the termination of our collaboration with elan  which resulted in no research and development expense being charged to curis newco in as compared to  in in  our research and development expenses were presented net of these expenses charged to curis newco 
general and administrative expenses are summarized as follows for the year ended december  percentage increase decrease personnel occupancy and depreciation legal services professional and consulting services reserve against notes receivable insurance costs other general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to a reduction in ongoing operating costs as a result of our business realignment in the first quarter of  including reductions in personnel costs and legal and professional services 
in addition  the amount charged to reserve for the possible non collection of notes receivable outstanding to two former officers decreased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  stock based compensation decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the amount of stock based compensation expense related to our issuance on august  of stock options with exercise prices below fair market value 
we recorded  and  in stock based compensation related to these options for the years ended december  and  respectively 
because these options were issued with exercise prices below fair market value  we recorded deferred compensation and have been amortizing the deferred compensation over the four year vesting period of the options 
when an option holder s employment with us is terminated  we treated any unvested portion of their options and related deferred compensation as charged to additional paid in capital rather than stock based compensation 
accordingly  the departure of four officers and additional employees as a result of the 
table of contents realignment of our business and a subsequent staff reduction in december has resulted in a decrease in stock based compensation expense  as the remaining deferred compensation balance associated with each terminated employees august  stock options was immediately charged to additional paid in capital 
amortization of intangible assets decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to an impairment charge of approximately  that we recorded during the fourth quarter of the year ended december   to reduce the carrying value of patents associated with our op technology that is licensed to stryker 
the charge was recorded as a result of our transaction with stryker  under which stryker bought out its future royalty obligation to us on sales of op for  we wrote these patents off because we will not receive any future royalties or other revenue from stryker and because these patents cannot be utilized for alternative uses in either current or future operations 
loss on property and equipment for the year ended december   of  related to impairment on assets at our facility at erie street in cambridge  massachusetts 
the total carrying value of assets at the erie street facility before the impairment charge was approximately  the property and equipment assets at the erie street facility were used to support clinical programs that were suspended or terminated as part of the realignment and were deemed to be unlikely to be used in our future operations 
of the impairment charge   related to the write off of tenant improvements made to the erie street facility since such improvements were affixed to the facility and therefore could not have been sold separately 
the remaining  of impairment charge was to write down furniture and equipment assets to their estimated salvage value 
we do not expect to incur additional impairment on property and equipment related to the realignment in future periods 
the amount we received from the sale of these assets was not significantly different from the originally estimated salvage value 
impairment of goodwill for the year ended december  was  in accordance with sfas no 
 we concluded that the decline in our market capitalization during the three month period ended june  indicated that the carrying value of our goodwill might be impaired 
accordingly  we conducted an impairment review as required under sfas no 
as of june   and determined that goodwill impairment had occurred as of june  our value  as a single reporting unit  was calculated using quoted market prices adjusted to provide for a control premium 
in calculating the impairment charge  the fair value of our intangible assets  principally consisting of completed and in process technology  was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
realignment expenses of  were recorded for the year ended december  these charges relate to  associated with workforce reductions of people  including officers   associated with the closing of clinical programs and decommissioning of a manufacturing and development facility and other costs of  as of december   we expended approximately all of the  in realignment expenses 
we do not expect to incur additional expenses related to this realignment in future periods 
equity in loss from joint venture we recorded no equity in loss from joint venture during the year ended december   as compared to  during the year ended december  the equity in loss from joint venture relates to a joint venture  curis newco  which we formed in july with affiliates of elan corporation 
this joint venture was terminated on may  as a result of the termination  we now own of the outstanding shares of curis newco 
other income expense for the year ended december   interest income was  as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease in interest income resulted from a lower available investment balance and lower average investment yields for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  
table of contents for the year ended december   other expense was  as compared to other income of  for the year ended december   a decrease of  this decrease was principally due to an impairment charge of  for the write off of a euro denominated note receivable from micromet  a former collaborator  during the fourth quarter of the year ended december   as well as a decrease in the gain recognized on currency rate fluctuations on the micromet note receivable of  in addition  the amount of gain recognized on sales of securities decreased by  in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  we recognized gains on sales of securities of  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   interest expense was  as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease in interest expense resulted from the decrease in the amount of interest expense that we paid on capital leases in compared to accretion on series a convertible exchangeable preferred stock accretion of preferred stock dividend for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this charge relates to the accretion of a mandatory dividend on shares of convertible exchangeable preferred stock issued to an affiliate of elan as part of a joint venture with elan 
the decrease is attributed to the termination of the joint venture on may   in which the convertible exchangeable preferred stock was cancelled as part of the termination 
the amounts are included in the net loss applicable to common stockholders for the years ended december  and net loss applicable to common stockholders as a result of the foregoing  we incurred a net loss applicable to common stockholders of  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through license fees  research and development funding from our collaborators  the private and public placement of our equity securities  debt financings and the monetization of certain royalty rights 
at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of  excluding restricted long term investments of  our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at date of purchase and consist of time deposits and investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions  short term commercial paper  and government obligations 
we also maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits 
however  we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances because the balances are invested in highly rated securities 
our marketable securities are investments with original maturities of greater than three months  but less than twelve months  and consist of commercial paper  corporate debt securities  and government obligations 
the use of our cash flows for operations has primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our office and laboratory  fees paid in connection with preclinical studies  laboratory supplies  consulting fees  and legal fees 
to date  the source of our cash flows from operations has been payments received from our collaborators 
in general  our only source of cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future will be the up front license payments  payments for the achievement of milestones  and funded research and development that we may receive under collaboration agreements 
the timing of any new collaboration agreements and any payments under collaboration agreements cannot be easily predicted and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was primarily to fund our net loss of  partially offset by  in non cash charges including stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization  non cash interest expense on notes payable  amortization of intangible assets  a gain on recovery of officers notes receivable relating to prior officers of a predecessor company and an impairment of an investment in micromet  a former collaborator of ours 
in addition  a  up front payment received for a licensing agreement with wyeth and a  maintenance fee payment received from genentech further offset our use of cash 
we expect that our cash used in operations will increase as we begin to incur costs under the equal co development and cost sharing arrangement for our basal cell carcinoma product candidate under development with genentech 
in addition  our cash used in operations could further increase if we seek to develop additional products toward clinical trials and as we advance new products into preclinical development 
we also expect that the increase in cash used will be partially offset by anticipated payments made under our collaborations with genentech  wyeth and the spinal muscular atrophy foundation  assuming these collaborations continue in accordance with their terms 
net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was primarily to fund our net loss of  partially offset by  in non cash charges including stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization  non cash interest expense on notes payable  amortization of intangible assets and an impairment of a long term note receivable and investment in micromet  a former collaborator of ours 
in addition  we used  of operating cash as a result of changes in certain of our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended december  investing activities used cash of  for the year ended december  as compared to  in cash generated for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities resulted principally from  in net investment purchases and  in fixed asset purchases for the year ended december  we expect that we will continue to use cash in our investing activities as we expand our infrastructure 
we expect that our cash spent on fixed asset purchases will decline in the  spent on fixed assets in related to equipment associated with a new screening program and to the partial completion of a laboratory build out that will be used to improve our capacity to conduct preclinical disease models 
we expect that we will complete the laboratory build out during the first quarter of net cash generated for the year ended december   was driven by a reduction in restricted cash balances of  resulting from the full repayment of our loan agreement with the boston private bank trust company 
financing activities generated  of net cash for the year ended december   as compared to net cash generated by financing activities of  for the year ended december  the cash generated by financing activities during was principally the result of the sale of  of our common stock  including  in net proceeds from a registered direct offering of  shares of newly issued common stock  and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock  in october   from the sale of  shares of common stock to wyeth and  in proceeds received upon stock option exercises 
in addition  proceeds from the issuance of debt for the purchase of fixed assets provided  for the year ended december  these increases were offset by  in repayments of obligations under capital leases 
during  we expect to borrow the remaining  against our boston private bank trust company loan agreement as we will complete construction on our laboratory build out in the first quarter of the cash generated by financing activities during was principally the result of the sale of  of our common stock  including  from a private placement of  shares of common stock  and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  in august   from the sale of  shares of common stock to genentech  and  in proceeds received upon stock option exercises 
these amounts were partially offset by repayments of debt totaling  including  in full repayment of our debt with the boston private bank trust company   as partial repayment of our convertible promissory note payable to elan pursuant to our may  termination agreement  and  in repayments of notes payable and capital leases 

table of contents pursuant to the terms of our collaboration agreement with genentech  on january  we elected to exercise a co development option with genentech pursuant to which we will now share equally in us development costs and any future net profits and or losses derived from sales in the us of a therapeutic product candidate for the topical treatment of basal cell carcinoma 
we expect that by exercising this co development and equal cost sharing option we will incur approximately  in development expenses through phase ii clinical trials  a portion of which will be booked in the first quarter of we plan to assist genentech in filing an investigational new drug application with the fda in order to initiate human clinical investigation of the basal cell carcinoma product candidate 
assuming the acceptance of the investigational new drug application by the fda and the successful advancement of the basal cell carcinoma product candidate through phase i and phase ii clinical trials  we expect that the phase ii clinical trial will be completed in mid we expect to incur additional costs to complete phase iii clinical trials and complete the regulatory approval process  assuming that we and genentech successfully complete phase ii clinical trials 
effective september   we cancelled an existing loan agreement with the boston private bank trust company and entered into a new loan agreement to finance up to  in purchases of equipment and facility leasehold improvements through february  we have financed  for purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements that accrue interest at a variable rate of as of december  on january   we entered into an amendment to extend the drawdown date in which we can request periodic financings for qualifying purchases of equipment and leaseholds under the loan agreement through april  until such time  we will pay interest only on any borrowings on a monthly basis in arrears 
we then have the option to either repay the then outstanding balance in full or convert the then outstanding balance into a month term note that bears interest at either a variable rate as of december  or a fixed rate as of december  for the repayment period 
as of december   we consider this obligation to be short term since we have not yet exercised the option to convert the balance to a term note 
the loan is collateralized by all of our property  plant and equipment assets  except for those that are affixed to the property and those that are purchased after april  under purchase money arrangements with equipment lenders 
on may   we and affiliates of elan corporation entered into a termination agreement to conclude the joint venture that was originally formed in july as part of the termination  we entered into an amended and restated convertible note payable with epil with the principal amount of  the terms of the amended and restated note were substantially the same as those under the original note  except that the interest rate was reduced from to and the conversion rate was increased from to 
as of december   there was approximately  including approximately  in accrued interest  outstanding under this convertible note payable 
on january   elan elected to convert the then outstanding balance of  into  shares of our common stock  based on a conversion price of per share 
we have no further obligations under this convertible note payable 
on june   we received  from becton dickinson under a convertible subordinated note payable in connection with the exercise by becton dickinson of an option to negotiate a collaboration agreement 
the note is repayable at any time up to its maturity date of june  by us  at our discretion  in either cash or upon issuance to becton dickinson of shares of our common stock 
the note bears interest at 
as of december   there was approximately  including approximately  in accrued interest  outstanding under the note agreement 

table of contents contractual obligations in addition to our loan agreement with boston private bank trust company  we also have contractual obligations related to our facility lease  research services agreements  consulting agreements  and license agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations due by the period indicated at december  amounts in s thereafter total debt obligations convertible subordinated long term debt operating lease obligations outside service obligations licensing obligations total future obligations convertible subordinated debt of  due in is payable to becton dickinson and is convertible into either shares of our common stock or payable in cash at our option 
on january   elan pharma international limited  or epil  notified us of its election to convert the entire balance of its outstanding note  originally due july  into shares of our common stock 
as of january   the outstanding balance  including interest  of the epil note was  in accordance with the terms of the amended and restated convertible note payable with epil   shares of our common stock were issued to epil based on a conversion rate of per share 
we have no further obligations to epil 
outside service obligations consist of agreements we have with outside labs  consultants and various other service organizations 
obligations do not include amounts we will owe genentech under our elected option to co develop a basal cell carcinoma product candidate 
we anticipate that existing capital resources at december   should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into mid  including spending related to the co development of our basal cell carcinoma product candidate under development with genentech 
we expect to incur substantial additional research and development and other costs  including costs related to preclinical studies and clinical trials for the foreseeable future 
our ability to continue funding planned operations beyond mid is dependent upon the success of our collaborations  our ability to maintain or reduce our cash burn rate and our ability to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  or from other sources of financing 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flows depends on a number of factors  including the ability of either us  or our collaborators  to obtain regulatory approval to market and commercialize products to treat indications in major commercial markets 
we are seeking additional collaborative arrangements and also expect to raise funds through one or more financing transactions  if conditions permit 
due to our significant long term capital requirements  we intend to seek to raise funds through the sale of debt or equity securities when conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at such time 
additional financing may not be available or  if available  it may not be available on favorable terms 
in addition  the sale of additional debt or equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if substantial additional funding is not available  our ability to fund research and development and other operations will be significantly affected and  accordingly  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our revenue and results of operations since inception 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as an expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed 
prior to sfas no 
r  only certain pro forma disclosures of fair value were required 
the provisions of this statement are effective for the first interim reporting period that begins after june  accordingly  we will implement the revised standard in the third quarter of fiscal year currently  we account for our share based payment transactions under the provisions of apb  which does not necessarily require the recognition of compensation cost in the financial statements 
we are evaluating our current compensation strategies as they relate to stock based compensation 
management is assessing the implications of this revised standard  including any cumulative catch up adjustments  which will materially impact our results of operations in the third quarter of fiscal year and thereafter 
in december  the financial accounting standards board also issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
this statement amends apb opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
under sfas no 
 if a nonmonetary exchange of similar productive assets meets a commercial substance criterion and fair value is determinable  the transaction must be accounted for at fair value resulting in recognition of any gain or loss 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary transactions in fiscal periods that begin after june  we do not anticipate that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that may affect results risks relating to our financial results and need for financing we have incurred substantial losses  we expect to continue to incur substantial losses and we may never achieve profitability 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future  and we have no current sources of material ongoing revenue 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  other than op  which we and stryker commercialized under a former collaboration  we have not commercialized any products to date  either alone or with a third party collaborator 
if we are not able to commercialize any products  whether alone or with a collaborator  we will not achieve profitability 
even if our collaboration agreements provide funding for a portion of our research and development expenses for some of our programs  we expect to spend significant capital to fund our internal research and development programs for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve profitability 
we cannot be certain whether or when this will occur because of the significant uncertainties that affect our business 
our failure to become and remain profitable may depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital  expand our business  diversify our product offerings or continue our operations 
we will require additional financing  which may be difficult to obtain and may dilute your ownership interest in us 
we will require substantial funds to continue our research and development programs 
we believe that our existing cash and working capital should be sufficient to fund our operations until mid  however  our future 
table of contents capital requirements may vary from what we expect 
there are factors that may affect our future capital requirements and accelerate our need for additional financing 
many of these factors are outside our control  including the following continued progress in our research and development programs  as well as the magnitude of these programs  the cost of additional facilities requirements including the current expansion of the animal facility and such others as may be required  our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements  the timing  receipt and amount of research funding and milestone  license  royalty and other payments  if any  from collaborators  the timing  payment and amount of research funding and milestone  license  royalty and other payments due to licensors of patent rights and technology used to make  use and sell our product candidates  the timing  receipt and amount of sales revenues and associated royalties to us  if any  from our product candidates in the market  and the costs of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and technology license fees 
we expect to seek additional funding through public or private financings and may seek additional funding for programs that are not currently licensed to collaborators  from new strategic collaborators 
however  the biotechnology market in general  and the market for our common stock  in particular  is highly volatile 
due to market conditions and the status of our development pipeline  additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we fail to obtain such additional financing on a timely basis  our ability to continue all of our research and development  activities will be adversely affected 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to our stockholders will result 
in addition  the terms of such a financing may adversely affect other rights of our stockholders 
we also could elect to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies  product candidates or products 
if the estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate  our actual results may vary significantly 
our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the amounts of charges taken by us and related disclosure 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we cannot assure you that our estimates  or the assumptions underlying them  will be correct 
accordingly  our actual financial results may vary significantly from the estimates contained in our financial statements 

table of contents risks relating to our collaborations we are dependent on collaborators for the development and commercialization of many of our product candidates 
if we lose any of these collaborators  of if they fail or delay in developing or commercializing our product candidates  our anticipated product pipeline and operating results would suffer 
the success of our strategy for development and commercialization of product candidates depends upon our ability to form and maintain productive strategic collaborations 
we currently have strategic collaborations with genentech  ortho biotech products  and wyeth 
we expect to enter into additional collaborations in the future 
our existing and any future collaborations may not be scientifically or commercially successful 
the risks that we face in connection with these collaborations include the following each of our collaborators has significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to the collaboration 
the timing and amount of any future royalty and milestone revenue that we may receive under such collaborative arrangements will depend on  among other things  such collaborator s efforts and allocation of resources 
all of our strategic collaboration agreements are for fixed terms and are subject to termination under various circumstances  including in some cases  on short notice without cause 
if any collaborator were to terminate an agreement  we may be required to undertake product development  manufacturing and commercialization and we may not have the funds or capability to do this  which could result in a discontinuation of such program 
our collaborators may develop and commercialize  either alone or with others  products and services that are similar to or competitive with the products and services that are the subject of the collaboration with us 
our collaborators may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies historically have re evaluated their priorities following mergers and consolidations  which have been common in recent years in these industries 
the ability of certain of our product candidates to reach their potential could be limited if our collaborators decrease or fail to increase spending related to such product candidates 
we may not be successful in establishing additional strategic collaborations  which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products 
as an integral part of our ongoing research and development efforts  we periodically review opportunities to establish new collaborations  joint ventures and strategic collaborations for the development and commercialization of products in our development pipeline 
we face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and the negotiation process is time consuming and complex 
we may not be successful in our efforts to establish additional strategic collaborations or other alternative arrangements 
even if we are successful in our efforts to establish a collaboration or agreement  the terms that we establish may not be favorable to us 
finally  such strategic alliances or other arrangements may not result in successful products and associated revenue 

table of contents risks related to our business  industry  strategy and operations we face substantial competition  which may result in our competitors discovering  developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do 
our product candidates face competition with existing and new products being developed by biotechnology  medical device and pharmaceutical companies  as well as universities and other research institutions 
for example  research in the fields of regulatory signaling pathways and functional genomics  which includes our work with genentech in the field of cancer  with ortho biotech products in the field of renal disease  and with wyeth in the field of neurology  is highly competitive 
a number of entities are seeking to identify and patent randomly sequenced genes and gene fragments  typically without specific knowledge of the function that such genes or gene fragments perform 
our competitors may discover  characterize and develop important inducing molecules or genes in advance of us 
we also face competition from these and other entities in gaining access to dna samples used in our research and development projects 
many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities than we have 
efforts by other biotechnology  medical device and pharmaceutical companies could render our programs or products uneconomical or result in therapies superior to those that we develop alone or with a collaborator 
for those programs that we have selected for further internal development  we face competition from companies that are more experienced in product development and commercialization  obtaining regulatory approvals and product manufacturing 
as a result  they may develop competing products more rapidly and at a lower cost 
for those programs that are subject to a collaboration agreement  competitors may discover  develop and commercialize products which render our products non competitive or obsolete 
we expect competition to intensify in genomics research and regulatory signaling pathways as technical advances in the field are made and become more widely known 
since our technologies have many potential applications and we have limited resources  our election to focus on a particular application may result in our failure to capitalize on other potentially profitable applications of our technologies 
we have limited financial and managerial resources 
these limitations require us to focus on a select group of product candidates in specific therapeutic areas and to forego the exploration of other product opportunities 
while our technologies may permit us to work in multiple areas  resource commitments may require trade offs resulting in delays in the development of certain programs or research areas  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
our decisions as to resource allocation may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources away from other market opportunities which ultimately prove to be more profitable 
if we or our collaborators fail to achieve market acceptance for our products under development  our future revenue and ability to achieve profitability may be adversely affected 
our future products  if any are successfully developed  may not gain commercial acceptance among physicians  patients and third party payors  even if necessary marketing approvals have been obtained 
we believe that recommendations and endorsements by physicians will be essential for market acceptance of our products 
if we are not able to obtain a positive reception for our products  our expected revenues from sales of these products would be adversely affected 
we could be exposed to significant risk from liability claims if we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable costs or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims 
product liability claims  inherent in the process of researching and developing human health care products  could expose us to significant liabilities and prevent or interfere with the development or commercialization of our product candidates 
product liability claims would require us to spend significant time  money and other resources to defend such claims and could ultimately lead to our having to pay a significant damage award 
product liability insurance is expensive to procure for biopharmaceutical companies such as ours 
although we maintain product liability insurance coverage for the clinical trials of our products under development  it is 
table of contents possible that we will not be able to obtain additional product liability insurance on acceptable terms  if at all  and that our product liability insurance coverage will not prove to be adequate to protect us from all potential claims 
our growth could be limited if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and consultants 
our success depends on the ability to attract  train and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel to further our research and development efforts 
the loss of services of one or more of our key employees or consultants could have a negative impact on our business and operating results 
locating candidates with the appropriate qualifications can be difficult 
although we expect to be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees for the foreseeable future  we may not be able to do so 
any growth and expansion into areas and activities that may require additional human resources or expertise  such as regulatory affairs and compliance  would require us to either hire new key personnel or obtain such services via an outsourcing arrangement 
the pool of personnel with the skills that we require is limited 
we may not be able to hire or contract such additional personnel 
risks relating to intellectual property if we breach any of the agreements under which we license or have acquired intellectual property from others  we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business 
we are a party to intellectual property licenses and agreements that are important to our business and expect to enter into similar licenses and agreements in the future 
these licenses and agreements impose various research  development  commercialization  sublicensing  royalty  indemnification  insurance and other obligations on us 
if we or our collaborators fail to perform under these agreements or otherwise breach obligations thereunder  we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business 
we may not be able to obtain patent protection for our discoveries and our technologies may be found to infringe patent rights of third parties 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including ours  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal  scientific and factual questions 
the long term success of our enterprise depends in significant part on our ability to obtain patents to protect our discoveries  protect trade secrets from disclosure to third party competitors  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
patents may not issue from any of the patent applications that we own or license 
if patents do issue  the allowed claims may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology from exploitation by our competitors 
in addition  issued patents that we own or license may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
our patents also may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology 
because patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until months after filing  it is possible that third parties have filed or maintained patent applications for technology used by us or covered by our pending patent applications without our knowledge 
we may not have rights under patents which may cover one or more of our product candidates 
in some cases  these patents may be owned or controlled by third party competitors and may impair our ability to exploit our technology 
as a result  we or our collaborative partners may be required to obtain licenses under third party patents to develop and commercialize some of our product candidates 
if we are unable to secure licenses to such patented technology on acceptable terms  we or our collaborative partners will not be able to develop and commercialize the affected product candidate or candidates 

table of contents if we are unable to keep our trade secrets confidential  our technology and proprietary information may be used by others to compete against us 
we rely significantly upon proprietary technology  information  processes and know how that is not subject to patent protection 
we seek to protect this information through confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and other third party contractors as well as through other security measures 
these confidentiality agreements and security measures may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
we may become involved in expensive patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings which could result in liability for damages or stop our development and commercialization efforts 
there have been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
we may become a party to patent litigation or other proceedings regarding intellectual property rights 
situations which may give rise to patent litigation or other disputes over the use of our intellectual property include initiation of litigation or other proceedings against third parties to enforce our patent rights  initiation of litigation or other proceedings against third parties to seek to invalidate the patents held by these third parties or to obtain a judgment that our product candidates do not infringe the third parties patents  participation in interference or opposition proceedings to determine the priority of invention if our competitors file patent applications that claim technology also claimed by us  initiation of litigation by third parties claiming that our processes or product candidates or the intended use of our product candidates infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights  and initiation of litigation by us or third parties seeking to enforce contract rights relating to intellectual property which may be important to our business 
the costs associated with any patent litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved favorably  will likely be substantial 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the cost of such litigation or other proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources 
if a patent litigation or other intellectual property proceeding is resolved unfavorably  we or our collaborative partners may be enjoined from manufacturing or selling our products and services without a license from the other party and be held liable for significant damages 
moreover  we may not be able to obtain required licenses on commercially acceptable terms or any terms at all 
in addition  we could be held liable for lost profits if we are found to have infringed a valid patent  or liable for treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a valid patent 
litigation results are highly unpredictable and we or our collaborative partners may not prevail in any patent litigation or other proceeding in which we may become involved 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could damage our ability to compete in the marketplace 
patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and expense 
if licensees or assignees of our intellectual property rights breach any of the agreements under which we have licensed or assigned our intellectual property to them  we could be deprived of important intellectual property rights and future revenue 
we are a party to intellectual property out licenses  collaborations and agreements that are important to our business and expect to enter into similar agreements with third parties in the future 
under these agreements  we license or transfer intellectual property to third parties and impose various research  development  
table of contents commercialization  sublicensing  royalty  indemnification  insurance  and other obligations on them 
if a third party fails to comply with these requirements  we generally retain the right to terminate the agreement  and to bring a legal action in court or in arbitration 
in the event of breach  we may need to enforce our rights under these agreements by resorting to arbitration or litigation 
during the period of arbitration or litigation  we may be unable to effectively use  assign or license the relevant intellectual property rights and may be deprived of current or future revenues that are associated with such intellectual property 
risks relating to clinical and regulatory matters we expect to rely heavily on third parties for the conduct of clinical trials of our product candidates 
if these clinical trials are not successful  or if we or our collaborators are not able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates 
in order to obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of our product candidates  we and our collaborators will be required to complete extensive preclinical studies as well as clinical trials in humans to demonstrate to the fda and foreign regulatory authorities that our product candidates are safe and effective 
we have limited experience in conducting clinical trials and expect to rely primarily on collaborative partners and contract research organizations for their performance and management of clinical trials of our product candidates 
clinical development  including preclinical testing  is a long  expensive and uncertain process 
accordingly  preclinical testing and clinical trials  if any  of our product candidates under development may not be successful 
we and our collaborators could experience delays in preclinical or clinical trials of any of our product candidates  obtain unfavorable results in a development program  or fail to obtain regulatory approval for the commercialization of a product 
preclinical studies or clinical trials may produce negative  inconsistent or inconclusive results  and we or our collaborators may decide  or regulators may require us  to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials 
the results from early clinical trials may not be statistically significant or predictive of results that will be obtained from expanded  advanced clinical trials 
furthermore  the timing and completion of clinical trials  if any  of our product candidates depend on  among other factors  the number of patients we will be required to enroll in the clinical trials and the rate at which those patients are enrolled 
any increase in the required number of patients  decrease in recruitment rates or difficulties retaining study participants may result in increased costs  program delays or both 
also  our products under development may not be effective in treating any of our targeted disorders or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects  toxicities or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their commercial use 
institutional review boards or regulators  including the fda  may hold  suspend or terminate our clinical research or the clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons  including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or if  in their opinion  the participating subjects are being exposed to unacceptable health risks 
additionally  the failure of third parties conducting or overseeing the operation of the clinical trials to perform their contractual or regulatory obligations in a timely fashion could delay the clinical trials 
failure of clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing 
any of these events would adversely affect our ability to market a product candidate 
the development process necessary to obtain regulatory approval is lengthy  complex and expensive 
if we and our collaborative partners do not obtain necessary regulatory approvals  then our business will be unsuccessful and the market price of our common stock will substantially decline 
to the extent that we  or our collaborative partners  are able to successfully advance a product candidate through the clinic  we  or such partner  will be required to obtain regulatory approval prior to marketing and selling such product 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is expensive 
the time required for fda and other approvals is uncertain and typically takes a number of years  depending on the complexity and novelty of the product 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals for many of our 
table of contents products under development is further complicated because some of these products use non traditional or novel materials in non traditional or novel ways  and the regulatory officials have little precedent to follow 
with respect to internal programs to date  we have limited experience in filing and prosecuting applications to obtain marketing approval 
any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we  or our collaborative partners  may market the product 
these limitations may restrict the size of the market for the product and affect reimbursement by third party payors 
in addition  regulatory agencies may not grant approvals on a timely basis or may revoke or significantly modify previously granted approvals 
we  or our collaborative partners  also are subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the manufacturing and marketing of our potential future products outside of the united states 
the approval procedure varies among countries  additional testing may be required in some jurisdictions  and the time required to obtain foreign approvals often differs from that required to obtain fda approvals 
moreover  approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries  and vice versa 
as a result of these factors  we or our collaborators may not successfully begin or complete clinical trials in the time periods estimated  if at all 
moreover  if we or our collaborators incur costs and delays in development programs or fail to successfully develop and commercialize products based upon our technologies  we may not become profitable and our stock price could decline 
even if marketing approval is obtained  any products we or our collaborators develop will be subject to ongoing regulatory oversight which may affect the successful commercialization of such products 
even if regulatory approval of a product candidate is obtained by us or our collaborators  the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product is marketed or require costly post marketing follow up studies 
after marketing approval for any product is obtained  the manufacturer and the manufacturing facilities for that product will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory agencies 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the product  or with the manufacturer or facility  may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
if there is a failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  we or our collaborator may be subject to fines  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  operating restrictions  and criminal prosecution 
we  and our collaborators  are subject to governmental regulations other than those imposed by the fda 
we  and any of our collaborators  may not be able to comply with these regulations  which could subject us  or such collaborators  to penalties and otherwise result in the limitation of our or such collaborators operations 
in addition to regulations imposed by the fda  we and our collaborators are subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the environmental protection act  the toxic substances control act  the research conservation and recovery act  as well as regulations administered by the nuclear regulatory commission  national restrictions on technology transfer  import  export and customs regulations and certain other local  state or federal regulations 
from time to time  other federal agencies and congressional committees have indicated an interest in implementing further regulation of biotechnology applications 
we are not able to predict whether any such regulations will be adopted or whether  if adopted  such regulations will apply to our business  or whether we or our collaborators would be able to comply with any applicable regulations 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with all applicable laws and regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury caused by these materials 

table of contents risks relating to product manufacturing and sales we will depend on our collaborators and third party manufacturers to produce most  if not all  of our products under development  and if these third parties do not successfully manufacture these products our business will be harmed 
we have no manufacturing experience or manufacturing capabilities 
in order to continue to develop products  apply for regulatory approvals  and commercialize our products  we or our collaborators must be able to manufacture products in clinical and commercial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements  at acceptable costs and in a timely manner 
the manufacture of our product candidates may be complex  difficult to accomplish and difficult to scale up when large scale production is required 
manufacture may be subject to delays  inefficiencies and poor or low yields of quality products 
the cost of manufacturing some of our products may make them prohibitively expensive 
if supplies of any of our product candidates or related materials become unavailable on a timely basis or at all or are contaminated or otherwise lost  clinical trials by us and our collaborators could be seriously delayed 
this is due to the fact that such materials are time consuming to manufacture and cannot be readily obtained from third party sources 
to the extent that we  or our collaborators  seek to enter into manufacturing arrangements with third parties  we and such collaborators will depend upon these third parties to perform their obligations in a timely and effective manner and in accordance with government regulations 
contract manufacturers may breach their manufacturing agreements because of factors beyond our control or may terminate or fail to renew a manufacturing agreement based on their own business priorities at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us 
contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic  unannounced inspection by the fda and corresponding state and foreign agencies or their designees to ensure strict compliance with current good manufacturing practices and other governmental regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
failure of contract manufacturers or our collaborators or us to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates  delays  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  seizures or recalls of product candidates  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business 
if we need to change manufacturers  the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies must approve these manufacturers in advance 
this would involve testing and pre approval inspections to ensure compliance with fda and foreign regulations and standards 
if third party manufacturers fail to perform their obligations  our competitive position and ability to generate revenue may be adversely affected in a number of ways  including  we and our collaborators may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials of products that are under development  we and our collaborators may be delayed in submitting applications for regulatory approvals for our product candidates  and we and our collaborators may not be able to meet commercial demands for any approved products 
we have no sales or marketing experience and  as such  will depend significantly on third parties who may not successfully sell our products 
we have no sales  marketing or product distribution experience 
if we receive required regulatory approvals  we plan to rely primarily on sales  marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties  including our collaborative partners 
for example  as part of our agreements with genentech  ortho biotech products and wyeth  we have granted our collaborators exclusive rights to distribute certain products resulting from such collaborations  if any are ever successfully developed 
we may have to enter into additional marketing arrangements in the future and we may not be able to enter into these additional arrangements on terms which are favorable to us  if at all 
in addition  we may have limited or no control over the sales  marketing and distribution activities of these third parties and sales through these third parties could be less profitable to us than direct sales 

table of contents these third parties could sell competing products and may devote insufficient sales efforts to our products 
our future revenues will be materially dependent upon the success of the efforts of these third parties 
we may seek to independently market products that are not already subject to marketing agreements with other parties 
if we determine to perform sales  marketing and distribution functions ourselves  we could face a number of additional risks  including we may not be able to attract and build a significant and skilled marketing staff or sales force  the cost of establishing a marketing staff or sales force may not be justifiable in light of the revenues generated by any particular product  and our direct sales and marketing efforts may not be successful 
risks related to our common stock our stock price will fluctuate significantly and the market price of our common stock could drop below the price you paid 
the trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
for example  our stock has traded as high as and as low as per share for the period january  through december  the stock market  particularly in recent years  has experienced significant volatility with respect to biopharmaceutical and biotechnology based company stocks 
the volatility of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology based company stocks often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies represented by the stock 
prices for our stock will be determined in the market place and may be influenced by many factors  including announcements regarding new technologies by us or our competitors  market conditions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors  rumors relating to us or our competitors  litigation or public concern about the safety of our potential products  actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  deviations in our operating results from the estimates of securities analysts  adverse results or delays in clinical trials being conducted by us or our collaborators  any intellectual property lawsuits involving us  sales of large blocks of our common stock  sales of our common stock by our executive officers  directors or significant stockholders  the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel  fda or international regulatory actions  and general market conditions 
while we cannot predict the individual effect that these factors may have on the price of our common stock  these factors  either individually or in the aggregate  could result in significant variations in price during any given period of time 
moreover  in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 

table of contents substantially all of our outstanding common stock may be sold into the market at any time 
this could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time 
these sales  or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares  could reduce the market price of our common stock 
as of december   we had outstanding approximately million shares of common stock 
substantially all of these shares may also be resold in the public market at any time 
in addition  we have a significant number of shares that are subject to outstanding options 
the exercise of these options and the subsequent sale of the underlying common stock could cause a further decline in our stock price 
these sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
we have anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control of our management  including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
in addition  these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest 
for example  we have divided our board of directors into three classes that serve staggered three year terms  we may issue shares of our authorized blank check preferred stock and our stockholders are limited in their ability to call special stockholder meetings 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder  generally a person which together with its affiliates owns  or within the last three years has owned  of our voting stock  for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
these provisions could discourage  delay or prevent a change in control transaction 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash balances in excess of operating requirements in cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  generally money market funds  corporate debt and government securities with an average maturity of less than one year 
all marketable securities are considered available for sale 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  because of the short term nature of the marketable securities  we do not believe that interest rate fluctuations would materially impair the principal amount of our investments 
our investments are investment grade securities  and deposits are with investment grade financial institutions 
we believe that the realization of losses due to changes in credit spreads is unlikely as we expect to hold our investments to maturity 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have operated primarily in the united states 
accordingly  we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
