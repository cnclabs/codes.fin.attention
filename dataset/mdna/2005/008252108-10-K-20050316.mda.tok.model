overview we are an asset management company with equity investments in a diverse group of mid sized investment management firms our affiliates 
as of december   our affiliated investment management firms managed approximately billion in assets across a broad range of investment styles and in three principal distribution channels mutual fund  institutional and high net worth 
we pursue a growth strategy designed to generate shareholder value through the internal growth of our existing business across these three channels  in addition to investments in mid sized investment management firms and strategic transactions and relationships designed to enhance our affiliates businesses and growth prospects 
through our affiliates  we provide more than investment products across a broad range of asset classes and investment styles in our three principal distribution channels 
we believe that our diversification across asset classes  investment styles and distribution channels helps to mitigate our exposure to the risks created by changing market environments 
the following summarizes our operations in our three principal distribution channels 
our affiliates provide advisory or sub advisory services to more than domestic and offshore mutual funds 
these funds are distributed to retail and institutional clients directly and through intermediaries  including independent investment advisors  retirement plan sponsors  broker dealers  major fund marketplaces and bank trust departments 
through our affiliates  we offer more than investment products across more than different investment styles in the institutional distribution channel  including small  small mid  mid and large capitalization value and growth equity and emerging markets 
in addition  our affiliates offer quantitative  alternative and fixed income products 
through this distribution channel  our affiliates manage assets for foundations and endowments  defined benefit and defined contribution plans for corporations and municipalities  and taft hartley plans  with disciplined and focused investment styles that address the specialized needs of institutional clients 
the high net worth distribution channel is comprised broadly of two principal client groups 
the first group consists principally of direct relationships with ultra high net worth and affluent individuals and families and charitable foundations 
for these clients  our affiliates provide investment management or customized investment counseling and fiduciary services 
the second group consists of individual managed account client relationships established through intermediaries  generally brokerage firms or other sponsors 
our affiliates provide investment management services through more than managed account programs 
in january  we completed the formation of managers investment group  llc managers or managers investment group  the successor to the managers funds llc  a distribution platform designed to expand our affiliates product offerings and distribution capabilities by leveraging our product development  packaging  sales and support expertise 
managers operates as a single point of contact for retail intermediaries  offering more than affiliate products to mutual fund and separate account investors through banks  brokerage firms  insurance companies  and other sponsored platforms such as defined contribution plans 
managers has offices located throughout the united states  and is supported by one of the largest marketing and wholesaling teams in the industry  which includes a significant external and internal sales force dedicated to providing sales and client services support 
while we operate our business through our affiliates in our three principal distribution channels  we strive to maintain each affiliate s distinct entrepreneurial culture and independence through our investment structure 
our principal investment structure involves the ownership of a majority interest in our affiliates  with each affiliate organized as a separate firm 
each affiliate operating agreement is tailored to meet that affiliate s particular characteristics and to enable us to cause or prevent certain actions to protect our interests 
we have revenue sharing arrangements with most of our affiliates 
under these arrangements  a percentage of revenue or in certain cases different percentages relating to the various sources or amounts of revenue of a particular affiliate is allocated for use by management of that affiliate in paying operating expenses of the affiliate  including salaries and bonuses 
we call this the operating allocation 
the portion of the affiliate s revenue that is allocated to the owners of that affiliate including us is called the owners allocation 
each affiliate allocates its owners allocation to its managers and to us generally in proportion to their and our respective ownership interests in that affiliate 
where we hold a minority equity interest  our revenue sharing arrangement does not include an operating allocation or owners allocation 
in these cases  we are generally allocated a percentage of the affiliate s revenue with the balance to be used to pay operating expenses and profit distributions to the other owners 
we agree to a particular revenue sharing arrangement if we believe that the operating allocation will cover operating expenses of the affiliate  including in the event of a potential increase in expenses or a decrease in revenue without a corresponding decrease in operating expenses 
to the extent that we are unable to anticipate changes in the revenue and expense base of an affiliate  the agreed upon operating allocation may not be large enough to pay for all of the affiliate s operating expenses 
the allocations and distributions of cash to us under the owners allocation generally have priority over the allocations and distributions to the affiliate s managers  which helps to protect us if there are any expenses in excess of the operating allocation of the affiliate 
thus  if an affiliate s expenses exceed its operating allocation  the excess expenses first reduce the portion of the owners allocation allocated to the affiliate s managers until that portion is eliminated  and then reduce the portion allocated to us 
any such reduction in our portion of the owners allocation is required to be paid back to us out of the portion of future owners allocation allocated to the affiliate s managers 
nevertheless  we may agree to adjustments to revenue sharing arrangements to accommodate our business needs or those of our affiliates  including deferring or foregoing the receipt of some portion or all of our share of an affiliate s revenue to permit the affiliate to fund operating expenses or restructuring our relationship with an affiliate  if we believe that doing so will maximize the long term benefits to us 
in addition  a revenue sharing arrangement may be modified to a profit based arrangement as described below to accommodate better our business needs or those of our affiliates 
one of the purposes of our revenue sharing arrangements is to provide ongoing incentives for affiliate managers by allowing them to participate in the growth of their firm s revenue  which may increase their compensation from the operating allocation and their distributions from the owners allocation  and to control operating expenses  thereby increasing the portion of the operating allocation that is available for growth initiatives and compensation 
for the year ended december   approximately million was reported as compensation to our affiliate managers 
additionally  during this period we allocated approximately million of our affiliates profits to their managers referred to on our income statement as minority interest 
some of our affiliates are not subject to a revenue sharing arrangement  but instead operate on a profit based model similar to a wholly owned subsidiary 
in our profit based affiliates  we participate in a budgeting process with the affiliate and receive as cash flow a share of its profits 
as a result  we participate fully in any increase or decrease in the revenue or expenses of such firms 
in these cases  we generally provide incentives to management through compensation arrangements based on the performance of the affiliate 
in recent periods  approximately of our earnings has been generated through our profit based arrangements 
net income on our income statement reflects the revenue of our majority owned affiliates and our share of income from affiliates in which we own a minority equity interest  reduced by the operating expenses of our majority owned affiliates  our operating expenses ie  our holding company expenses  including interest  amortization  income taxes and compensation for our employees  and the profits allocated to managers of our majority owned affiliates ie minority interest 
as discussed above  for affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  the operating expenses of the affiliate as well as its managers minority interest generally increase or decrease as the affiliate s revenue increases or decreases because of the direct relationship established in many of our agreements between the affiliate s revenue and its operating allocation and owners allocation 
at our profit based affiliates  expenses may or may not correspond to increases or decreases in the affiliates revenues 
our level of profitability will depend on a variety of factors  including those affecting the financial markets generally and the equity markets particularly  which could potentially result in considerable increases or decreases in the assets under management at our affiliates  the level of affiliate revenue  which is dependent on the ability of our existing and future affiliates to maintain or increase assets under management by maintaining their existing investment advisory relationships and fee structures  marketing their services successfully to new clients and obtaining favorable investment results  our receipt of owners allocation from affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  which depends on the ability of our existing and future affiliates to maintain certain levels of operating profit margins  the increases or decreases in the revenue and expenses of affiliates that operate on a profit based model  the availability and cost of the capital with which we finance our existing and new investments  our success in making new investments and the terms upon which such transactions are completed  the level of intangible assets and the associated amortization expense resulting from our investments  the level of expenses incurred for holding company operations  including compensation for our employees  and the level of taxation to which we are subject 
through our affiliated investment management firms  we derive most of our revenue from the provision of investment management services 
investment management fees asset based fees are usually determined as a percentage fee charged on periodic values of a client s assets under management and most asset based advisory fees are billed by our affiliates quarterly 
certain clients are billed for all or a portion of their accounts based upon assets under management valued at the beginning of a billing period in advance 
other clients are billed for all or a portion of their accounts based upon assets under management valued at the end of the billing period in arrears 
for example  most client accounts in the high net worth distribution channel are billed in advance  and most client accounts in the institutional distribution channel are billed in arrears 
clients in the mutual fund distribution channel are billed based upon average daily assets under management 
advisory fees billed in advance will not reflect subsequent changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
conversely  advisory fees billed in arrears will reflect changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
in addition  in the high net worth and institutional distribution channels  certain clients are billed on the basis of investment performance performance fees 
performance fees are inherently dependent on investment results and therefore may vary substantially from year to year 
principally  our assets under management are directly managed by our affiliates 
one of our affiliates also manages assets in the institutional distribution channel using an overlay strategy 
overlay assets assets that are managed subject to strategies which employ futures  options or other derivative securities generate asset based fees that are typically substantially lower than the asset based fees generated by our affiliates other investment strategies 
therefore  changes in directly managed assets generally have a greater impact on our revenue from asset based fees than changes in total assets under management a figure which includes overlay assets 
in addition to the revenue derived from providing investment management services  we derive a small portion of our revenue from transaction based brokerage fees and distribution fees at certain affiliates 
in the case of the transaction based brokerage business at third avenue management llc third avenue  our percentage participation in third avenue s brokerage fee revenue is substantially less than our percentage participation in the investment management fee revenue realized by third avenue and our other affiliates 
for this reason  increases or decreases in our consolidated revenue that are attributable to third avenue brokerage fees will not affect our earnings in the same manner as investment management services revenue from third avenue and our other affiliates 
results of operations the following tables present our affiliates reported assets under management by operating segment which are also referred to as distribution channels in this annual report on form k and a statement of changes for each period 
at december  assets under management operating segment dollars in billions mutual fund institutional high net worth directly managed assets percent of total overlay assets percent of total year ended december  assets under management statement of changes dollars in billions beginning of period new investments sale of affiliate equity investment net client cash flows directly managed assets net client cash flows overlay assets investment performance end of period we closed new affiliate investments in third avenue in august  genesis fund managers  llp in june and timessquare capital management  llc and aqr capital management  llc in november additionally  we acquired the retail mutual fund business conseco capital management  inc through managers investment group  llc in march in the second quarter of  we sold our minority equity interest in paradigm asset management  llc the operating segment analysis presented in the following table is based on average assets under management 
for the mutual fund distribution channel  average assets under management represents an average of the daily net assets under management 
for the institutional and high net worth distribution channels  average assets under management represents an average of the assets at the beginning and end of each calendar quarter during the applicable period 
we believe that this analysis more closely correlates to the billing cycle of each distribution channel and  as such  provides a more meaningful relationship to revenue 
change change in millions  except as noted average assets under management in billions mutual fund institutional high net worth total revenue mutual fund institutional high net worth total net income mutual fund institutional high net worth total ebitda mutual fund institutional high net worth total assets under management attributable to investments that closed during the relevant periods are included on a weighted average basis for the period from the closing date of the respective investment 
average assets under management includes assets managed by affiliated investment management firms that we do not consolidate for financial reporting purposes of billion  billion and billion for  and  respectively 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the basis of presentation of the financial results of our three operating segments 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are required to use the equity method of accounting for our investment in aqr and as such do not consolidate their revenue for financial reporting purposes 
our share of aqr s profits is reported in investment and other income and is therefore reflected in net income and ebitda 
the definition of ebitda and our reasons for using ebitda are presented in note on page our use of ebitda  including a reconciliation to cash flow from operations  is discussed in greater detail in liquidity and capital resources below 
revenue our revenue is generally determined by the following factors our assets under management including increases or decreases relating to new investments  net client cash flows or changes in the value of assets that are attributable to fluctuations in the equity markets  the portion of our assets across the three operating segments and our affiliates  which realize different fee rates  the portion of our directly managed and overlay assets  which realize different fee rates  the recognition of any performance fees  and the level of transaction based brokerage fees 
in addition  the billing patterns of our affiliates will have an impact on revenue in cases of rising or falling markets 
as described previously  advisory fees billed in advance will not reflect subsequent changes in the market value of assets under management for that period  while advisory fees billed in arrears will reflect changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
as a consequence  when equity market declines result in decreased assets under management in a particular period  revenue reported on accounts that are billed in advance of that period may appear to have a relatively higher quarterly fee rate  and in the case of equity market appreciation  revenue reported on accounts that are billed in advance of that period may appear to have a relatively lower quarterly fee rate 
the increase in revenue of million or in from resulted principally from a increase in average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management was primarily attributable to positive investment performance and  to a lesser extent  our new investments in unrelated to the change in assets under management  the increase in revenue was also a result of higher performance fees in as compared to the increase in revenue of million or in from resulted principally from a increase in average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management was primarily attributable to our investment in third avenue  which closed in the third quarter of and is included in our operating results for a full year in unrelated to the change in assets under management  the increase was partially offset by lower performance fees in as compared to the following discusses the changes in our revenue by operating segments 
mutual fund distribution channel the increase in revenue of million or in the mutual fund distribution channel in from resulted principally from a increase in average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management was primarily attributable to positive investment performance and  to a lesser extent  positive net client cash flows 
the increase in revenue was proportionately less than the growth in average assets under management because of an increase in assets under management that realize a comparatively lower fee rate 
the increase in revenue of million or in from resulted principally from a increase in average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management was primarily attributable to our investment in third avenue in the third quarter of and  to a lesser extent  positive net client cash flows 
the increase in revenue was proportionately less than the growth in average assets under management because of an increase in assets under management that realize a comparatively lower fee rate 
institutional distribution channel the increase in revenue of million or in the institutional distribution channel in from resulted principally from a increase in average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management was primarily attributable to positive investment performance and  to a lesser extent  our investments in new affiliates and positive net client cash flows 
the increase in revenue was proportionately greater than the growth in assets under management because of an increase in assets under management that realize a comparatively higher fee rate  as well as higher performance fees in revenue decreased by million or in from despite a increase in average assets under management 
lower performance fees in as compared to which are unrelated to changes in assets under management was the primary reason for the decline in revenue 
high net worth distribution channel the increase in revenue of million or in the high net worth distribution channel in from resulted principally from a increase in average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management was primarily attributable to positive investment performance and was partially offset by net client cash outflows  primarily at rorer asset management  llc 
the increase in revenue was proportionately greater than the growth in assets under management because of an increase in assets under management that realize a comparatively higher fee rate 
the decrease in revenue of million or in from resulted principally from a decline in average assets under management 
the decrease in average assets under management was primarily attributable to the decline in the equity markets in through the first quarter of  as well as net client cash outflows 
this decrease in revenue was partially offset by our investment in third avenue in the third quarter of operating expenses the following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses change change dollars in millions compensation and related expenses selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets depreciation and other amortization other operating expenses total operating expenses the substantial portion of our operating expenses is incurred by our affiliates  and the substantial majority of affiliate expenses is incurred at affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements 
for affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  an affiliate s operating allocation percentage generally determines its operating expenses 
most notably  our compensation expenses are generally impacted by increases or decreases in each affiliate s revenue and therefore by corresponding increases or decreases in their respective aggregate operating allocations 
during the year ended december   approximately million  or about of our consolidated compensation expense  was attributable to compensation allocated to our affiliate managers 
as described previously  the percentage of revenue allocated to operating expenses varies from one affiliate to another and can vary within an affiliate depending on the source or amounts of revenue 
as a result  changes in our aggregate revenue may not impact our consolidated operating expenses to the same degree 
in contrast  at our profit based affiliates  we participate fully in any increase or decrease in revenue and expenses 
compensation and related expenses increased in  following a increase in the increase in was primarily a result of the relationship between revenue and operating expenses at our affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  which experienced aggregate increases in revenue  and accordingly  reported higher compensation expenses 
the increase was also related to million in aggregate affiliate expenses from our new investments in and the inclusion of the compensation expense for those affiliates as well as higher holding company compensation 
the increase in resulted primarily from a million increase in aggregate affiliate expenses from our investment in third avenue in and the inclusion of compensation expense at third avenue in our operating results for the full year of  and was partially offset by a decrease in compensation expenses of million at the holding company and our other affiliates 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in the increase was principally attributable to an million increase in sub advisory and distribution expenses resulting from the growth in assets under management at our affiliates in the mutual fund distribution channel 
also contributing to the increase were million in aggregate affiliate expenses from our new investments in and the inclusion of the additional expenses for those affiliates and million of professional fees associated with our sarbanes oxley act compliance and new investment activities at the holding company 
selling  general and administrative expenses were flat in as the increase of million of selling  general and administrative expenses at third avenue for the inclusion of a full year of their expenses in was offset by a similar decrease in operating expenses at other affiliates 
amortization of intangible assets increased in the increase in amortization expense was equally attributable to amortization relating to investments in new and existing affiliates and changes in the remaining useful lives of our existing acquired client relationships which increased amortization expense 
the increase in amortization of intangible assets of in resulted from the inclusion of million of amortization expense for third avenue and changes in the remaining useful lives of our existing acquired client relationships 
depreciation and other amortization expenses increased in and in the increases in both years were principally attributable to new investments and other fixed asset purchases at the holding company and other affiliates 
other operating expenses increased in  principally as a result of a million increase in occupancy costs and other expenses reported by new affiliates in and the inclusion of these expenses for those affiliates  as well as a million one time expense associated with an affiliate lease termination 
other operating expenses were flat in  as the effect of a full year of operating expenses associated with our investment in third avenue which increased other operating expenses by million was offset by lower expenses at other affiliates 
other income statement data the following table summarizes other income statement data 
change change dollars in millions investment and other income minority interest interest expense income tax expense investment and other income primarily consists of the following our share of income from affiliates in which we own a minority equity interest  net of any related intangible amortization  earnings on cash and cash equivalent balances  and earnings that affiliates realize on any investments in accordance with our affiliate operating agreements  these earnings are generally allocated to our management partners and accordingly result in an increase in minority interest expense on our statement of operations 
investment and other income increased in  following a increase in the increase in was attributable to a million increase in affiliate earnings on investments  million of income attributable to our investment in aqr and a million increase in holding company interest income 
these increases were partially offset by a loss of million on our repurchase of million of the senior notes component of our prides in august as discussed below 
the increase in investment and other income in was primarily attributable to a one time gain of approximately million attributable to an affiliate s strategic alliance and a million increase in affiliate earnings on investments 
additionally  the increase was related to an increase of million in holding company interest income from elevated cash holdings following our issuance of floating rate senior convertible securities in and a one time gain of million from our repurchase of zero coupon senior convertible notes in minority interest increased in  principally as a result of the previously discussed increase in revenue 
during these periods  the percentage increase in minority interest was proportionately greater than the percentage increase in revenue because of an increase in revenue at profit based affiliates which  as discussed above  do not necessarily result in proportionate changes in minority interest 
minority interest was flat in  as the million increase in minority interest expense resulting from our investment in third avenue in was offset by a decrease of million resulting primarily from a decrease in revenue and an increase in investment spending of million at certain of our affiliates 
interest expense increased by million or in  following a decrease in the increase in was principally attributable to million of interest expense in connection with our issuance of our prides as discussed below 
this increase was offset by a million decrease in interest expense related to our repurchase of million of the senior notes component of our prides in august the decrease in interest expense in was attributable to expenses that did not recur in million of debt issuance cost amortization and million of interest rate derivative contracts settlements 
the decreases in were partially offset by interest expense attributable to our floating rate senior convertible securities issued in february the increase in income tax expense in was principally attributable to an increase in income before taxes and was partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate 
the increase in income tax expense in was principally attributable to an increase in income before taxes 
net income the following table summarizes net income for the past three years change change dollars in millions net income net income increased in  principally as a result of the increases in revenue  partially offset by increases in reported operating  interest  minority interest and tax expenses  as described above 
the increase in net income in resulted primarily from increases in revenue and investment and other income and lower interest expense  offset partially by the increases in operating and income tax expenses  as described above 
net income by segment is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
supplemental performance measure as supplemental information  we provide a non gaap performance measure that we refer to as cash net income 
this measure is provided in addition to  but not as a substitute for  net income 
cash net income is defined as net income plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets plus affiliate depreciation 
we consider cash net income an important measure of our financial performance  as we believe it best represents operating performance before non cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our affiliates 
cash net income is used by our management and board of directors as a principal performance benchmark  including as a measure for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value 
since our acquired assets do not generally depreciate or require replacement by us  and since they generate deferred tax expenses that are unlikely to reverse  we add back these non cash expenses to net income to measure operating performance 
we add back amortization attributable to acquired client relationships because this expense does not correspond to the changes in value of these assets  which do not diminish predictably over time 
the portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets including goodwill that we no longer amortize but which continues to generate tax deductions is added back  because these accruals would be used only in the event of a future sale of an affiliate or an impairment charge  which we consider unlikely 
we add back the portion of consolidated depreciation expense incurred by our affiliates because under our affiliates operating agreements we are generally not required to replenish these depreciating assets 
conversely  we do not add back the deferred taxes relating to our floating rate senior convertible securities or other depreciation expenses 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net income to cash net income dollars in millions net income intangible amortization intangible amortization equity method investments intangible related deferred taxes affiliate depreciation cash net income in  we modified the definition of cash net income to clarify that deferred taxes relating to our issuance of convertible securities and certain depreciation are not added back for the calculation of cash net income 
if we had used this definition of cash net income beginning in  cash net income for would have been million 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are required to use the equity method of accounting for our investment in aqr and as such do not consolidate their revenue or expenses  including intangible amortization expenses  in our income statement 
our share of aqr s amortization is reported in investment and other income 
cash net income increased in and in  primarily as a result of the previously described factors affecting net income 
liquidity and capital resources our capital structure includes a number of convertible instruments 
our zero coupon senior convertible notes and floating rate senior convertible securities are contingently convertible securities while our prides and previously  our prides are mandatory convertible securities 
our mandatory convertible securities are structured to issue additional equity at a pre determined future date 
our contingently convertible securities are structured to provide us with low cash interest payments and in the case of the zero coupon senior convertible notes  no cash interest payments  and in the case of the floating rate senior convertible securities  significant tax benefits 
we view our ratio of debt to ebitda our leverage ratio as an important gauge of our ability to service debt  make new investments and access capital 
consistent with industry practice  we do not consider our mandatory convertible security as debt for the purpose of determining our leverage ratio 
as more fully discussed below  each unit of our prides is comprised of a senior note and a forward purchase contract 
under the terms of the security  the exercise of the forward purchase contracts at the settlement date will result in the issuance of shares of our common stock that will generate cash proceeds sufficient to amortize debt in an amount equal to the remaining note portion of the security 
we also view our leverage on a net debt basis by deducting our cash and cash equivalents from our debt balance 
the leverage covenant of our senior bank facility is generally consistent with our treatment of the prides security and our net debt approach 
at december   our leverage ratio was the following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources december  dollars in millions balance sheet data cash and cash equivalents short term investments senior debt zero coupon convertible notes floating rate convertible securities mandatory convertible securities cash flow data operating cash flows investing cash flows financing cash flows ebitda the definition of ebitda is presented in note on page supplemental liquidity measure as supplemental information  we provide information regarding our ebitda  a non gaap liquidity measure 
this measure is provided in addition to  but not as a substitute for  cash flow from operations 
ebitda represents earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda  as calculated by us  may not be consistent with computations of ebitda by other companies 
as a measure of liquidity  we believe that ebitda is useful as an indicator of our ability to service debt  make new investments and meet working capital requirements 
we further believe that many investors use this information when analyzing the financial position of companies in the investment management industry 
the following table provides a reconciliation of cash flow from operations to ebitda dollars in millions cash flow from operations interest expense  net of non cash items current tax provision intangible amortization equity method investments changes in assets and liabilities and other adjustments ebitda as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are required to use the equity method of accounting for our investment in aqr and as such do not consolidate their revenue or expenses  including intangible amortization  in our income statement 
our share of aqr s amortization is reported in investment and other income 
in  we have met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities  the issuance of convertible debt securities and borrowings of senior debt 
our principal uses of cash were to make investments in new and existing affiliates  repurchase shares of our common stock  repurchase debt securities and make distributions to affiliate managers 
we expect that our principal uses of cash for the foreseeable future will be for investments in new and existing affiliates  distributions to affiliate managers  payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt  the repurchase of debt securities  the repurchase of shares of our common stock and for working capital purposes 
senior revolving credit facility in august  we amended our senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of major commercial banks  which previously allowed for borrowings of up to million 
the amended credit facility the facility extends the maturity date to august and currently provides that we may borrow up to million at rates of interest based either on the eurodollar rate or the prime rate as in effect from time to time that vary depending on our credit ratings 
subject to the agreement of the lenders or prospective lenders to increase their commitments  we have the option to increase the facility up to an aggregate of million 
the facility contains financial covenants with respect to net worth  leverage and interest coverage 
the facility also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on indebtedness  liens  cash dividends and fundamental corporate changes 
any borrowings under the facility would be collateralized by pledges of all capital stock or other equity interests owned by us 
at december   we had million outstanding under the facility 
zero coupon senior convertible notes in may  we completed a private placement of zero coupon senior convertible notes 
in this private placement  we sold an aggregate of million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon senior convertible notes due  with each note issued at of such principal amount and accreting at a rate of per year 
each security is convertible into shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain events  including the following i if the closing price of a share of our common stock is more than a specified price over certain periods initially and increasing incrementally at the end of each calendar quarter to in april  ii if the credit rating assigned by standard poor s to the securities is below bb  or iii if we call the securities for redemption 
the holders may require us to repurchase the securities at their accreted value in may  and if the holders exercise this option in the future  we may elect to repurchase the securities with cash  shares of our common stock or some combination thereof 
we have the option to redeem the securities for cash on or after may  at their accreted value 
in  we repurchased an aggregate million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon senior convertible notes in privately negotiated transactions and realized a gain of million  which was reported in investment and other income 
under the terms of the indenture governing the zero coupon senior convertible notes  through march  a holder may convert such security into our common stock by following the conversion procedures in the indenture  the zero coupon senior convertible notes may cease to be convertible in the future 
floating rate senior convertible securities in february  we completed a private placement of million of floating rate senior convertible securities due floating rate convertible securities 
the floating rate convertible securities bear interest at a rate equal to month libor minus  payable in cash quarterly 
each security is convertible into shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain events  including the following i if the closing price of a share of our common stock exceeds over certain periods  ii if the credit rating assigned by standard poor s is below bb  or iii if we call the securities for redemption 
upon conversion  holders of the securities will receive shares of our common stock for each convertible security 
in addition  if the market price of our common stock exceeds per share at the time of conversion  holders will receive additional shares of common stock based on the stock price at that time 
based on the trading price of our common stock as of december   upon conversion a holder of each security would receive an additional shares 
the holders of the floating rate convertible securities may require us to repurchase such securities in february    and  at their principal amount 
we may choose to pay the purchase price for such repurchases with cash  shares of our common stock or some combination thereof 
we may redeem the convertible securities for cash at any time on or after february   at their principal amount 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to exchange a fixed rate for the variable rate on million of our floating rate senior convertible securities 
for the period february through february  we will pay a weighted average fixed rate of on that notional amount 
the floating rate senior convertible securities are considered contingent payment debt instruments under federal income tax regulations 
these regulations require us to deduct interest expense at the rate at which we would issue a non contingent  non convertible  fixed rate debt instrument 
when the implied interest rate for tax purposes is greater than the actual interest rate  a deferred tax expense is generated 
while the implied interest rate for these securities for tax purposes is  the actual rate is three month libor minus as of march   this rate equaled 
based on current libor rates  these securities generate approximately million of deferred taxes each year 
while these deferred tax liabilities may never reverse  such liabilities will reverse if we redeem the securities on february  or later and if our common stock is trading at per share or less on the date of redemption 
all deferred taxes related to the securities will be reclassified to equity if the securities convert and our common stock is trading at more than per share when it is delivered to holders 
senior notes due in december  we completed a public offering of mandatory convertible securities prides 
a sale of an over allotment of the securities was completed in january  increasing the aggregate amount outstanding to million 
each unit of the prides initially consisted of i a senior note due november  with a principal amount of per note  on which we pay quarterly interest  and ii a forward purchase contract pursuant to which the holder agreed to purchase shares of our common stock on november   with the number of shares to be determined based upon the average trading price of our common stock for a period preceding that date 
in august  we repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of the senior notes component of the prides 
we repurchased the notes through a tender offer  a privately negotiated purchase and certain repurchases in the august remarketing of the notes 
we reported a loss of million on our repurchase of these notes  which was reported in investment and other income 
in august  we also settled million of the prides forward purchase contracts and realized a gain of million  which was recorded directly to stockholders equity 
in connection with the settlement of the forward purchase contracts in november  we issued million shares of common stock and received million of gross proceeds 
following these transactions  million in aggregate principal amount of the senior notes component of the prides the senior notes due remain outstanding  with an interest rate of and a maturity date of november mandatory convertible securities in february  we completed a private placement of million of mandatory convertible securities prides 
as described below  these securities are structured to provide million of additional proceeds to us following a successful remarketing and the exercise of forward purchase contracts in february each unit of the prides consists of i a senior note due february with a principal amount of  per note  on which we pay interest quarterly at the annual rate of  and ii a forward purchase contract pursuant to which the holder has agreed to purchase shares of our common stock in february holders of the purchase contracts receive a quarterly contract adjustment payment at the annual rate of per  purchase contract 
the current portion of the contract adjustment payments  approximately million  is recorded in current liabilities 
the number of shares to be issued in february will be determined based upon the average trading price of our common stock for a period preceding that date 
depending on the average trading price in that period  the settlement rate will range from to shares per  purchase contract 
based on the trading price of the company s common stock as of december   the purchase contracts would have a settlement rate of each of the senior notes is pledged to us to collateralize the holder s obligations under the forward purchase contracts 
beginning in august  under the terms of the prides  the senior notes are expected to be remarketed to new investors 
a successful remarketing will generate million of gross proceeds to be used by the original holders of the prides to honor their obligations on the forward purchase contracts 
in exchange for the additional million in payment on the forward purchase contracts  we will issue shares of our common stock to the original holders of the senior notes 
as referenced above  the number of shares of common stock to be issued will be determined by the market price of our common stock at that time 
assuming a successful remarketing  the senior notes will remain outstanding until at least february forward equity sale agreement in october  we entered into a forward equity sale agreement with a major securities firm 
under the terms of the agreement  we can elect to deliver a specified number of shares of common stock at any time until october  in exchange for proceeds of approximately million 
alternatively  we can cancel the transaction at any time 
upon cancellation  we may net settle the forward agreement in stock  cash  or a combination thereof 
under certain circumstances  we can be required to settle the forward equity sale agreement by delivering shares of common stock 
we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock until settlement of all or a portion of the forward equity sale agreement 
in connection with this agreement  our counterparty borrowed approximately million shares of our common stock in the stock loan market and sold these shares pursuant to our existing shelf registration statement 
purchases of affiliate equity our affiliate operating agreements provide our affiliate managers the conditional right to require us to purchase their retained equity interests at certain intervals 
the agreements also provide us a conditional right to require affiliate managers to sell their retained equity interests to us upon their death  permanent incapacity or termination of employment and provide affiliate managers a conditional right to require us to purchase such retained equity interests upon the occurrence of specified events 
these purchases may occur in varying amounts over a period of approximately years or longer  and the actual timing and amounts of such purchases or the actual occurrence of such purchases generally cannot be predicted with any certainty 
these purchases are generally calculated based upon a multiple of the affiliate s cash flow distributions  which is intended to represent fair value 
as one measure of the potential magnitude of such purchases  in the event that a triggering event and resulting purchase occurred with respect to all such retained equity interests as of december   the aggregate amount of these payments would have totaled approximately million 
in the event that all such transactions were closed  we would own the prospective cash flow distributions of all equity interests that would be purchased from our affiliate managers 
as of december   this amount would represent approximately million on an annualized basis 
we pay for these purchases in cash  shares of our common stock or other forms of consideration 
with our approval  affiliate managers are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities  subject to certain restrictions 
these potential purchases  combined with our other cash needs  may require more cash than is available from operations  and therefore  we may need to raise capital by making borrowings under our facility  by selling shares of our common stock or other equity or debt securities  or to otherwise refinance a portion of these purchases 
operating cash flow cash flow from operations generally represents net income plus non cash charges for amortization  deferred taxes and depreciation as well as the changes from our consolidated working capital 
the increase in cash flow from operations in from resulted principally from increases in net income and minority interest which resulted from growth in revenue reported in from the decrease in cash flow from operations in from resulted principally from increases in receivables at december  from december  as a result of the growth in revenue reported in the fourth quarter of investing cash flow changes in net cash flow from investing activities result primarily from our investments in new and existing affiliates 
net cash flow used to make investments was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  we acquired a majority equity interest in third avenue and additional equity interests in existing affiliates 
in  we made payments to acquire additional equity interests in existing affiliates 
in  we acquired equity interests in genesis  timessquare and aqr  and an additional equity interest in friess associates  as well as additional equity interests in other existing affiliates 
financing cash flow the increase in net cash flow from financing activities in from was attributable to our issuance of million of equity related to our prides and greater borrowings under our facility  and was partially offset by million of stock repurchases associated with the issuance of our prides 
the increase in net cash flow from financing activities in from was attributable to our issuance of the floating rate senior convertible securities in february the principal sources of cash from financing activities during and were borrowings under our facility and the issuances of convertible debt securities  respectively 
in  our uses of cash from financing activities were to repurchase million of principal amount at maturity of the zero coupon senior convertible securities  repurchase shares of our common stock and repay debt 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share under share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors 
a share repurchase program was authorized by the board of directors in april  permitting us to repurchase up to of our common stock 
in july and april  our board of directors approved increases to the existing share repurchase program  in each case authorizing the purchase of up to an additional of our common stock 
our board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program in connection with our prides  permitting us to repurchase up to an additional million shares of our outstanding common stock at the time of the closing of the prides and an additional million shares of common stock through february the timing and amount of purchases under the repurchase programs are determined at the discretion of our management 
at march   approximately million shares of common stock remained authorized for repurchase under the share repurchase programs 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due contractual obligations total thereafter dollars in millions senior debt senior convertible debt mandatory convertible securities purchases of affiliate equity leases other liabilities total   as more fully discussed on page  consistent with industry practice  we do not consider our mandatory convertible securities as debt for the purpose of determining our leverage ratio 
under the terms of our mandatory convertible securities  the exercise of the forward purchase contract component at the settlement date will result in the issuance of shares of our common stock and will generate cash proceeds to amortize debt in an amount equal to the remaining note portion of the securities 
purchases of affiliate equity reflect estimates of our conditional purchases of additional equity in our affiliates and assume that all conditions to such purchases are met and that such purchases will all be effected on the date that they are first exercisable 
as described previously  these purchases may occur in varying amounts over the next years or longer  and the actual timing and amounts of such purchases or the actual occurrence of such purchases generally cannot be predicted with any certainty 
additionally  in many instances we have the discretion to settle these purchases with our common stock and in all cases can consent to the transfer of these interests to other individuals or entities 
as one measure of the potential magnitude of such purchases  assuming that all such purchases had been effected as of december   the aggregate purchase amount would have totaled approximately million 
assuming the closing of such additional purchases  we would own the prospective cash flow distributions associated with all additional equity so purchased  estimated to be approximately million on an annualized basis as of december  other liabilities reflect amounts payable to affiliate managers related to our purchase of additional affiliate equity interests 
interest rate sensitivity our revenue is derived primarily from fees which are based on the values of assets managed 
such values are affected by changes in the broader financial markets which are  in part  affected by changing interest rates 
we cannot predict the effects that interest rates or changes in interest rates may have on either the broader financial markets or our affiliates assets under management and associated fees 
we pay variable rates of interest on our floating rate senior convertible securities  and accordingly changing interest rates will affect the interest expense associated with these securities 
we estimate that a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  would result in a net increase in the interest expense related to our variable rate financings of approximately million 
from time to time  we seek to offset such interest rate exposure by entering into hedging contracts 
we pay fixed rates of interest on the senior notes component of our prides and our senior notes due while a change in market interest rates would not affect the interest expense incurred on these securities  such a change may affect the fair value of these securities 
we estimate that a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  would result in a net decrease in the fair value of our securities of approximately million at december  market risk from time to time  we seek to offset our exposure to changing interest rates under our debt financing arrangements by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
as of december   we were a party  with three major commercial banks as counterparties  to million notional amount interest rate swap contracts which fix the interest rate on the notional amount to a weighted average interest rate of approximately for the period from february to february the unrealized loss on these interest rate swap contracts as of december  was million 
we estimate that a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  would result in a net increase in the unrealized value of approximately million 
there can be no assurance that our hedging contracts will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense or that we will be successful in obtaining hedging contracts in the future on our existing or any new indebtedness 
recent accounting developments emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share became effective in the fourth quarter of eitf states that any shares of common stock that may be issued to settle contingently convertible securities such as the shares that underlie our zero coupon senior convertible notes and floating rate senior convertible securities must be considered issued in the calculation of diluted earnings per share  regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent feature in these securities has been met 
this is commonly referred to as the if converted method 
eitf requires the retroactive application to earnings per share measurements for all prior periods presented 
the retroactive application of eitf had the impact of reducing earnings per share by  and in each of the years ending december   and  respectively 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas r  requiring the measurement of the cost of all employee share based payments including stock option awards in financial statements using a fair value based method 
we are required to adopt fas r in the third quarter of fiscal using a prospective application of the standard  compensation cost will be recognized on or after the effective date for the portion of all outstanding awards for which the required service has not yet been rendered 
compensation cost will be based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
although we continue to assess the impact of the adoption of fas r  we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or earnings per share 
in november  the eitf reached a tentative conclusion on eitf issue no 
eitf  investor s accounting for an investment in a limited partnership when the investor is the sole general partner and the limited partners have certain rights 
the tentative conclusion provides a framework for addressing whether a sole general partner should consolidate a limited partnership 
the eitf acknowledged that the tentative conclusions reached in eitf conflict with certain aspects of statement of position accounting for investments in real estate ventures sop 
the eitf requested that the fasb consider amending the guidance in sop to be consistent with the tentative conclusions reached in eitf the fasb discussed this request at its meeting in november  and agreed to propose an amendment to sop to address that inconsistency 
depending on the outcome of the discussions of the eitf in future meetings  the outcome could impact whether or not our affiliates consolidate investment partnerships in which they hold a general partner interest 
critical accounting estimates and judgments the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting estimates and judgments 
these policies are affected significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
valuation in allocating the purchase price of our investments and testing our intangible assets for impairment  we make estimates and assumptions to determine the value of our acquired client relationships and operating segments 
we also assess the value of minority interests held by our affiliate managers in establishing the terms for their transfer 
in these valuations  we make assumptions of the growth rates and useful lives of existing and prospective client accounts 
additionally  we make assumptions of  among other factors  valuation multiples  tax benefits and discount rates 
in certain instances  we engage third party consultants to perform independent evaluations 
the impact of many of these assumptions are material to our financial condition and operating performance and  at times  are subjective 
if we used different assumptions  our intangible assets and related amortization could be stated differently and our impairment conclusions could be modified 
additionally  the use of different assumptions to value our minority interests could change the amount of compensation expense  if any  we report upon their transfer 
intangible assets at december   the carrying amounts of our intangible asset balances are as follows dollars in millions definite lived acquired client relationships indefinite lived acquired client relationships goodwill these amounts exclude balances attributable to equity method investments 
we amortize our definite lived acquired client relationships over their expected useful lives 
we reassess these lives each quarter based on historical attrition rates and other events and circumstances that may in the future influence these rates 
significant judgment is required to estimate the period that these assets will contribute to our cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed 
a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the amount of our amortization expense 
for example  if we reduced the weighted average remaining life of our definite lived acquired client relationships by one year  our amortization expense would increase by approximately million per year 
we assess each of our definite lived acquired client relationship for impairment at least annually by comparing their carrying value to their projected undiscounted cash flows 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our most recent annual impairment test  and no impairment was identified 
we do not amortize our indefinite lived acquired client relationships because we expect these contracts will contribute to our cash flows indefinitely 
each quarter  we assess whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate these relationships might have a definite life 
we test the carrying amount of each of our indefinite lived acquired client relationships at least annually  or at such time that we conclude the assets no longer have an indefinite life by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to its fair value 
we derive the fair value of each of our indefinite lived acquired client relationships primarily based on discounted cash flow analysis 
our valuation analysis reflects assumptions of the growth of the assets  discount rates and other factors 
changes in the estimates used in these valuations could materially affect the impairment conclusion 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our most recent annual impairment test and no impairment was identified 
we test the carrying amount of the goodwill in each of our three operating segments at least annually by comparing their carrying amount to an estimate of fair value 
we establish the fair value of each of our operating segments primarily based on price earnings multiples 
changes in the estimates used in this test could materially affect our impairment conclusion 
in the third quarter of  we performed our most recent annual impairment test and no impairment was identified 
deferred taxes our deferred tax liabilities are generated from tax deductible intangible assets and  to a lesser extent  from our floating rate convertible securities 
as more fully described below  we generally believe that our intangible related deferred taxes which totaled approximately million in are unlikely to reverse  and believe that the deferred tax liabilities for our floating rate convertible securities may not reverse 
as such  we currently believe the economic benefit we realize from these sources will be permanent 
our intangible assets are tax deductible because we generally structure our affiliate investments as cash transactions that are taxable to the sellers 
we record deferred taxes because a substantial majority of our intangible assets do not amortize for financial statement purposes  but do amortize for tax purposes  thereby creating tax deductions that reduce our current cash taxes 
these liabilities will reverse only in the event of a sale of an affiliate or an impairment charge  events we consider unlikely to occur 
under current accounting rules  we are required to accrue the estimated cost of such a reversal as a deferred tax liability 
as of december   our estimate of the tax liability associated with such a sale or impairment charge was approximately million 
our floating rate convertible securities also generate deferred tax liabilities because our interest deductions for tax purposes are greater than our interest expense for financial statement purposes 
as described in greater detail on page  if our stock price exceeds per share when the securities are converted  the cumulative tax savings realized in prior periods million at december  will be reclassified to equity 
as of december   our stock price was 
beginning in february  we have the right to redeem these securities  which could result in our realization of these benefits which totaled approximately million as of december  
in addition  we also regularly assess our deferred tax assets  which consist primarily of state credits and loss carryforwards  in order to determine the need for valuation allowances 
in our assessment we make assumptions about future taxable income that may be generated to utilize these assets  which have limited lives 
if we determine that we are unlikely to realize the benefit of a deferred tax asset  we would establish a valuation allowance that would increase our tax expense in the period of such determination 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance for all state tax credit and loss carry forwards 
changes in our tax position could have a material impact on our earnings 
for example  a increase to our statutory tax rate attributable to our deferred tax liabilities would result in an increase of approximately million in our tax expense in the period of such determination 
revenue recognition the majority of our consolidated revenue represents advisory fees asset based and performance based 
our affiliates recognize asset based advisory fees quarterly as they render services to their clients 
unlike asset based fees  which are calculated based upon a contractual percentage of a client s assets under management  performance based fees are generally assessed as a percentage of the investment performance realized on a client s account  generally over an annual period 
our affiliates recognize performance based fees only when the fee becomes billable and not in quarters before then 
economic and market conditions the asset management industry is an important segment of the financial services industry and has been a key driver of growth in financial services over the last decade 
as of the end of  according to the most recent available data  industry wide assets under management across the mutual fund  institutional and high net worth distribution channels totaled approximately trillion in the united states 
we believe prospects for overall industry growth estimated by a global securities firm to increase at a compound rate of to annually over the next five years remain strong 
we expect that this growth will be driven by market related increases in assets under management  broad demographic trends and wealth creation related to growth in gross domestic product  and will be experienced in varying degrees across all three of the principal distribution channels for our affiliates products mutual fund  institutional and high net worth 
in the mutual fund distribution channel  according to a industry report  more than million individuals in almost million households in the united states are invested in mutual funds 
in  net inflows to equity mutual funds totaled nearly billion  with aggregate mutual fund assets totaling trillion at the end of we anticipate that inflows to mutual funds will continue and that aggregate mutual fund assets  particularly those in equity mutual funds  will continue to increase in line with long term market growth 
assets in the institutional distribution channel are in retirement plans  as well as endowments and foundations  with total assets in the channel of approximately trillion at the end of net cash flows in to institutional products were approximately billion in  with the majority of these new investments made in equity products 
we anticipate that the combination of an aging work force and long term market growth should contribute to the ongoing strength of this distribution channel 
the high net worth distribution channel is comprised broadly of high net worth and affluent individuals  family trusts and managed accounts 
within this channel  ultra high net worth and high net worth families and individuals those having at least million in investable assets had aggregate assets of trillion at the end of  industry experts expect assets in this segment of the channel to grow to trillion by the end of we believe that affluent individuals those having between  and million in investable assets represent an important source of asset growth within the high net worth channel  as the number of such individuals and the amount of investable assets increases  and the popularity of separately managed account investment products for affluent individuals continues to grow 
according to a recent industry report  assets in separately managed accounts totaled approximately billion at the end of a nearly increase over year end and are expected to reach trillion by international operations genesis has offices in london  guernsey and chile 
tweedy  browne company llc  which is based in new york  maintains a research office in london 
dfd select group  sarl  a subsidiary of dfd select group limited in which we own a minority interest  is organized and headquartered in paris  france and first quadrant limited  an affiliate of first quadrant  lp  is organized and headquartered outside of london  england 
in the future  we may invest in other investment management firms which are located and or conduct a significant part of their operations outside of the united states 
there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  such as changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  difficulties in collecting investment advisory fees receivable  less stringent legal  regulatory and accounting regimes  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  expatriation controls  expropriation risks and potential adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our affiliated investment management firms that have international operations or on other investment management firms in which we may invest in the future and  consequently  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation or changing prices have had a material impact on our results of operations
