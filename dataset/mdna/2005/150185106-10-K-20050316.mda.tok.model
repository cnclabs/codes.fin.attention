item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business overview we generate our revenues primarily from sales of admission to our parks  food  merchandise and games inside our parks  and hotel rooms  food and other attractions outside our parks 
our principal costs and expenses  which include salaries and wages  advertising  maintenance  operating supplies  utilities and insurance  are relatively fixed and do not vary significantly with attendance 
the fixed nature of these costs makes attendance a key factor in the profitability of each park 
results of operations include geauga lake since its acquisition in april of the table below presents certain financial data expressed as a percent of total net revenues and selective statistical information for the periods indicated 
for the years ended december  in millions in millions in millions net revenues admissions food  merchandise and games accommodations and other net revenues cash operating costs and expenses adjusted ebitda depreciation and amortization other non cash costs operating income interest and other expense  net provision for taxes net income selective statistical information amusement park attendance in thousands amusement park per capita spending water park attendance in thousands water park per capita spending adjusted ebitda represents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and all other non cash costs 
adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of operating performance computed in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for operating income  net income or cash flows from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is a meaningful measure of park level operating profitability because we use it for measuring returns on capital investments  evaluating potential acquisitions  determining awards under incentive compensation plans  and calculating compliance with certain loan covenants 
adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to operating and net income the most comparable financial measures is provided in the table above 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make estimates and assumptions during the normal course of business that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note to our consolidated financial statements of a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
property and equipment buildings  rides and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis over each park s operating season 
expenditures made to maintain such assets in their original operating condition are expensed as incurred  and improvements and upgrades are capitalized 
the composite method of depreciation is used for groups of assets obtained together in an acquisition of a business 
self insurance reserves reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance 
these estimates are established based upon historical claims data and third party estimates of settlement costs for incurred claims 
these reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in these factors and adjustments are made as needed 
revenue recognition revenues on multi day admission tickets are recognized over the estimated number of visits expected for each type of ticket  and are adjusted at the end of each seasonal period 
all other revenues are recognized on a daily basis based on actual guest spending at our facilities  or over the park operating season in the case of certain marina dockage revenues 
results of operations vs 
net revenues in increased  or million  to million 
the increase in net revenues was the result of a increase in combined attendance across our properties to million from million in  a increase in average in park guest per capita spending to from in  and a increase in out of park revenues 
the increase in out of park revenues was primarily driven by improvement in occupancy levels at our resort hotels at cedar point 
excluding results from the acquisition of geauga lake  net revenues in would have increased  or million  on a decrease in combined attendance  a increase in average in park guest per capita spending  and a increase in out of park revenues 
in  the addition of geauga lake  along with a strong year at knott s berry farm  offset soft attendance numbers at some of our seasonal amusement parks resulting from inconsistent weather during the peak summer months and a moderate capital program 
good weather  together with favorable tourism and pricing trends in the southern california market  contributed to knott s strong performance 
for the year  combined attendance at our seven amusement parks totaled million guests  up from excluding the impact of geauga lake  combined attendance at our amusement parks would have decreased to million 
at our five water parks  the comparisons entering were very difficult following record performances at several of the parks in for the full year  combined attendance at our five water parks totaled million guests  down from  with the majority of that decrease coming at oceans of fun in kansas city  where temperatures stayed well below average al l summer long 
the increase in our average in park guest per capita spending level in was due to solid improvements in guest spending on admissions and foods  as well as a shift in the mix of attendance away from lower per capita parks  such as our water parks 
excluding depreciation and all other non cash charges  total operating costs and expenses in increased  or million  to million from million in this increase was largely due to the acquisition of geauga lake 
excluding operations at geauga lake  total cash operating costs and expenses for would have increased only  or million  from all operating costs as a percent of revenues remained relatively level between years 
because we strongly emphasize generating cash flow for distributions to our unitholders  a meaningful measure of our operating results is adjusted ebitda  which represents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and other non cash charges and credits 
in  adjusted ebitda decreased  or million  to million  due entirely to an adjusted ebitda loss of million generated at geauga lake during the period subsequent to its acquisition 
excluding the impact of geauga lake  adjusted ebitda would have increased  or million  to million in  due primarily to increases in average in park guest per capita spending and out of park revenues 
the consolidated adjusted ebitda margin in decreased to from in  due almost entirely to the impact of the geauga lake operations 
on a same park basis  the consolidated ebitda margin decreased only slightly to  due to soft attendance figures at our highest margin park  cedar point 
in  we began accounting for unit options using the fair value method under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in  we recorded a million non cash charge for unit options  compared to a charge of million in in  we recorded a million non cash charge related to the change in fair value of two of our interest rate swap agreements that could not be designated as effective hedges under the applicable accounting rules 
in  we recognized a non cash credit of million for the change in fair value of these swap agreements during the year  which compared to a non cash credit of million in these amounts are aggregated with interest expense in the accompanying table 
after these non cash items  and interest expense and provision for partnership taxes  both of which were up between years due to the geauga lake acquisition  net income for decreased million to million  or per diluted limited partner unit  from million  or per unit  in excluding the impact of geauga lake  net income for would have increased million between years to million  or per unit 
vs 
net revenues in increased  or million  to million from million in this increase reflects a increase in average in park guest per capita spending to from in  a increase in out of park revenues and a decrease in combined attendance across our properties to million from million in 
the increase in out of park revenues was from improvements in occupancy levels at our resort hotels at cedar point and knott s berry farm 
in  successful capital programs at cedar point and valleyfair  along with a record year at michigan s adventure  partially offset attendance declines at dorney park and worlds of fun resulting from poor weather and the lack of a major new attraction  and an attendance decline at knott s berry farm due to soft tourism trends and heavy competition 
for the year  combined attendance at our six amusement parks totaled million  down less than from s level 
at cedar point  the addition of top thrill dragster  the world s tallest and fastest roller coaster  contributed to the park s solid performance  while the introduction of the steel venom roller coaster at valleyfair helped generate record revenues at that park 
at our five water parks  improved attendance at our california properties  along with a record year at worlds of fun s water park  oceans of fun  led to a increase in combined attendance to million guests 
the increase in our overall in park guest per capita spending level in was due to solid improvements in guest spending on admissions and merchandise  as well as a shift in the mix of attendance toward higher per capita parks  such as cedar point 
cash operating costs and expenses  excluding depreciation and all other non cash charges  increased less than to million in from million in  due to a continued focus at the individual park level to control operating costs during the year 
all operating costs as a percent of revenues remained relatively level between years 
in  adjusted ebitda increased to a record million from million in  due primarily to increases in average in park guest per capita spending and out of park revenues  as well as each park s ability to control operating costs 
the consolidated adjusted ebitda margin improved to in from in  due to costs increasing at a slower rate than revenues 
other non cash costs in include a million charge for unit options under sfas no 
in  we recognized a non cash unit option charge of million under our previous policy of accounting for unit options using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as we marked to market our variable priced options only 
in addition  we recorded a provision of million for the estimated portion of the net book value of certain fixed assets that might not be recoverable after they were removed from service in after these non cash items  and interest expense and provision for partnership taxes  both of which were comparable between years except for the effect of interest rate swap accounting  net income for increased million to million  or per diluted limited partner unit  from million  or per unit  in liquidity and capital resources we ended in sound financial condition in terms of both liquidity and cash flow 
the negative working capital ratio current liabilities divided by current assets of at december  is the result of our highly seasonal business and careful management of cash flow to reduce borrowings 
receivables and inventories are at normally low seasonal levels and credit facilities are in place to fund current liabilities  capital expenditures and pre opening expenses as required 
operating activities net cash from operating activities increased million  or  to million in this increase was primarily due to normal fluctuations in current liabilities and accrued taxes  offset by a decrease in net income of million 
the acquisition of geauga lake  combined with the timing in payments of liabilities  contributed to the increase in current liabilities and accrued taxes 
investing activities investing activities consist principally of acquisitions and capital investments we make in our amusement parks and resort properties 
during  net cash used for investing activities totaled million  including million for the acquisition of geauga lake and million of capital expenditures  compared to million in the million increase between years in capital expenditures is the result of a moderate capital program for the season and the early timing of payments on several large capital projects for the season 
we also invested million in castaway bay  our year round indoor water park resort in sandusky  ohio  which opened to the public in november for the operating season  we are investing approximately million in capital improvements at our properties  including the addition of new world class roller coasters at knott s berry farm and dorney park  as well as the addition of a major new water park at geauga lake 
we are optimistic that these investments  as well as other improvements at each of the parks  will generate a high level of public interest and acceptance 
however  stable population trends in the parks market areas and uncontrollable factors  such as weather  the economy  and competition for leisure time and spending  preclude us from anticipating significant long term increases in attendance 
historically  we have been able to improve our revenues and profitability by continuing to make substantial investments in our parks and resort facilities 
this has enabled us to maintain consistently high attendance levels  as well as generate increases in guest per capita spending and revenues from guest accommodat ions  while carefully controlling operating and administrative expenses 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in  compared to net cash utilized of million and million in and  respectively 
in connection with our acquisition of geauga lake in april  we issued million of senior notes with terms of seven to eleven years at a fixed rate of  and we completed an equity offering of million limited partner units  which generated net proceeds of million 
in addition  net revolving credit borrowings totaled million in cash used in financing activities during the year reflects million for scheduled term loan repayments  million to pay cash distributions  and million to repurchase the former general partner s interest in the partnership 
capital resources at december   we had million of fixed rate term debt  with staggered maturities ranging from to  as well as a million revolving credit facility  which is available through march borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled million as of december  of the total term debt  million is scheduled to mature in based on interest rates in effect at yearend for variable rate debt  and after giving effect to interest rate swap agreements described below  cash interest payments for would total approximately million  in line with interest paid in in addition  cash distributions in  at the recently declared new annual rate of per unit  would total approximately million  higher than the distributions paid in credit facilities and cash flow from operations are expected to be adequate to meet planned capital expenditures  as well as seasonal working capital needs and regular quarterly cash distributions for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes certain obligations at december  in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long tem debt capital expenditures total represents maturities on long term debt obligations  plus contractual interest payments on all fixed rate debt 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
represents contractual obligations in place at yearend for purchase of new rides and attractions 
obligations not denominated in us dollars have been converted based on the exchange rates existing on december  off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant off balance sheet financing arrangements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and  from time to time  currency exchange rates on imported rides and equipment 
the objective of our financial risk management is to reduce the potential negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to acceptable levels 
we do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we have converted million of our term debt to variable rates averaging libor plus through the use of several swap agreements for a period of more years 
the fair market value of these swaps  which have been designated as fair value hedges on long term debt  was a net asset of million at december   and has been reflected on the balance sheet in intangibles and other assets with a corresponding increase to term debt 
at december   million of our outstanding long term debt represented fixed rate debt and million represented variable rate debt 
after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements  and assuming an average annual balance on our revolving credit borrowings  the cash flow impact of a hypothetical one percentage point change in the applicable interest rates on our variable rate debt would be approximately million as of december  impact of inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent such increases could possibly not be passed along to our guests 
in particular  increases in labor  supplies  taxes and utility expenses could have an impact on our operating results 
the majority of our employees are seasonal and are paid hourly rates  which although not tied directly to federal and state minimum wage laws  do follow those wage trends 
historically  we have been able to pass along cost increases to guests through increases in admission  food  merchandise and other prices  and we believe that we will continue to have the ability to do so to a large extent in the future 
we believe that the effects of inflation  if any  on our operating results and financial condition have been and will continue to be minor 
forward looking statements some of the statements contained in this annual report  including the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section  constitute forward looking statements 
these statements may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in such statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
important factors  including general economic conditions  competition for consumer spending  adverse weather conditions  unanticipated construction delays  the absence of historical operating experience for geauga lake  and other factors could affect attendance at our parks and cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations
