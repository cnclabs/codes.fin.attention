table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with the selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed under the headings risk factors and special note regarding forward looking statements 
overview operations we are a leading distributor of industrial  medical and specialty gases  and related welding equipment and supplies  with distribution facilities in states in the eastern united states 
we also have a growing presence in the distribution of propane in our geographic markets 
we generate revenue through the sale of packaged industrial  medical and specialty gases and the rental and delivery charges for the cylinders and tanks in which they are delivered  as well as through the sale of related welding equipment and supplies 
we sell packaged gases to customers for manufacturing  industrial  metal production and fabrication  construction  health care  mining  oil and chemicals and other applications 
sale of our packaged gases is generally not seasonal 
we also sell propane to the residential  commercial and industrial markets 
typical residential and commercial uses include conventional space heating  water heating and cooking 
typical industrial uses include engine fuel for forklifts and other vehicles  metal cutting  brazing and heat treating 
the distribution of propane is seasonal in nature and sensitive to variations in weather  with consumption as a heating fuel peaking sharply in winter months 
in fiscal  packaged gases and rental  together with related equipment and supplies  accounted for approximately of our net sales  while propane accounted for approximately of our net sales 
our cost of products sold includes the direct cost of industrial  medical and specialty gases pursuant to supply arrangements and open purchase orders with three of the five major gas producers in the united states  the purchase of hard goods from a number of vendors and the purchase of propane from one of the three major propane suppliers 
although the cost of the gases we sell is subject to formula pricing and variation based on market prices for such gases  because packaging  delivery and other services constitute a substantial portion of the cost and the value of the packaged gases we provide our customers  we believe that we are not significantly exposed to decreased margins because of those variations 
our operating  distribution and administrative expenses primarily are composed of delivery expenses  salaries  benefits  professional fees  transportation equipment operating costs  facility lease expenses and general office expenses 
we believe that changes in these expenses as a percentage of sales should be evaluated over the long term rather than on a quarter to quarter basis due to the moderate seasonality of sales mentioned above and the generally fixed nature of these expenses 
we also incur depreciation expense related to our fixed assets  including approximately  cylinders which are depreciated over a period of to years 
we also own approximately delivery vehicles that we depreciate over a period of to years 
acquisitions we believe that we have been successful in executing our strategy of growth through acquisitions  having completed over acquisitions since  the year of our initial public offering 
the consideration for most acquisitions includes a combination of a cash payment at closing  seller financing and payments under covenants not to compete and consulting agreements 
for many acquisitions  we believe that projections of future cash flows justify payment of amounts in excess of the book or market value of the assets acquired  resulting in goodwill being recorded 
some acquisitions have had  and we expect that some future acquisitions could have  a dilutive effect upon our income from operations and income before tax for a period following their consummation 
this dilution can occur because some of the benefits of acquisitions  such as leveraging of 
table of contents operating and administrative expenses  improved product gross margins and expected sales growth  occur over time 
in most cases  the operating cash flow of an acquired business has been positive in a relatively short period of time after consummation of the acquisition 
in part to manage our operations independent of the effect of acquisitions  we monitor the results of each of our locations separately 
although each location is therefore a separate operating segment  because no single store generates an amount of revenue or income  or maintains assets  in excess of the thresholds in accounting releases that would require us to report them as separate segments  and because all stores offer similar products and services  we report their results on an aggregate basis 
we do maintain records of same store sales  which are sales from those stores that have been operated by us for the full two year comparison period 
the value of sales increase related to acquisitions is determined by the specific sales of each acquired location 
new stores would be considered in same store sales once we have operated them for the entire comparison period 
variable interest entities we lease buildings and equipment and rent cylinders from west rentals  inc  gew real estate llc  realequip lease llc  equip lease co  acetylene products corp 
and plymouth holding llc  entities that are engaged primarily in the purchase  development  sale and or lease of real estate and that are controlled by gary e 
west  our chairman and principal shareholder 
under accounting interpretations that were effective for us on march   and because we are under common control with these entities  we must consolidate in our financial statements  the financial statements of these related entities 
in consolidation  the rent expense we pay to these entities is eliminated  resulting in us reporting slightly less operating  distribution and administrative expense and slightly more income from operations 
because some of the properties held by the variable interest entities are financed  and because of the amount of depreciable assets these entities hold  the consolidation results in us reporting slightly more interest and depreciation expense 
further  because we classify the rental income that these entities generate as other income for our purposes  these entities result in our reporting more other income 
all of the effect of these entities on our net income is eliminated when we deduct the net effect as a minority interest 
the real property and equipment held by these entities result in our reporting significantly higher balances of buildings and equipment on our balance sheet and  because some of these properties are subject to mortgage loans  higher indebtedness 
although these entities are controlled by related parties  we have no equity interest in any of them and the creditors and beneficial interest holders of these entities have no recourse to our general credit 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts we report in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we describe the significant accounting policies and methods that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements in note to the financial statements for the year end june  the most critical accounting matters in which we use estimates include our determination of the net carrying value of our trade receivables  our inventories  our goodwill  our other intangible assets and our employee health care benefit reserves 
if our estimates have to be revised  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these assets and the reserves  affecting our results of operations during the period when the adjustment is recorded  and affecting our net assets and equity 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
trade receivables we estimate the collectability of our trade receivables on a monthly basis 
we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts to adjust the carrying value of trade receivables to fair value based on the amount of trade receivables that we estimate are uncollectible 
we establish the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience  economic trends and our knowledge of significant accounts 
although we believe that the allowances for doubtful accounts as of june  are adequate  if a 
table of contents significant customer refuses to pay a large account  or if economic conditions cause a class of customers to be unable to pay accounts  we might be required to increase the provision for doubtful accounts  which would negatively affect our income 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined by the first in  first out method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon its physical condition  as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
estimates of physical losses of inventory are made on a quarterly basis based upon historical results 
goodwill and other intangible assets we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of july  sfas no 
requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not to be amortized  but instead to be tested for impairment at least annually 
we have elected to perform our annual test for indications of goodwill impairment as of june th of each year 
in testing the impairment of goodwill  we consider and balance a variety of valuation methods  including formal criteria of the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice  uspap for assessment of the fair market value of a business as a whole 
in accordance with uspap  we use a discounted cash flow analysis including  where applicable  appropriate market based deductions and discounts  and take into account any extraordinary assumptions and hypothetical conditions which may have an impact on our determination 
in addition to this approach for valuing our business as a whole  we also consider goodwill by location or groups of locations based upon our operating segments 
the application of each of these methods involves a number of estimates and assumptions  and the weighting and balancing of the methods and their results also involves assumptions and the application of considerable judgment 
we may be required to adjust our assumptions and estimates when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
to the extent we make this determination  we would be required to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill by taking a charge that will reduce our earnings in the period taken and reduce our equity at the end of the period 
we cannot be certain that the assumptions and judgments we have made regarding the carrying value of our goodwill will prove accurate and that we will not be required to take impairment charges in the future 
employee health care benefit reserves we have self funded health care benefit programs in place through which a third party administrator settles and pays claims by our employees on an on going basis 
we estimate the level of outstanding claims  at any point in time  including claims incurred but not reported  based upon historical payment patterns  knowledge of individual claims and estimates of health care costs 
we have stop loss insurance coverage in place to limit the extent of individual claims 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
estimates of the remaining useful lives of assets are reviewed at least annually at the close of the fiscal year 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of discounted or undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  under which deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between 
table of contents the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the estimated tax rate at the date of reversal 
these differences are classified as current or non current based upon the classification of the related asset or liability 
for temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability  classification is based upon the expected reversal date of the temporary difference 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we estimate and record additional tax expense based on uncertain tax positions taken by us within statutory limitations 
this estimate is adjusted when tax audits are completed or when the statute of limitations expires on those recorded tax positions 
results of operations the following table presents information about our results of operations as a percentage of net sales 
as a percentage of net sales year ended june  net sales cost of products sold  excluding depreciation and amortization operating  distribution and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization income from operations interest expense other income earnings before minority interest minority interest earnings before taxes provision for income taxes net earnings comparison of years ended june  and our net sales increased million or to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  packaged gases and cylinder rental revenue represented of net sales for the year ended june  and hard goods represented of net sales  with total revenue from our packaged gas business representing of net sales 
in comparison  packaged gases and cylinder rental revenue represented of net sales for the year ended june  and hard goods represented of net sales  with total revenue from our packaged gas business representing of net sales 
sales of hard goods increased million or from fiscal to fiscal  reflecting increased demand from the improved economy  increased prices resulting from increased steel costs and increased sales volume 
propane sales represented of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal propane sales increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal due to price increases 
propane gallons sold were down in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  reflecting reduced demand due to conservation resulting from higher prices of all energy sources and warmer temperatures in our markets compared to the prior year period 
our cost of products sold increased million or to million for the year ended june   compared to million for the year ended june  cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales was and for the years ended june  and  respectively 
increased prices in hard goods  packaged gases and cylinder rental resulting from our efforts to standardize our product offerings and pricing were offset by higher propane costs as a percentage of net sales 

table of contents operating  distribution and administrative expenses decreased million or less than to million in the year ended june   compared to million for the year ended june  consolidation of the variable interest entities resulted in a decrease of million in building rent expense 
although personnel costs and equipment rent were also reduced  these reductions were partially offset by increased legal and professional fees  vehicle fuel and repair costs and expense for operating supplies 
operating  distribution and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were for the year ended june   compared to for the year ended june  depreciation expense increased million to million in the year ended june   from million in the year ended june   reflecting depreciation related to the variable interest entities and increased depreciation resulting from increased capital expenditures 
amortization of intangibles decreased million to million in the year ended june   compared to million in the year ended june  this decrease was primarily the result of certain intangibles becoming fully amortized during the current year 
interest expense decreased million or to million for the year ended june   compared to million in the year ended june  this decrease was primarily the result of reduced outstanding debt balances and lower interest rates due to improved financial performance 
interest expense for the year ended june  was partially offset by the inclusion of million related to the variable interest entities which were not consolidated in the prior year 
other income increased million to million in the year ended june   compared to million in the year ended june   due primarily to income earned by the variable interest entities 
minority interest earnings reflect the elimination of net pre tax income earned by the variable interest entities 
the amount eliminated is primarily the reduction in operating expense noted above  partially offset by expenses incurred by the entities 
our effective tax rate increased from for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  for the reasons stated above  our net earnings increased million or to million for the year ended june   compared to million for the year ended june  diluted earnings per share were for the year ended june   compared to for the year ended june  comparison of years ended june  and our net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal acquisitions made during the preceding twelve months contributed million of the increase in net sales for fiscal  while same store sales increased million or 
packaged gases and cylinder rental revenue represented of our net sales in fiscal and hard goods represented of net sales  with total revenue from our packaged gas business representing of net sales 
in comparison  packaged gases and cylinder rental revenue represented of our net sales in fiscal and hard goods represented of net sales  with total revenue from our packaged gases business representing of net sales 
sales of hard goods decreased million in fiscal from fiscal on a same store basis  reflecting the effect of the decline in the economy during the period and our decision to reduce activity with selective low margin accounts 
propane sales represented of net sales in fiscal  compared to of net sales in fiscal propane sales increased million on a same store basis in fiscal compared to the prior year period  reflecting million in price inflation and a million increase due to increase in the volume of propane sold 
our cost of products sold decreased million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales improved from during fiscal to during fiscal the decreased costs reflect the non recurrence during fiscal of a million charge for disposal of slow moving hard goods inventory in fiscal  as well as improvements in costs for hard goods that we achieved by standardizing our product offerings 

table of contents operating  distribution and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal approximately million of this decrease is due to a net reduction in expenses resulting from the consolidation under fin r of variable interest entities 
the reduced expenses also reflected the results of our cost reduction initiatives 
the majority of these expense reductions were in the areas of wages  benefits  legal  professional and other general expenses 
these cost savings were partially offset by the cancellation of related party lease obligations of million 
lastly  the fiscal results included charges associated with our cost reduction initiatives totaling million for the year 
operating  distribution and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were for fiscal  compared to for fiscal depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily a result of certain intangibles becoming fully amortized  partially offset by million of increased depreciation expense related to the variable interest entities 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  reflecting primarily the effect of reduced outstanding debt balances and lower interest rates due to improved financial performance 
included in interest expense was a decrease of  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively  to record changes in the fair market value of our interest rate swap agreements under sfas no 
interest expense also included million related to the variable interest entities since the march  consolidation 
other income increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to income earned by the variable interest entities 
this income is not derived from any properties that we own 
minority interest earnings reflect the elimination of net pre tax income earned during the quarter by the variable interest entities 
the amount eliminated is primarily the reduction in rent expense and other income noted above  partially offset by expenses incurred by the entities 
our effective tax rate decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal due to a tax benefit of approximately million relating to the donation of inventory to a qualified charitable entity  which resulted in a tax deduction for the fair market value of the inventory 
for the reasons stated above  our net income increased to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal diluted earnings per share were for fiscal  compared to for fiscal quarterly operating results the following table presents summary information about our sales  income from operations  net earnings and earnings per share on a quarterly basis for each of the last two fiscal years fiscal fiscal quarter ended quarter ended sept

march june unaudited thousands except per share data net sales income from operations net earnings basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share as illustrated in the table above  we generally have experienced higher sales activity during our second and third quarters as a result of seasonal sales of propane  with corresponding lower sales for the first and fourth quarters 
superimposed on this seasonal fluctuation in sales is a favorable year to year trend in both net 
table of contents sales and earnings 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our quarterly sales as a percentage of the respective fiscal year s sales 
results for any one or more periods are not necessarily indicative of continuing trends 
year ended june  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter as illustrated  income from operations and net earnings typically are higher for the second and third quarters than for the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year 
the timing of acquisitions may also have an appreciable effect on quarter to quarter earnings 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations  capital expenditures and debt service with funds provided from operating activities 
acquisitions have been financed by a combination of seller financing  bank borrowings and funds generated from operations 
at june   we had working capital of approximately million  compared to million as of june   reflecting primarily an increase in accounts receivable and available cash partially offset by accounts payable 
funds provided by operations for the year ended june  were approximately million  compared to million for the year ended june  this increase of million is attributable to the million increase in net income offset by changes in other operating assets and liabilities 
funds used for investing activities were approximately million for the year ended june   consisting of capital spending and the purchase of plymouth wayne welding supplies  inc  compared to million for the year ended june  we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million for fiscal year june  funds used for financing activities for the year ended june  were approximately million as net borrowings of million were more than offset by debt repayment of million and the repayment of prior year bank overdraft of million 
in addition  dividend payments of million and a distribution by the variable interest entities of million were partially offset by funds received through the exercise of stock options totaling million 
our cash balance increased million during the year ended june  to million 
at june   we had working capital of approximately million  compared to million as of june   reflecting primarily the reduction in inventory of million and the reduction of accounts receivable of funds provided by operations for the year ended june  were approximately million  compared to million for the year ended june  this increase of million is primarily attributable to the million increase of net income  receipt of an income tax refund of million  the non recurrence of inventory write offs of million and reduction in inventory of million 
funds used in investing activities were approximately million for the year ended june   consisting primarily of capital spending  compared to million for the year ended june  funds used in financing activities for the year ended june  were approximately million from net payments of debt  compared to million for the year ended june  our cash balance decreased million during the year ended june  to million 

table of contents at june   we had the following contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands long term debt estimated interest payments interest rate swap payments interest rate swap receipts capital lease obligation operating leases  net of intercompany eliminations purchase obligations total obligations some of these obligations  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations  are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the table provides contractually obligated payment amounts  including estimated interest  by period due 
for interest rate swaps  payments and receipts are calculated based upon notional amounts at weighted average rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on the one month libor rate in effect at the reporting date 
no assumptions have been made for future changes in the one month libor rate 
in january  we entered into swap agreements for notional value of million effective july and january purchase obligations represent the total value of all open purchase orders for the purchase of inventory and distribution vehicles 
other long term liabilities at june  and june  consist primarily of deferred revenue related to cylinder rentals with an average term of seven to ten years  which has been excluded from the table above 
our credit facility provides for a million revolving loan  which we may draw down from time to time 
the maturity date is april  we may draw down funds as a revolving loan or a swing line loan or obtain letters of credit 
each draw may  at our discretion be either a eurodollar loan or a floating rate loan 
in the case of eurodollar loans  interest is calculated as the sum of i the quotient of a libor  divided by b one minus a specific reserve requirement expressed as a decimal  plus ii an applicable margin set forth in the pricing schedule to the credit facility 
in the case of floating rate loans  interest is calculated as the sum of i the higher of a the prime rate and b the sum of the federal funds effective rate plus  plus ii the same applicable margin applied to eurodollar loans 
subject to certain exceptions  we can draw on the credit facility in minimum amounts of million in the case of floating rate loans or million in the case of eurodollar loans 
the weighted average interest rate for substantially all of the borrowings under the credit facility was as of june  as of june   availability under the revolving loan was approximately million  with outstanding borrowings of approximately million and outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
we expect to use the revolving loan in the future primarily to fund acquisitions 
we are not required to make principal payments on outstanding balances of the revolving loan as long as certain covenants are satisfied 
the credit facility contains various financial covenants applicable to us  including covenants requiring minimum fixed charge coverage and maximum funded debt to ebitda 
as of june   we were in compliance with these covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance through at least the next twelve months 
the credit facility permits the payment of cash dividends on our common stock so long as the aggregate amount of cash dividends paid to shareholders who are not parties to the credit facility during any fiscal year and the aggregate purchase price paid by us for any shares of our common stock redeemed in the same fiscal year does not exceed million 

table of contents the variable interest entities had outstanding debt  consisting primarily of asset backed mortgages for real estate  of million at june  the carrying value of the land and buildings that secure this debt was approximately million at june  this debt carries various interest rates ranging from to and various maturities from to some of the mortgages on which the variable interest entities are obligated are personally guaranteed by our chairman 
we are also obligated under various promissory notes related to the financing of acquisitions that have various rates of interest ranging from to per annum and maturities through the outstanding balance of these notes as of june  was million 
some of these notes are secured by assets related to the applicable acquisition  some are unsecured and some are backed by bank letters of credit issued under our credit facility 
the schedule of maturities of our debt for the next five years and thereafter is as follows variable fiscal year ending june  valley interest entities company thereafter total we enter into contractual agreements in the ordinary course of business to hedge our exposure to interest rate risks 
counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions 
we believe that the risk of incurring losses related to credit risk of the counterparty is remote and any losses would be immaterial 
interest rate swap agreements are used to reduce interest rate risks and costs inherent in our debt portfolio 
we enter into these agreements to change the variable fixed interest rate mix of our debt portfolio in order to maintain the percentage of fixed and variable debt within parameters that we have established 
accordingly  we enter into agreements to effectively convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
as of june   we had million in notional amounts outstanding under interest rate swap agreements 
these swaps have an average pay rate of versus a receive rate of 
we believe that cash generated from operations  borrowing availability under our credit facility and the ability to obtain financing with sellers of businesses will be sufficient to satisfy our requirements for operating funds  capital expenditures and future acquisitions for at least the next twelve months 
inflation the impact of inflation on our operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally low rates of inflation in the economy and our historical ability to pass purchase price increases to our customers in the form of sales price increases 
while inflation has not had  and we do not expect that it will have  a material impact upon operating results  there is no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation or that we will continue to be able to pass price increases to our customers in the future 
new accounting standards in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  that requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight and handling costs be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  it requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the standard will be effective in our fiscal year beginning july  we do not anticipate any significant charge or expense from the adoption of this standard 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued staff position fsp no

risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the following risks and the other information contained in this prospectus before purchasing our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations 
we may not be able to identify  consummate and integrate suitable acquisitions or achieve the benefits we expect from acquisitions 
one of our principal business strategies is to pursue growth through the acquisition of other independent distributors 
because we focus our acquisition efforts on market areas in which we have an existing presence and on bordering market areas  we may not always be able to find suitable acquisition candidates 
even if we are able to identify an attractive acquisition candidate  we may incorrectly judge its value  may not locate and assess all its liabilities and may not be able to negotiate the terms of the acquisition successfully 
in addition  we may have difficulty integrating the products  services or technologies of the acquired business into our operations  retaining key employees and retaining customers of the acquired company 
although we believe that we have more carefully controlled customer attrition in our recent acquisitions  loss of customers has had significant adverse consequences in some of our acquisitions and could occur in the future 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  strain our resources  distract our workforce and divert our management s attention from our day to day operations 
acquisitions may also result in lower than expected sales and net 
table of contents income  higher than expected costs and liabilities or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties 
we may need additional capital to finance our acquisitions  which may limit our ability to successfully grow through acquisitions or require us to accept unfavorable financing terms in connection with a potential acquisition 
our acquisitions have historically been debt financed  and we expect that future acquisitions will be financed primarily with internally generated funds supplemented with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and seller financing as necessary 
we may not be able to obtain financing when needed or on terms favorable to us 
this may limit our ability to execute our growth strategy successfully or require us to accept unfavorable financing terms 
we do not currently use shares of our common stock or other securities as consideration for acquisitions  but we may do so in the future and may issue common stock to raise cash that is used in acquisitions 
if we decide to acquire businesses through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our shareholders would be reduced and these securities might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current shareholders and purchasers in this offering 
an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
acquisitions frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets 
at march   goodwill represented approximately of our total assets 
goodwill is no longer amortized and is subject to impairment testing at least annually using a fair value based approach 
in testing the impairment of goodwill  we consider and balance a variety of valuation methods  including formal criteria of the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice  or uspap  for assessment of the fair market value of a business as a whole 
in accordance with uspap  we use a discounted cash flow analysis including  where applicable  appropriate market based deductions and discounts  and take into account any extraordinary assumptions and hypothetical conditions which may have an impact on our determination 
in addition to this approach for valuing our business as a whole  we also consider goodwill by location or groups of locations based upon our operating segments 
the application of each of these methods involves a number of estimates and assumptions  and the weighting and balancing of the methods and their results also involves assumptions and the application of considerable judgment 
we may be required to adjust our assumptions and estimates when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
to the extent we make this determination  we would be required to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill by taking a charge that will reduce our earnings in the period taken and reduce our equity at the end of the period 
we cannot be certain that the assumptions and judgments we have made regarding the carrying value of our goodwill will prove accurate and that we will not be required to take impairment charges in the future 
if we are unable to effectively manage our growth  our financial and managerial resources may be stressed and our business may be harmed 
any future growth will require us to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information and control systems and human resources on a timely basis and to maintain effective cost controls 
in addition  we have made staff reductions as part of our profit improvement plan 
as we grow  implement controls and procedures under the sarbanes oxley act of and handle other extraordinary corporate events  our human resources may be strained 
for example  we could experience difficulties that could delay or prevent us from upgrading our technology and network infrastructure  which could impede the improvement of such systems 
we cannot fully assess our ability to manage our growth successfully in the future 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our financial and managerial resources may become overextended and our financial condition and operating results  including our profitability  could be significantly harmed 

table of contents we might not be able to achieve continued improvements in  or avoid deterioration in  our operating results through our process improvement plan 
although we achieved improved operating results in fiscal and in fiscal that we have attributed to our process improvement plan  many facets of that plan have already been implemented and we cannot predict whether these measures will generate any further benefits 
further  we cannot be certain that the cost savings measures we have implemented  including staff reductions and location consolidation  will not have a longer term negative impact on our customer relationships or our ability to manage our business 
we face competition in our industry and may have difficulty expanding and maintaining our customer base 
our profitability may be affected by competition  which is based primarily on service  customer loyalty and  to a lesser extent  price 
there are several competitors in each of the markets in which we operate  some of which are able to compete with us for larger customers by providing services over a larger geography 
many customers tend to develop long term relationships with their distributor and it may  therefore  be difficult for us to gain new customers  other than through the acquisition of other distribution businesses 
if we are unable to increase or maintain our customer base  our revenues may decline and our profitability may be negatively impacted 
in addition  our competitors may seek to maintain or increase their market share by reducing prices 
if we reduce the price of our products in response to competition in our industry  our revenues  income and cash flows may be adversely impacted and we may not be able to maintain our current profitability levels  to continue the level of capital expenditure necessary to support our business or to meet our obligations under our debt instruments 
failure to retain our key employees or attract and retain qualified technical personnel could harm our competitive position 
our businesses are managed by a small number of management and operating personnel  the loss of certain of whom could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we believe that our ability to manage our planned growth successfully will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
with the exception of our chairman  our executive officers have changed since our initial public offering in further changes could cause business disruption 
we maintain non compete agreements with some of our key sales management personnel  particularly those personnel at acquired locations  and have employment agreements with our president and our chief operating officer that contain covenants against competition 
we do not  however  have these agreements with all key personnel 
in our industry  identifying  hiring and retaining new  highly skilled technical and managerial personnel is both a competitive and costly process 
if we fail to retain our key employees  the expansion of our business could be inhibited  harming our competitive position  and our income and resources may decline and cause your investment in us to lose value 
increased energy and other costs could reduce our profitability 
energy costs  which are to a large extent subject to factors beyond our control  impact our business in several respects 
because the production of industrial gases requires significant amounts of electrical energy  industrial gas prices have historically increased as the cost of electric energy has increased 
shortages of energy may cause energy prices to continue to rise and  as a result  increase the cost of industrial gases 
historically  we have not entered into hedging agreements to protect us from increases in energy costs 
in addition  a portion of our distribution costs consists of diesel fuel costs  which have recently increased to record levels 
furthermore  the price of propane is influenced significantly by the cost of crude oil  largely because propane competes with crude oil based fuels 
as the price of propane continues to reflect the rising price of crude oil  our sales of propane may decrease and adversely affect our financial results 
although we have historically been able to pass most of the increases in the above referenced costs to our customers  we may not be able to continue to do so in the future 
increases in energy costs and other costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers could significantly reduce our profitability 

table of contents general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control may adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may adversely affect our results of operations  many of which are beyond our control 
recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in regions and industries in which our customers operate can adversely affect our business 
in addition  economic conditions may adversely affect our customers  many of whom are in businesses that are cyclical in nature 
customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss  and we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we are also affected by increases in insurance and transportation costs and interest rates 
in addition  we cannot predict the effects of actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks  efforts to combat terrorism  military action against any foreign state or group located in a foreign state or heightened security requirements on the economy or consumer confidence in the united states 
any of these events could impair our operating efficiency and productivity or result in increased costs for us due to security measures 
because the distribution and sale of propane is weather related  changes in the weather could adversely affect our revenues 
much of the distribution and sale of propane is seasonal in nature and sensitive to variations in weather  with consumption as a heating fuel peaking sharply in winter months 
sales of propane may be negatively impacted during periods of warm weather  and sustained periods of weather conditions inconsistent with normal weather patterns can create volatility in our earnings 
significantly warmer weather could decrease the demand for propane and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we could be adversely affected by increases in health care costs 
we provide health care benefits to our employees under self funded programs through which a third party administrator settles and pays claims by our employees that we fund and for which we accrue costs 
we established a reserve for these costs based on our estimate of the level of outstanding claims  including claims incurred but not reported  based upon historical payment patterns  knowledge of individual claims and estimates of health care costs 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not accurately reflect the actual level of outstanding claims and the resulting costs 
because our employee health care benefit program is self funded and we assume the risk of health care costs of our employees up to a limit on every individual claim  we may be adversely affected by the rising costs of health care  an increase in the number of such claims or an increase in the value of individual claims 
the unionization of part of our workforce may adversely affect our operating results 
approximately of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we are required to negotiate the wages  salaries  benefits and other terms with these employees collectively 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by labor negotiations and or labor disputes in the future  particularly if a greater portion of our workforce joins a union 
we are dependent upon relatively few suppliers and if one or more of these suppliers discontinued sales to us  our operations might be temporarily interrupted 
there are several competing suppliers of most of the products that we purchase  although for business reasons we have concentrated our purchases with only a few suppliers 
we purchase industrial gases pursuant to supply arrangements and open purchase orders with three of the five major gas producers in the united states 
the largest such producer accounted for approximately of our gas purchases in fiscal we purchase welding equipment and consumable supplies from a number of vendors  of which the top five vendors represented approximately of our total purchases in fiscal we purchased of our propane from a single supplier in fiscal although we believe that supplies have historically been readily available  if one or more of these suppliers were to unexpectedly discontinue sales of a product to us  we would have to secure alternate sources of supply  and we could experience decreases in our profit margins if our 
table of contents arrangements with such alternate sources of supply were less favorable than those with our current suppliers and a decrease in our revenue if we were unable to obtain a sufficient supply of product 
our inability to comply with certain financial covenants in our revolving credit facility could have an adverse effect on our business and the price of our common stock 
our credit facility provides for revolving borrowings of up to million maturing on april  the facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains various financial covenants applicable to us  including covenants requiring minimum fixed charge coverage and maximum funded debt to earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
although we are currently in compliance with these covenants  a failure to comply would constitute a default under the credit facility 
a default  if not waived by our lenders  could cause our outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility becoming immediately due and payable  and could also cause cross defaults under other agreements that results in the indebtedness under those agreements to become immediately due and payable as well 
if we were required to obtain waivers of a default or defaults  we could incur significant fees and transaction costs 
if waivers of defaults are not obtained  we might have difficulty borrowing sufficient additional funds to repay the debt 
even if new financing is made available to us  it may not be available on acceptable terms 
our business is subject to product liability claims  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
propane is  and many of the other industrial gases we sell are  extremely flammable  explosive products 
serious personal injury  property damage or loss of life can result from improper transportation  storage  production or use of these products 
further  the industrial products we sell often contain or produce toxic substances that may cause injury or damage if improperly formulated or used 
for example  some of our competitors have been found liable for alleged injuries and diseases from exposure to asbestos in welding rods and we have been named in suits alleging damages for exposure to both asbestos and manganese fumes from welding rods 
our business entails an inherent risk of liability in the event of product failure or damages resulting from the use of our products and we  therefore  maintain product liability insurance against any such claims in amounts we believe to be adequate 
although we have never been subject to significant liability for product related issues and believe our liability as a product distributor may be more limited than the liability of manufacturers of such products  we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to a significant claim in the future  that we will be able to successfully defend claims  or that if we were to be found liable on a claim  it would not exceed the limits of our insurance coverage 
furthermore  we can not be certain that we will be able to continue to obtain liability insurance on acceptable terms 
we have been subject to litigation on other matters that could  if resolved unfavorably  adversely impact our operating results 
we have  from time to time  been the subject of suits alleging violations of employment law  vehicular damage  injury and various other actions 
these suits often seek punitive damages  attorneys fees  injunctive relief and other remedies  and there is management and employee time taken to handle these claims 
some of our insurance policies do not cover punitive damages or provide for the payment of attorneys fees in addition to the limits of coverage 
there are  for example  currently several actions pending against us alleging damages in connection with employment or termination of employment 
there is no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to protect us from claims 
an unfavorable result in these actions could adversely impact our operations during the period decided 
there are transactions with related parties that may result in conflicts of interest 
we have entered into a number of transactions with related parties  including variable interest entities in which certain of our directors and executive officers have interests 
for example  we lease buildings from west rentals  inc  of which are leased pursuant to a master lease agreement that terminates in april and two are leased pursuant to pass through subleases 
mr 
west is the sole shareholder of west rentals 
we have also entered into other transactions with related parties 
these related party transactions could cause 
table of contents conflicts of interest between us and the other parties to the transaction  which could lead to less favorable results than if the transactions had been with unrelated parties 
for more information on these related party transactions  see certain transactions with the selling shareholder or companies controlled by him 
our financial statements reflect assets  liabilities and results of several entities controlled by our chairman and in which we have no economic interest 
we have been required under recently adopted accounting principles to consolidate in our financial statements the financial results and position of several entities controlled by gary e 
west  chairman of our board of directors and our largest shareholder 
although we do not have any equity interest in these entities  this consolidation causes us to report less operating  distribution and administrative expense because the rent expense we pay to these entities is reduced in consolidation  more interest and depreciation expense because the properties these entities hold are financed and generate considerable depreciation  more other income because we report the rental income that these entities generate  higher balances of buildings and equipment representing the principal asset of these entities  and higher indebtedness because of the outstanding mortgage loans on those properties 
our financial ratios and our ability to comply with the financial covenants contained in credit and other agreements could be adversely affected by the inclusion of the results of operations of these entities and the asset and liability balances they hold  our financial results could be more volatile and difficult to understand and some forms of financing such as asset backed securitization may become less available or more costly to us because of this consolidation 
we are subject to a right of first refusal agreement which may delay or restrict future equity financings and transactions 
in connection with one of our acquisitions we entered into a right of first refusal agreement with our largest shareholder gary e 
west  several of mr 
west s affiliated persons and entities  and praxair  inc the right of first refusal agreement  which is effective through september   provides praxair the right to match any third party offer to purchase all or a material part of our assets  to match any offer to purchase shares from mr 
west and his affiliates that would cause their ownership of our common stock to drop below on a fully diluted basis  and to purchase all of the shares held by mr 
west and his affiliates if mr 
west proposes to dispose of his shares in a transaction prior to the expiration of the agreement that would result in his controlling less than of our shares  or if we issue additional shares that would cause his ownership to drop below that percentage 
provisions of our charter documents and pennsylvania law could restrict certain actions that you may consider favorable and could deprive you of opportunities to sell your shares of our common stock at prices higher than prevailing market prices 
our articles of incorporation give our board of directors the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock  while potentially providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
the pennsylvania business corporation law authorizes our directors  in discharging their fiduciary duties  to consider the interests of a number of different 
table of contents constituencies  such as employees  suppliers  customers  creditors  shareholders and the communities in which our offices or other establishments are located  and does not require our directors to consider or favor the interests of our shareholders to a greater degree than those of other constituencies 
furthermore  certain provisions of our articles  our bylaws and the pennsylvania business corporation law including provisions allowing the removal of a director by shareholders only for cause  providing for the board of directors to be divided into three classes to serve for staggered three year terms and setting forth a heightened quorum for certain actions by shareholders could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control that our shareholders may consider favorable or beneficial 
these provisions may also reduce the likelihood of our acquisition at a premium price by another person or entity 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as a result  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of will require us to evaluate and report on our internal controls over financial reporting and have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to our evaluation  beginning with our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending june  the process of strengthening our internal controls and complying with section will be expensive and time consuming  and will require significant attention of management 
we cannot be certain that the measures we take will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
if we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness  the disclosure of that fact  even if quickly remedied  would reduce the market s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price 
in addition  a delay in compliance with section could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions  including the suspension or delisting of our common stock from the american stock exchange and the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our common stock  which would further reduce our stock price
