financial information about foreign operations and business segments we manufacture our products in the united states  mexico  australia  italy  and the united kingdom for sale throughout the world and maintain sales offices in the united states  canada  belgium  the united kingdom  france  australia  singapore  japan  china  and italy 
new product development is pursued primarily in the united states 
our net sales outside the united states were percent  percent  and percent of total consolidated net sales for fiscal   and  respectively 
a portion of our cash flow is derived from sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
to reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on these sales and purchase commitments  we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for select transactions 
for additional information regarding our foreign currency exchange contracts  see item a entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
for additional financial information regarding our foreign operations and each of our segments  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements entitled segment data  included in item of part ii of this report 
manufacturing and production in some areas of our business  we are primarily an assembler  while in others we serve as a fully integrated manufacturer 
we have strategically identified specific core manufacturing competencies for vertical integration and have chosen outside vendors to provide other services 
we design component parts in cooperation with our vendors  contract with them for the development of tooling  and then enter into agreements with these vendors to purchase component parts manufactured using the tooling 
in addition  our vendors regularly test new technologies to be applied to the design and production of component parts 
manufacturing operations include robotic and computer automated equipment to speed production  reduce costs  and improve the quality  fit  and finish of every product 
operations are also designed to be flexible enough to accommodate product design changes required to respond to market demand 
in order to utilize our manufacturing facilities and technology more effectively  we pursue continuous improvements in our manufacturing processes 
we have some flexible assembly lines that can handle a wide product mix and deliver products when customers require them 
additionally  we spend considerable effort to reduce manufacturing costs through lean methods and process improvement  product and platform design  application of advanced technology  enhanced environmental management systems  sku consolidation  safety improvements  and better supply chain management 
we also manufacture products sold under a private label agreement to a third party on a competitive basis  and we have agreements with other third party manufacturers to manufacture products on our behalf 
our professional products are manufactured throughout the year 
our residential spring and summer products are also generally manufactured throughout the year 
however  our residential fall and winter products are generally manufactured in the summer and fall months 
our products are tested in conditions and locations similar to those in which they are used 
we use computer aided design and manufacturing systems to shorten the time between initial concept and final production 
our production levels and inventory management goals are based on estimates of demand for our products  taking into account production capacity  timing of shipments  and field inventory levels 
we also periodically shut down production to allow for maintenance  rearrangement  and capital equipment installation at the manufacturing facilities 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately to million  which is to million higher than fiscal capital expenditures as we expect to continue to invest in information service technology  manufacturing equipment  and tooling for new products 
engineering and research we are committed to an ongoing engineering program dedicated to developing innovative new products and improvements in the quality and performance of existing products 
however  a focus on innovation also carries certain risks that new technology will be slow to be accepted by the marketplace 
management mitigates this risk through focus on and commitment to understanding our customers needs and requirements 
our engineering expenses are primarily incurred in connection with the development of new products that may have additional applications or represent extensions of existing product lines  improvements to existing products  and cost reduction efforts 
our expenditures for engineering and research were approximately million percent of net sales in fiscal  million percent of net sales in fiscal  and million percent of net sales in fiscal in fiscal  we anticipate engineering and research costs to increase compared to fiscal as we expect to continue to invest in new product development 
raw materials most of the components of our products are commercially available from a number of sources and are in adequate supply 
therefore  we are generally not dependent on any one supplier  except for engines from japanese suppliers used in some of our professional segment products 
in fiscal  we experienced no significant work stoppages as a result of shortages of raw materials or commodities  despite the hurricanes in the gulf of mexico  as we are dual sourced for a majority of our raw material requirements 
the highest value component costs are generally engines  steel  transmissions  transaxles  hydraulics  electric motors  and plastic resin purchased from several suppliers around the world 
we have some long term commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials that management believes are unlikely to be terminated prematurely 
during the past two years  we have experienced an increase in costs of certain raw materials  such as steel and other commodities that has resulted in a negative impact on our gross margins and net earnings for fiscal and we have somewhat offset and expect to continue to mitigate the impact of these increased costs through internal cost reduction efforts  selective price increases  and vendor negotiations 
service and warranty our products are warranted to ensure customer confidence in design  workmanship  and overall quality 
warranty length varies depending on whether product usage is for residential or professional applications within individual product lines 
some products have an over the counter exchange option and some have a day satisfaction guarantee 
warranty coverage ranges from a period of six months to seven years  and generally covers parts  labor  and other expenses for non maintenance repairs  provided operator abuse  improper use  or negligence did not necessitate the repair 
an authorized toro  lawn boy and or exmark distributor or dealer must perform warranty work 
distributors  dealers  and contractors submit claims for warranty reimbursement and are credited for the cost of repairs  labor  and other expenses as long as the repairs meet our prescribed standards 
warranty expense is accrued at the time of sale based on  among other factors  historical claims experience by individual product lines 
warranty reserves are also accrued for major rework campaigns 
service support outside of the warranty period is provided by independent toro  lawn boy and or exmark distributors and dealers at the customer s expense 
we also sell extended warranty coverage on select products for when the factory warranty period expires 
product liability we have rigorous product safety standards and work continually to improve the safety and reliability of our products 
we monitor accidents and possible claims and establish liability estimates with respect to claims based on internal evaluations of the merits of individual claims 
we purchase excess insurance coverage for catastrophic product liability claims for incidents that exceed our self insured retention levels 
patents we hold patents in the united states and foreign countries and apply for patents as applicable 
although management believes our patents have value to us  our patent protection does not deter competitors from attempting to develop similar products 
patent protection is considered to be very beneficial 
however  we are not materially dependent on any one or more of our patents 
to prevent possible infringement of our patents by others  we periodically review competitors products 
to avoid potential liability with respect to others patents  we regularly review patents issued by the us patent and trademark office and foreign patent offices as needed 
these activities help us minimize risk of patent infringement litigation 
we are currently involved in patent litigation cases  both where we are asserting patents and where we are defending against charges of infringement 
while the ultimate results of the current cases are unknown at this time  we believe that the outcome of these cases is unlikely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial results 
seasonality sales of our residential products  which accounted for approximately percent of total consolidated net sales in fiscal  are seasonal  with sales of lawn and garden products occurring primarily between february and may  and sales of snow removal equipment occurring primarily between july and january 
opposite seasons in some global markets somewhat moderate this seasonality of residential product sales 
seasonality of professional product sales also exists  but is tempered because the selling season in the west coast  southern states  and our markets in the southern hemisphere such as australia  latin america  and asia continues for a longer portion of the year than in northern regions of the world 
overall  worldwide sales levels are historically highest in our fiscal second quarter and retail demand is generally highest in our fiscal third quarter 
historically  accounts receivable balances increase between january and april as a result of higher sales volumes and extended payment terms made available to our customers 
accounts receivable balances decrease between may and december when payments are received 
our financing requirements are subject to variations due to seasonal changes in working capital levels  which typically increase in the first half of our fiscal year and then decrease in the second half of our fiscal year 
seasonal cash requirements of our business are financed from operations and with our bank credit lines 
peak borrowing generally occurs between february and may 
the following table shows total consolidated net sales and net earnings for each quarter as a percentage of the total year 
fiscal fiscal net net net net quarter sales earnings sales earnings first second third fourth effects of weather from time to time  unusual weather conditions in a particular worldwide region may adversely affect retail sales of our products and result in a negative impact on our future net sales 
as the percentage of our net sales from outside the united states continues to increase  our dependency on weather in any one part of the world decreases 
nonetheless  weather conditions could materially affect our future net sales 
distribution and marketing we market the majority of our products through approximately domestic and foreign distributors  as well as a number of hardware retailers  home centers  and mass retailers in more than countries worldwide 
toro and lawn boy residential products  such as walk power mowers  riding products  and snow throwers  are sold to distributors  including toro owned distributors  for resale to retail dealers throughout the united states 
walk power mowers  snow throwers  and riding products are also sold directly to dealers and home centers 
home solutions products and retail irrigation products are sold directly to home centers  mass retailers  hardware retailers  and dealers 
we also sell selected residential products over the internet  mainly through internet retailers 
internationally  residential products are sold direct to retail dealers and mass merchandisers in australia  belgium  canada  and the united kingdom 
in most other countries  products are mainly sold to distributors for resale to dealers and mass merchandisers 
worldwide  professional products are sold mainly to distributors for resale to dealers  sports complexes  industrial facilities  contractors  municipalities  rental stores  and or golf courses 
we also sell some professional segment products directly to government customers and rental centers 
selected residential commercial irrigation products are also sold directly to professional irrigation distributors 
compact utility loaders and attachments are sold directly to dealers and large rental centers 
as of october   we owned two domestic distribution companies 
our primary purposes in owning domestic distributorships are to develop a best practices model of distribution that could be replicated by our independent distributors and to facilitate ownership transfers while improving operations 
these distribution companies sell professional and residential products directly to retail dealers and customers primarily in the united states and a majority of their revenues are derived from toro manufactured products 
our distribution systems are intended to assure quality of sales and market presence as well as effective after purchase service and support 
we consider our distribution network to be a competitive advantage in marketing our products 
our current marketing strategy is to maintain distinct brands and brand identification for toro  lawn boy  exmark  lawn genie  irritrol  hayter  and pope products 
we advertise our residential products during appropriate seasons throughout the year on television  radio  in print  and via the internet 
professional products are advertised in print and through direct mail programs as well as on the internet 
most of our advertising emphasizes our brand names 
advertising is purchased directly by the company as well as through cooperative programs with distributors  dealers  hardware retailers  home centers  and mass retailers 
customers overall  management believes that in the long term we are not dependent on a single customer 
however  the home depot accounted for greater than percent of our total consolidated net sales in fiscal   and the residential segment is generally dependent on the home depot as a customer 
while the loss of any substantial customer could have a material short term impact on our business  we believe that our diverse distribution channels and customer base should reduce the long term impact of any such loss 
backlog of orders the approximate backlog of orders believed to be firm as of october  and was million and million  respectively 
this percent decrease is due mainly to lower backlog of international orders as of october  due to a shorter required order lead time for residential products as a result of a new online ordering system implemented for international customers 
we expect the existing backlog of orders will be filled in early fiscal competition our products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world 
the principal competitive factors in our markets are pricing  product innovation  quality and reliability  product support and customer service  warranty  reputation  distribution  shelf space  and financing options 
pricing has become an increasingly important competitive factor for a majority of our products 
management believes we offer total solutions and full service packages with high quality products that have the latest technology and design innovations 
also  by selling our products through a network of distributors  dealers  hardware retailers  home centers  and mass retailers  we offer comprehensive service support during and after the warranty period 
we compete in many product lines with numerous manufacturers  many of who have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
management believes that we have a competitive advantage because we manufacture a broad range of product lines  we focus on lean manufacturing methods  and we have a strong focus in maintaining landscapes 
in addition  management believes toro s commitment to product innovation  customer service  and distribution channels positions us well to compete in various markets 
internationally  residential segment products can face more competition where foreign competitors manufacture and market products in their respective countries 
we experience this competition primarily in europe and asia 
in addition  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price of our products in foreign markets  thereby impacting their competitiveness 
we provide pricing support to foreign customers  as needed  to remain competitive in international markets 
environmental matters and other governmental regulation we are subject to a wide variety of federal  state  and international environmental laws  rules  and regulations 
these laws  rules  and regulations may affect the way we conduct our operations  and failure to comply with these regulations could lead to fines and other penalties 
we are also involved in the evaluation and clean up of a limited number of properties currently and previously owned 
management does not expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the european union eu adopted the following environmental directives waste electrical and electronic equipment weee and restriction on the use of hazardous substances rohs 
both directives are being transposed into legislation of the eu member states 
the weee directive mandates labeling  collection  and treatment of electrical and electronic equipment 
currently  we are in compliance with the labeling requirements of the weee directive  and are actively working with our european distributors to ensure compliance with the collection and recycling requirements 
the rohs directive bans the sale of electrical and electronic equipment containing certain hazardous substances  such as lead  mercury  chromium  cadmium  and brominated flame retardants 
we are working with our suppliers  engineers  and operations functions to ensure we will be in compliance with the rohs directive by the july  effective date 
our residential products are subject to various united states statutes designed to protect consumers and are subject to the administrative jurisdiction of the consumer product safety commission 
we are also subject to international  federal and state environmental  occupational safety  transportation  and other regulations  none of which has had a material adverse effect on our operations or business 
management believes we are in substantial compliance with all such regulations 
customer financing wholesale financing toro credit company  our wholly owned finance subsidiary  provides financing for select products we manufacture for north american toro distributors and approximately selected us dealers 
toro credit company purchases select receivables from us and our distributors for extended periods that assists the distributors and dealers to carry representative inventories of equipment 
down payments are not required and  depending on the finance program for each product line  finance charges are incurred by us  shared between us and the distributor and or the dealer  or paid by the distributor or dealer 
a security interest is retained in the distributors and dealers inventories  and periodic physical checks are made of those inventories 
generally  terms to the distributors and dealers require payment as the equipment  which secures the indebtedness  is sold to customers  or when payment terms become due  whichever occurs first 
rates are generally fixed or based on prime rate plus a fixed percentage that differs based on whether the financing is for a distributor or dealer 
rates may also vary based on the product that is financed 
independent toro dealers that do not finance through toro credit company finance their inventories with third party sources 
the finance charges represent interest for a pre established length of time based on a predefined rate by a contract with third party financing sources 
exmark and some international products sold through dealers are financed primarily with third party financing sources or by the distributor 
end user financing we have agreements with a third party financing company to provide lease financing options to golf course and sports fields and grounds equipment customers and agricultural irrigation customers in north america and europe 
the purpose of these agreements is to increase sales by giving buyers of our products alternative financing options when purchasing our products 
we also have a multi year agreement with a third party financing company to provide financing programs under a private label program in the us this program  offered primarily to toro and exmark dealers  provides end user customers a revolving line of credit for toro and exmark products  parts  and services 
distributor financing we enter into long term loan agreements with some distributors 
these transactions are used for expansion of the distributors businesses  acquisitions  refinancing working capital agreements  or ownership changes 
employees during fiscal  we employed an average of  employees 
the total number of employees as of october  was  three collective bargaining agreements cover approximately percent of these employees  each expiring in one of the following periods may  october  and october from time to time  we also retain consultants  independent contractors  and temporary and part time workers

item a 
risk factors the following are significant factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  or operating results 
risks relating to our business weather conditions may reduce demand for some of our products and adversely affect our net sales 
from time to time  weather conditions in a particular region or market may adversely affect sales of some of our products and field inventory levels 
for example  in the past  drought conditions have had an adverse effect on sales of certain mowing equipment products  unusually rainy weather has had an adverse effect on sales of our irrigation products  and lower snowfall accumulations have had an adverse effect on sales of our snow thrower products 
increases in the cost and availability of raw materials and components that we purchase and increases in our other costs of doing business  such as transportation costs  may adversely affect our profit margins and business 
we purchase raw materials  such as steel  fuel  petroleum based resins  and other commodities  and components  such as engines  transmissions  transaxles  hydraulics and electric motors  for use in our products 
increases in the cost of such raw materials and components may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any cost increases in the form of price increases or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold 
in the past  we have implemented lean manufacturing  other productivity improvement initiatives  and price increases on some of our products in an attempt to offset a portion of increased raw material and component costs 
however  we cannot commit that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
although most of the raw materials and components of our products are commercially available from a number of sources and in adequate supply  any disruption in the availability of such raw materials and components or any deterioration in our relationships with our suppliers could adversely affect our business 
increases in our other costs of doing business may also adversely affect our profit margins and business 
for example  an increase in fuel costs may also result in an increase in our transportation costs  which also could adversely affect our operating results and business 
our professional segment net sales are dependent upon the level of growth in the residential and commercial construction markets  growth of homeowners outsourcing lawn care  the amount of investment in golf course renovations and improvements  new golf course development  and the amount of government spending 
our professional segment products are sold by distributors  dealers  or directly to professional users engaged in maintaining and creating landscapes  such as golf courses  sports fields  municipal properties  and residential and commercial landscapes 
our professional segment net sales  therefore  are dependent upon the level of growth in residential and commercial construction markets  growth of homeowners outsourcing lawn care  the amount of investment in golf course renovations and improvements  new golf course construction  and the amount of government spending 
reduced tax revenue  increased expenses  and tighter government budgets generally result in reduced government spending for grounds maintenance equipment 
in addition  a slow rate of growth in golf rounds played that impacts revenue for golf courses could adversely affect our sales of golf course equipment and irrigation products 
our residential segment net sales are dependent upon the amount of shelf space retailers assign to our products  changing buying patterns of customers  and the home depot  inc as a major customer 
the elimination or reduction of shelf space assigned to our products by retailers could adversely affect our residential segment net sales 
our residential segment net sales are also dependent upon changing buying patterns of customers 
for example  in the last decade  there has been a trend away from purchases at dealer outlets and hardware retailers to price and value sensitive purchases at home centers and mass retailers 
this trend has resulted in a demand for residential products purchased at retailers with lower price points  such as the home depot  which accounted for a greater percentage of our net sales in the past few fiscal years compared to our net sales during and prior to the s 
the home depot accounted for greater than percent of our total consolidated net sales in fiscal   and while we believe that our diverse distribution channels and customer base should reduce the impact of the loss of the home depot or any other substantial customer  the loss of the home depot as a customer or any other substantial customer or a significant reduction in sales to the home depot or other customers  nonetheless  could have a material impact on our business and operating results 
changing buying patterns of customers also could result in reduced sales of one or more of our residential segment products resulting in increased inventory levels 
although our residential spring and summer products are generally manufactured throughout the year  our residential fall and winter products are generally manufactured in the summer and fall months 
our production levels and inventory management goals are based on estimates of demand for our products  taking into account production capacity  timing of shipments  and field inventory levels 
if we overestimate or underestimate demand during a given season  we may have excess or insufficient inventories 
a significant percentage of our consolidated net sales is generated outside of the united states  and we intend to continue to expand our international operations 
our international operations require significant management attention and financial resources  expose us to difficulties presented by international economic  political  legal  accounting  and business factors  and may not be successful or produce desired levels of net sales 
we manufacture our products in the united states  mexico  australia  the united kingdom  and italy for sale throughout the world and maintain sales offices in the united states  canada  belgium  the united kingdom  france  australia  singapore  japan  china  and italy 
our net sales outside the united states were percent  percent  and percent of our total consolidated net sales for fiscal   and  respectively 
one of our strategic objectives is to continue to expand our international business 
for example  in february  we completed the acquisition of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of hayter limited  a company located in the united kingdom that designs  manufactures  and markets residential and professional turf maintenance equipment  primarily for the united kingdom market 
the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources 
many of the countries in which we sell our products or otherwise have an international presence are  to some degree  subject to political  economic  and or social instability 
our international operations expose us and our representatives  agents  and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions 
these risks include increased costs of customizing products for foreign countries  difficulties in managing and staffing international operations and increased infrastructure costs including legal  tax  accounting  and information technology  the imposition of additional us and foreign governmental controls or regulations  new trade restrictions and restrictions on the activities of foreign agents  representatives  and distributors  and the imposition of costly and lengthy export licensing requirements and changes in duties and tariffs  license obligations  and other non tariff barriers to trade  the imposition of us and or international sanctions against a country  company  person  or entity with whom the company does business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country  company  person  or entity  international pricing pressures  laws and business practices favoring local companies  adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations  longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems  difficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights  and multiple  changing  and often inconsistent enforcement of laws and regulations 
our operations in other countries may not produce desired levels of net sales or that one or more of the factors listed above may harm our business 
any material decrease in our international sales could adversely impact our operating results 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported net sales and net earnings 
because the functional currency of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business  such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries as well as sales to third party customers  purchases from suppliers  and bank lines of credit with creditors denominated in foreign currencies 
our reported net sales and net earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
because our products are manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states  a stronger us dollar generally has a negative impact on results from operations outside the united states while a weaker dollar generally has a positive effect 
our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro  the japanese yen  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  the british pound  and the mexican peso against the us dollar 
while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency market risk in the normal course of business by entering into various foreign exchange contracts  these instruments may not limit our underlying exposure from currency fluctuations or minimize our net earnings and cash volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
in addition  our hedging activities also involve some risk 
we intend to grow our business through additional acquisitions  alliances  and joint venture arrangements  which are risky and could harm our business 
one of our growth strategies is to supplement our internal growth through acquisitions  alliances  and joint venture arrangements of businesses with technologies or products that complement or augment our existing products and or add new products to our business 
in february  we completed the acquisition of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of hayter limited in the united kingdom 
the benefits of an acquisition  alliance or joint venture may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations  and we cannot guarantee that our hayter acquisition or any future acquisitions  alliances or joint ventures will in fact produce any benefits 
in addition  acquisitions  alliances  and joint ventures involve a number of risks  including diversion of management s attention  difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies  cost savings  and revenue synergies  potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  adverse impact on overall profitability if acquired businesses do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models  reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and or an increase in our leverage and debt service requirements to pay the acquisition purchase prices  which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy  inaccurate assessment of undisclosed  contingent or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition  and incorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions  incurrence of non recurring charges  and write off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect our operating results 
our ability to grow through acquisitions will depend  in part  on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at an acceptable price  our ability to compete effectively for these acquisition candidates  and the availability of capital to complete such acquisitions 
these risks could be heightened if we complete several acquisitions within a relatively short period of time 
in addition  some acquisitions may require the consent of the lenders under our credit agreements 
we cannot predict whether such approvals would be forthcoming or the terms on which the lenders would approve such acquisitions 
any potential acquisition could impair our operating results 
if we are unable to smoothly transition leadership roles and responsibilities  retain our key employees and attract and retain other qualified personnel  we may not be able to meet strategic objectives and our business could suffer 
our ability to meet our strategic objectives and otherwise grow will depend to a significant extent on the continued contributions of our senior management team and the smooth transition of leadership from kendrick b 
melrose  our current executive chairman of the board and former chief executive officer  to michael j 
hoffman  our president and chief executive officer 
our future success will also depend in large part on our ability to identify  attract  and retain other highly qualified managerial  technical  sales and marketing  and customer service personnel 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not succeed in identifying  attracting  and or retaining these personnel 
the loss or interruption of services of any of our key personnel  the inability to identify  attract or retain qualified personnel in the future  delays in hiring qualified personnel  or any employee slowdowns  strikes or similar actions could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  which could harm our business  financial condition  and operating results 
we rely on our management information systems for inventory management  distribution  and other functions 
if our information systems fail to adequately perform these functions or if we experience an interruption in their operation  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems 
we rely on our management information systems to effectively manage accounting and financial functions  manage manufacturing and supply chain processes  and to maintain our research and development data 
the failure of our management information systems to perform properly could disrupt our business and product development and could result in decreased sales  increased overhead costs  excess inventory  and product shortages  causing our business and operating results to suffer 
in addition  our management information systems  including our computer systems  internet web sites  telecommunications  and data networks are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural or man made disasters  terrorist attacks and attacks by computer viruses or hackers  or power loss 
any such interruption could adversely affect our business and operating results 
a significant portion of our net sales are financed by third parties 
some toro dealers and exmark distributors and dealers finance their inventories with third party financing sources 
the termination of our agreements with these third parties  any material change to the terms of our agreements with these third parties or in the availability or terms of credit offered to our customers by these third parties  or any delay in securing replacement credit sources  could adversely affect our sales and operating results 
some toro dealers and exmark distributors and dealers generally finance their inventories with third party financing companies 
these third party financing companies purchase select receivables from us and our distributors and dealers for extended periods that assists our distributors and dealers in carrying representative inventories of our products 
we also have agreements with third party financing companies to provide financing options to golf course and sports fields and grounds equipment customers and agricultural irrigation customers in north america and europe 
the purpose of these agreements is to increase our net sales by giving buyers of our products alternative financing options when purchasing our products 
we also have an agreement with a third party financing company to provide financing programs under a private label program offered primarily to toro and exmark dealers that provides our end user customers a revolving line of credit for toro and exmark products  parts  and services 
termination of our agreements with these third parties  any material change to the terms of our agreements with these third parties or in the availability or terms of credit for our customers from these third parties or any delay in securing replacement credit sources  could adversely affect our operating results 
our reliance upon patents  trademark laws  and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from others who may sell similar products 
we hold patents relating to various aspects of our products and believe that proprietary technical know how is critical to many of our products 
proprietary rights relating to our products are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are maintained in confidence as trade secrets 
we cannot be certain that we will be issued any patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in the absence of patent protection  we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know how 
our competitors may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents  or they may use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe our patents 
we may incur substantial costs if our competitors initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents  or if we initiate any proceedings to protect our proprietary rights  and if the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
there may also be pending or issued patents held by parties not affiliated with us that relate to our products or technologies  and we may need to acquire licenses to any such patents to continue selling some or all of our products 
if we had to obtain any such license in order to be able to continue to sell some or all of our products  we may not be able to do so on terms that were favorable to us  if at all 
in addition  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how that we seek to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
even if these confidentiality agreements are not breached  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
we manufacture our products at and distribute our products from several locations in the united states and internationally 
any disruption at any of these facilities or our inability to cost effectively expand existing and move production between manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we manufacture most of our products at seven locations in the united states  two locations in mexico  and one location in each of australia  italy  and the united kingdom 
we also have several locations that serve as distribution centers  warehouses  test facilities  and corporate offices 
our facilities may be affected by natural or man made disasters 
in the event one of our manufacturing facilities was affected by a disaster  we could be forced to shift production to one of our other manufacturing facilities 
although we purchase insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties  such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses 
any disruption in our manufacturing capacity could have an adverse impact on our ability to produce sufficient inventory of our products or may require us to incur additional expenses in order to produce sufficient inventory  and therefore may adversely affect our net sales and operating results 
any disruption or delay at our manufacturing facilities  including a strike at any one of our three manufacturing facilities operating under a collective bargaining agreement or the failure to renew or enter into a new collective bargaining agreement  could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and our customers may cancel orders or purchase products from our competitors  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
our operating results may also be adversely affected if we are unable to cost effectively expand existing and move production between manufacturing facilities as needed from time to time 
our business is subject to a number of other miscellaneous risks that may adversely affect our operating results  financial condition or business 
other miscellaneous risks include changes in global and domestic economies  including but not limited to slow growth rate  slow down or reduction in home ownership  rise in interest rates  inflation  unemployment  and weakening consumer confidence  natural disasters  such as hurricanes  which may result in shortages of raw materials  higher fuel costs  and increase in insurance premiums  financial viability of some distributors and dealers  changes in distributor ownership  our success in partnering with new dealers  and our customers ability to pay amounts owed to us  and continued threat of terrorist acts and war  which may result in heightened security and higher costs for import and export shipments of components or finished goods  reduced leisure travel  and contraction of the us and worldwide economies 
risks relating to our industry if we are unable to continue to enhance existing products and develop and market new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance  we may experience a decrease in demand for our products  and our business could suffer 
one of our growth strategies is to continue to lead our industry in product innovation by enhancing existing products and by developing and marketing new products that respond to customer needs 
our sales from new products in the past have represented a significant component of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales 
we may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors unless we can keep up with existing or new products in the markets in which we compete 
product development requires significant financial and other resources 
although in the past we have implemented lean manufacturing and other productivity improvement initiatives to provide investment funding for new products  we cannot ensure that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
product improvements and new product introductions also require significant planning  design  development  and testing at the technological  product  and manufacturing process levels and we may not be able to timely develop product improvements or new products 
our competitors new products may beat our products to market  may be more effective with more features and or less expensive than our products or render our products obsolete 
any new products that we may develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations  based on  among other things  existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising  marketing  promotional programs  and research and development 
we face intense competition in all of our product lines  including some competitors that have greater resources than us 
we may not be able to compete effectively against competitors actions  which could harm our business and operating results 
our products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world 
principal competitive factors in our markets include pricing  product innovation  quality and reliability  product support and customer service  warranty  reputation  distribution  shelf space  and financing options 
we compete in all of our product lines with numerous manufacturers  some who have substantially greater financial  marketing  and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
in addition  competition could increase if new companies enter the market or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines 
our current products  products under development  and our ability to develop new and improved products may be insufficient to enable us to compete effectively with our competitors 
internationally  our residential segment products can face more competition where foreign competitors manufacture and market products in their respective countries 
we experience this competition primarily in europe and asia 
in addition  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price of our products in foreign markets  thereby impacting their competitiveness 
pricing has become an increasingly important competitive factor for a majority of our products 
we may not be able to compete effectively against competitors actions  which could harm our business and operating results 
our business  properties  and products are subject to governmental regulation with which compliance may require us to incur expenses or modify our products or operations and may expose us to penalties for non compliance 
governmental regulation may also adversely affect the demand for some of our products and our operating results 
our business  properties  and products are subject to a wide variety of international  federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  natural resources  and worker health and safety and the use  management  storage  and disposal of hazardous substances  wastes  and other regulated materials 
these laws  rules  and regulations may affect the way we conduct our operations  and the failure to comply with these regulations could lead to fines and other penalties 
because we own and operate real property  various environmental laws also may impose liability on us for the costs of cleaning up and responding to hazardous substances that may have been released on our property  including releases unknown to us 
these environmental laws and regulations also could require us to pay for environmental remediation and response costs at third party locations where we disposed of or recycled hazardous substances 
we are currently involved in the evaluation and clean up of a limited number of properties we either currently or previously owned 
although we do not expect that these current matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or operating results  our future costs of complying with the various environmental requirements  as they now exist or may be altered in the future  could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
we are also subject to other international  federal and state laws  rules and regulations  the future non compliance of which may harm our business or may adversely affect the demand for some of our products 
for example  our residential products are subject to various united states statutes designed to protect consumers and are subject to the administrative jurisdiction of the consumer product safety commission 
the european union also recently adopted environmental directives that mandate the labeling  collection  and treatment of electrical and electronic equipment and bans the sale of electrical and electronic equipment containing certain hazardous substances 
in addition  governmental restrictions placed on water usage as well as water availability may adversely affect demand for our irrigation products 
changes in laws and regulations  including changes in accounting standards  taxation changes  including tax rate changes  new tax laws  revised tax law interpretations  also may adversely affect our operating results 
we are subject to product liability claims  product quality issues  and other litigation from time to time that could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 
the manufacture and sale of our products expose us to significant risk of product liability claims 
if a product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage and it is ultimately determined that we are liable  our business could suffer 
while we instruct our customers on the proper usage of our products  we cannot ensure that they will implement our instructions accurately 
if our products are used incorrectly by our customers  injury may result and this could give rise to product liability claims against us 
any losses that we may suffer from any liability claims  and the effect that any product liability litigation may have upon the reputation and marketability of our products  may divert management s attention from other matters and may have a negative impact on our business and operating results 
some of our products or product improvements were developed relatively recently and defects or risks that we have not yet identified may give rise to product liability claims 
additionally  we could experience a material design or manufacturing failure in our products  a quality system failure  other safety issues or heightened regulatory scrutiny that could warrant a recall of some of our products 
a recall of some of our products could also result in increased product liability claims 
unforeseen product quality problems in the development and production of new and existing products could also result in loss of market share  reduced sales  and higher warranty expense 
we are also subject to other litigation from time to time that could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 
for example  we are currently one of eight defendants in a purported class action in which the plaintiffs are alleging that the horsepower labels on the products the plaintiffs purchased were inaccurate 
the complaint seeks an injunction  unspecified compensatory and punitive damages  and attorneys fees 
even if the plaintiff s claims are found to be without merit  we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial costs in defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could divert the time and attention of our management and could result in adverse publicity  either of which could significantly harm our operating results and financial condition 
any adverse determination in the litigation could also result in material liability  which could harm our operating results and financial condition 
item properties as of october   we utilized manufacturing  distribution  warehouse  and office facilities totaling approximately million square feet of space  which also included inactive facilities totaling approximately million of square feet available for sale or subleasing 
we also utilize acres of land in california as a testing facility  acres of land in nebraska as a parking and testing facility  and acres of land in minnesota as a testing and storage facility 
plant utilization varies during the year depending on the production cycle 
we consider each of our current facilities in use to be in good operating condition and adequate for its present use 
management believes we have sufficient manufacturing capacity for fiscal the following schedule outlines our significant facilities by location  ownership  and function as of october  location ownership products manufactured use bloomington  mn owned leased corporate headquarters  warehouse  and test facility el paso  tx owned leased components for professional and residential products  distribution center juarez  mexico leased professional and residential products plymouth  wi owned professional and residential parts distribution center tomah  wi owned leased professional products and warehouse windom  mn owned leased residential and professional products and warehouse baraboo  wi leased professional and residential finished goods distribution center beatrice  ne owned professional products  office  and test facility riverside  ca owned leased office and test facility lakeville  mn leased residential finished goods distribution center lincoln  ne leased professional products warehouse hertfordshire  united kingdom owned professional and residential products and warehouse  office shakopee  mn owned components for professional and residential products beverley  australia owned professional products  office and finished goods distribution center el cajon  ca owned professional and residential products and warehouse  office brooklyn center  mn leased distribution facility capena  italy leased distribution facility oevel  belgium owned distribution facility hazelwood  mo leased distribution facility braeside  australia leased distribution facility sandford  fl leased professional products itasca  il leased distribution facility item legal proceedings we are party to litigation in the ordinary course of business 
litigation occasionally involves claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages arising out of use of our products 
we are also subject to administrative proceedings with respect to claims involving the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment 
some of these claims assert damages and liability for remedial investigations and clean up costs 
we are also typically involved in commercial disputes  employment disputes  and patent litigation cases in the ordinary course of business  both as a plaintiff and as a defendant 
while the ultimate results of the current cases are unknown at this time  management believes that the outcome of these cases is unlikely to have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 
further  we maintain insurance against some product liability losses 
on june   eight individuals who claim to have purchased lawnmowers in illinois and minnesota filed a lawsuit ronnie phillips et al 
v 
sears roebuck corporation et 
al  no 
l th judicial circuit  st 
clair county  il against the company and eight other defendants alleging that the horsepower labels on the products the plaintiffs purchased were inaccurate 
the plaintiffs seek certification of a class of all persons in the united states who  beginning january  through the present  purchased a lawnmower containing a two stroke or four stroke gas combustible engine up to horsepower that was manufactured or sold by the defendants 
the complaint seeks an injunction  unspecified compensatory and punitive damages  and attorneys fees 
no answers have been entered in the case  and there has been no formal discovery 
a number of procedural motions have been filed by the defendants  but have not yet been decided 
on april   the court issued a stay of discovery and procedural matters to permit the parties to engage in settlement discussions 
an attempt at mediation in october was unsuccessful  and the company expects the stay of discovery to be lifted so that various procedural motions may be determined 
management continues to evaluate this lawsuit and is unable to reasonably estimate the likelihood of loss or the amount or range of potential loss that could result from this litigation 
therefore  an accrual has not been established for any potential loss in connection with this lawsuit 
the company is also unable to assess at this time whether the lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on its annual consolidated operating results or financial condition  although an unfavorable resolution could be material to the company s operating results for a particular period

these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview the toro company is in the business of designing  manufacturing  and marketing professional turf maintenance equipment and services  turf and micro irrigation systems  landscaping equipment  and residential yard products worldwide 
our products are sold through a network of distributors  dealers  hardware retailers  home centers  mass retailers  and over the internet  mainly through internet retailers 
our businesses are organized into two segments professional and residential 
a third segment called other consists of domestic distribution companies and corporate activities 
our emphasis is to provide well built  dependable  and innovative products supported by an extensive service network 
a significant portion of our revenues has historically been attributable to new and enhanced products 
financial overview fiscal was another strong year with net sales growth of percent and a double digit net earnings growth rate of percent 
diluted net earnings per share also increased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal our after tax return on net sales rose to percent from percent for fiscal sales of most of our product lines were up mainly as a result of successful new products introduced within the past two years  the acquisition of hayter limited  strong international demand  select price increases  and favorable foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  net sales by segment and the related percent change from the prior fiscal year 
dollars in thousands fiscal years ended october vs 
change professional residential other total net sales our financial condition remains strong with continued emphasis on asset management 
this has allowed us to reinvest in product development  brand building  and new technologies 
we doubled our fiscal quarterly cash dividend from the quarterly cash dividend paid in fiscal and recently increased our first quarter of fiscal quarterly cash dividend by percent from the quarterly dividend paid in the first quarter of fiscal we also continued to repurchase shares of our common stock during fiscal  which has reduced the number of our shares outstanding 
this reduction has resulted in an increase of approximately per diluted share in fiscal compared to fiscal on march   our board of directors declared a two for one stock split of our common stock  effected in the form of a percent stock dividend paid on april  as a result of this action  approximately million shares were issued to stockholders of record as of march  this was the second stock split in the past three fiscal years 
all references to the number of common shares and per common share amounts have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the stock split for all periods presented 
overall  fiscal was a good year and we believe we are in a position for yet another good year in fiscal key drivers for our anticipated growth in fiscal will be the continued success of our product innovation  increased emphasis on growing our international business  developing integrated services with our product offering  focusing on markets that are underserved by our brands  and adapting to an ever changing competitive marketplace by becoming a solutions provider 
however  we will continue to keep a cautionary eye on the weather  world economies  field inventory levels  commodity prices  and other factors identified under the caption risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k  which could cause our actual results to differ from our outlook 
acquisition on february   we completed the acquisition of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of hayter limited hayter 
hayter designs  manufactures  and markets residential and professional turf maintenance equipment primarily for the united kingdom market  with annual sales of approximately million 
the acquisition of hayter contributed percent of our percent net sales growth for fiscal initiative accelerating our future fiscal was the second year of our teamwork to the top initiative to achieve a consistent after tax return on sales of percent or more and grow revenues at an average annual rate of percent or more over the three year period ending october  we have mobilized our global workforce to employ new tools and disciplines that are intended to drive innovation  eliminate waste  and add sustainable value 
the focus areas of this initiative are lean no waste 
the same lean methods and principles that are delivering measurable improvements in efficiency and profitability in our manufacturing environment are also being employed in our office environments to streamline work and eliminate waste 
project teams are forming throughout the organization to assess existing processes  increase cross functional collaboration  and eliminate unnecessary steps that have little value
