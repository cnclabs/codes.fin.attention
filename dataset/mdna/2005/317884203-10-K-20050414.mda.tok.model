the burdines departments have been accounted for as a discontinued operation  and  unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to our continuing operations 
executive overview our business we are one of the leading retailers of fine jewelry in the united states and operate licensed fine jewelry departments in major department stores for retailers such as may and federated 
we sell a broad selection of moderately priced jewelry  with an average sales price of approximately per item 
as of january   we operated locations in host store groups  in states and the district of columbia 
our primary focus is to offer desirable and competitively priced products  a breadth of merchandise assortments and to provide superior customer service 
our ability to quickly identify emerging trends and maintain strong relationships with vendors has enabled us to present better assortments in our showcases 
we believe that we are an important contributor to each of our host store groups and we continue to seek opportunities to penetrate the department store segment 
by outsourcing their fine jewelry departments to us  host store groups gain our expertise in merchandising  selling and marketing jewelry and customer service 
additionally  by avoiding high working capital investments typically required of the traditional retail jewelry business  host stores improve their return on investment and increase their profitability 
as a licensee  we benefit from the host stores reputation  customer traffic  credit services and established customer base 
we also avoid the substantial capital investment in fixed assets typical of a stand alone retail format 
in recent years  on average  approximately of our merchandise has been carried on consignment  which reduces our inventory exposure to changing fashion trends 
these factors have generally led our new departments to achieve profitability within the first twelve months of operation 
we measure ourselves against key financial measures that we believe provid e a well balanced perspective regarding our overall financial success 
those benchmarks are as follows  together with how they are computed o diluted earnings per share eps net income divided by weighted average shares outstanding and share equivalents included to the extent they are dilutive which is an indicator of the returns generated for our shareholders  o comparable department sales growth computed as the percentage change in sales for departments open for the same months during the comparable periods 
comparable department sales are measured against our host store groups as well as other jewelry retailers  o total net sales growth current year total net sales minus prior year total net sales divided by prior year total net sales equals percentage change which indicates  among other things  the success o f our selection of new store locations and the effectiveness of our merchandising strategies  and o operating margin rate income from operations divided by net sales which is an indicator of our success in leveraging our fixed costs an d managing our variable costs 
key components of income from operations which management focuses on include monitoring gross margin levels as well as continued emphasis on leveraging our sg a 
highlights during  we successfully executed our marketing and merchandising strategy  as evidenced by our growth in comparable department sales  achieved strong operating cash flow and increased profitability 
over the past decade  we have experienced comparable store sales increases in nine out of te n years and we have consistently outperformed our host store groups with respect to these increases 
we attribute our success to an experienced and stable management team  a well trained and highly motivated sales force  an expert jewelry merchandising team  unique vendor relationships and an established customer base 
also contributing to our success are our merchandising and inventory control system and point of sale system for our departments which provide the foundation for improved productivity 
total sales were million in compared to million in  an increase of 
gross margin increased by million in compared to  and as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased by from to 
although sg a increased by million  as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased from to 
during  we effectively managed our inventories and implemented appropriate expense controls 
we ended with million of cash compared to million at the end of this decrease related primarily to the reduction of long term debt as a result of the refinancing of the senior debentures and the senior notes as well as fees and expenses related to the transaction 
our operating cash flow was million in  which enabled u s to open new departments  remodel and expand existing departments and repurchase stock 
additionally  borrowings under the revolving credit agreement were reduced to zero by the end of december the average outstanding balance increased to million as compared to million in the prior year  primarily as a result of the refinancing of the senior debentures and the senio r notes 
these transactions  together with the issuance of the new senior notes  were undertaken to decrease our overall interest rate  extend our debt maturities and decrease total long term debt as well as simplify our capital structure by eliminating debt at the parent company level 
lastly  maximum outstanding borrowings during peaked at million  at which point the available borrowings under the revolving credit agreement were an additional million 
opportunities we believe that current trends in jewelry retailing provide a significant opportunity for our growth 
consumers spent approximately billion on jewelry including both fine jewelry and costume jewelry in the united states in calendar year  an increase of approximately billion over  according to the united states department of commerce 
in the department store sector in which we operate  consumers spent an estimated billion on fine jewelry in calendar year our management believes that demographic factors such as the maturing us population and an increase in the number of working women  have resulted in greater disposable income  thus contributing to the growth of the fine jewelry retailing industry 
our management also believes tha t jewelry consumers today increasingly perceive fine jewelry as a fashion accessory  resulting in purchases which augment our gift and special occasion sales 
an important initiative and focus of management is developing opportunitie s for our growth 
we consider it a high priority to identify new businesses that offer growth  financial viability and manageability and will have a positive impact on shareholder value 
on march   the company announced that it is in advanced discussions regarding a possible acquisition of carlyle 
carlyle is a privately owned regional chain  located primarily in the southeastern united states  with jewelry stores and annual sales of approximately million 
finlay is presently engaged in its due diligence review of carlyle 
in  the company tested moissanite merchandise moissanite is a lab created stone with greater brilliance and luster than a diamond in certain departments 
this new category of merchandise will be expanded to additional departments in and is estimated to generate sales of million 
additional growth opportunities exist with respect to opening departments within existing host store groups that do not currently operate jewelry departments 
such opportunities exist within dillard s and belk s 
during and  we added a total of new departments in dillard s and belks and pla n to add a total of seven departments within these host store groups during in november  we began a relationship with smartbargains to provide jewelry via its internet site and absorbed this e business fulfillment into our distribution center 
sales generated via this internet business during totaled approximately million 
we will continue to seek to identify complementary businesses to leverage our core competencies in the jewelry industry 
we continue to seek growth opportunities and plan to continue to pursue th e following key initiatives to further increase sales and earnings o increase comparable department sales  o add departments within existing host store groups  o expansion of our most productive departments  o identify and acquire new businesses  o open new channels of distribution  o introduction of new fashion trends  o add new host store relationships  o continue to raise customer service standards  o strengthen selling teams through training programs  o continue to improve operating leverage  o de leverage the balance sheet  and o continue our stock repurchase program 
see business growth strategy and management s discussion and analysis o f financial condition and results of operations 
risks and uncertainties we achieved sustained growth during  however  we have faced certain challenges as well  including o host store consolidation  and o dependence on or loss of certain host store relationships 
during  approximately including marshall field s for the fiscal year and of our sales were generated by departments operated in store groups owned by may and federated  respectively 
we have operated departments with may since and with federated since we believe that our relationships with these host stores are excellent 
nevertheless  a decisio n by either company  or certain of our host store groups  to terminate existing relationships  to assume the operation of those departments themselves  or to close significant number of stores would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
on february   federated and may announced that they have entered into a merger agreement whereby federated would acquire may 
the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of the completion of the merger is contingent upon regulatory review and approval by the shareholders of both companies

as a result of federated s decision not to renew our license agreement in its burdines department store division in due to the consolidation of the burdines and macy s fine jewelry departments  we closed burdines departments in january these departments generated approximately million in revenue during during  may announced its intention to close certain of its smaller  less profitable stores  including lord taylor stores  as well as two store s in its famous barr division  resulting in the closure of departments in which generated approximately million in sales

accordingly  we experience seasonal cash needs as inventory levels peak 
additionally  substantially all of our license agreement s provide for accelerated payments during the months of november and december  which require the host store groups to remit to us of the estimated months sales prior to or shortly following the end of that month

in the past  a significant amount of our operating cash flow has been use d to pay interest with respect to the senior debentures  the senior notes and amounts due under the revolving credit agreement  including the payments required pursuant to the balance reduction requirement 
although the senior debentures and the senior notes are no longer outstanding as a result of the refinancing  a significant amount of our operating cash flow will still be required to pay interest with respect to the new senior notes and amounts due under the revolving credit agreement  including payments required under the balance reduction requirement

as of and for the year ended january   we are in compliance with all of our covenants 
we expect to be in compliance with all of our covenants through because compliance is based  in part  on our management s estimates and actual results can differ fro m those estimates  there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with the covenants in the future or that the lenders will waive or amend any of the covenants should we be in violation thereof

we believe that  based upon current operations  anticipated growth and continued availability under the revolving credit agreement  finlay jewelry will  for the foreseeable future  be able to meet its debt service and anticipated working capital obligations and to make distributions sufficient to permit us to pay certain expenses as they come due 
no assurances  however  can be given that finlay jewelry s current level of operating results will continue or improve or that finlay jewelry s income from operations will continue to be sufficient to permit finlay jewelry to meet its debt service and other obligations 
currently  finlay jewelry s principal financing arrangements restrict the amount of annual distributions  including those required to fund stock repurchases  from finlay jewelry to us 
the amounts required to satisfy the aggregate of finlay jewelry s interest expense totaled million and million in and  respectively 
our long term needs for external financing will depend on our rate of growth  the level of internally generated funds and the ability to continue obtaining substantial amounts of merchandise on advantageous terms  including consignment arrangements with our vendors

the new employment agreement provides an annual salary level of approximately million as well as incentive compensation based on meeting specific financial goals  which are not yet determinable 
from time to time  we enter into forward contracts based upon the anticipated sales of gold product in order to hedge against the risk arising from our payment arrangements

there can be no assurance that these hedging techniques will be successful or that hedging transactions will not adversely affect our results of operations or financial position

the fourth quarter accounted for an average of approximately of our sales and approximately of our income from operations for and we have typically experienced net losses in the first three quarters of our fiscal year 
during these periods  working capital requirements have been funded by borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
accordingly  the results for any of the first three quarters of any given fiscal year  taken individually or in the aggregate  are not indicative o f annual results

inflation the effect of inflation on our results of operations has not been material in the periods discussed 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly re evaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
however  since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  actual results may differ from our estimates  and such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
a summary of our significant accounting policies and a description o f accounting policies that we believe are most critical may be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
the cost is determined by the lifo method utilizing an internally generated index 
factors related to inventories  such as future consumer demand and the economy s impact on consumer discretionary spending  inventory aging  ability to return merchandise to vendors  merchandise condition and anticipated markdowns  are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values 
an adjustment is recorde d to reduce the lifo cost of inventories  if required 
any significant unanticipated changes in the factors above could have a significant impact on the value of the inventories and our reported operating results 
shrinkage is estimated for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal year on a store by store basis 
the shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory  in combination with historical experience  is the basis for estimating shrinkage 
vendor allowances we receive allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including cooperative advertising 
vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales upon the sale of merchandise or sg a when the purpose for which the vendor funds were intended to be used has been fulfilled 
accordingly  a reduction or increase in vendor allowances has an inverse impact on cost of sales and or sg a 
finite lived assets finite lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may no t be recoverable 
if the undiscounted future cash flows from the finite lived assets are less than the carrying value  we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets 
we determine the fair value of the underlying assets based upon the discounted future cash flows of the assets 
various factors  including future sales growth and profit margins  are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or our strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events and change s in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from our estimated future cash flows 
to the extent these future cash flows or our strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from current estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon the sale of merchandise  either owned or consigned  to our customers  net of anticipated returns 
the provision for sale s returns is based on our historical return rate 
self insurance reserves we are self insured for medical and workers compensation claims up to certain maximum liability amounts 
although the amounts accrued are determined based on analysis of historical trends of losses  settlements  litigation costs and other factors  the amounts that we will ultimately disburse could differ materially from the accrued amounts 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions and must first determine which revenues and expenses should be included in each taxing jurisdiction 
this process involves the estimation of our actual current tax exposure  together with the assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of income or expense items for tax and accounting purposes 
we establish tax reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimation of current tax exposures 
if we prevail in tax matters for which reserves have been established or if we are required to settle matters in exces s of established reserves  the effective tax rate for a particular period could b e materially affected 
recent accounting pronouncement in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based paymen t transactions 
sfas r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed 
currently  only certain pro forma disclosures of fair value are required 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the firs t annual or interim period beginning after june  we will adopt sfas r prospectively on july   the beginning of our third fiscal quarter 
although we are in the process of determining the impact of this statement on our results of operations  the historical impact under sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
forward looking information and risk factors that may affect future results this form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
all statements other than statements of historical information provided herein are forward looking statements and may contain information about financial results  economic conditions  trends and known uncertainties 
the forward looking statements contained herein are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performances or achievements to differ materially from those reflected in  or implied by  the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition an d results of operations 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to our sales depend upon our host store relationships 
the loss of relationships with may or federated  or significant store closures by our host store groups  could materially adversely affect our business 
the impact of the recently announced planned merger of may and federated is unknown 
a decision by them  or certain of our other host store groups  to terminate existing relationships  transfer the operation of some or all of thei r departments to a competitor  assume the operation of those departments themselves  or close a significant number of stores  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
during  approximately of our sales were generated by departments operated in store groups owned by may and federated 
seasonality of the retail jewelry business and fluctuations in our quarterly results could adversely affect our profitability 
our business is highly seasonal  with a significant portion of our sales and income from operations generated during the fourth quarter of each year  which includes the year end holiday season 
the fourth quarter of accounte d for of our sales and of our operating income 
we have typically experienced net losses in the first three quarters of our fiscal year 
during these periods  working capital requirements have been funded by borrowings unde r our revolving credit facility 
this pattern is expected to continue 
a substantial decrease in sales during the fourth quarter  whether resulting from adverse weather conditions  natural disasters or any other cause  would have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
our departments are heavily dependent on customer traffic and the continued popularity of our host stores and malls 
the success of our departments depends  in part  on the ability of host stores to generate consumer traffic in their stores  and the continuing popularity of malls and department stores as shopping destinations 
sales volum e and customer traffic may be adversely affected by economic slowdowns in a particular geographic area  the closing of anchor tenants  or competition from retailers such as discount and mass merchandise stores and other department stores where we do not have departments 
we may not be able to successfully identify  finance  integrate or make acquisitions outside of the licensed jewelry department business 
we may from time to time examine opportunities to acquire or invest in companies or businesses that complement our existing core business 
there can b e no assurance that future acquisitions by us will be successful or improve our operating results 
in addition  our ability to complete acquisitions will depen d on the availability of both suitable target businesses and acceptable financing any future acquisitions may result in a potentially dilutive issuance of additional equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt or increased working capital requirements 
such acquisitions could involve numerous additional risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  products  services and personnel of any acquired company  diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  and expansion into new businesses with which we may have no prior experience 
our profitability depends  in part  upon our ability to continue to obtain substantial amounts of merchandise on consignment and on finlay jewelry s ability to continue its gold consignment agreement 
in recent years  on average  approximately of our merchandise has been obtained on consignment 
the willingness of vendors to enter into such arrangements may vary substantially from time to time based on a number of factors  including the merchandise involved  the financial resources of vendors interest rates  availability of financing  fluctuations in gem and gold prices  inflation  our financial condition and a number of other economic or competitiv e conditions in the jewelry business or generally 
in addition  finlay jewelry s gold consignment agreement allows us to receive consignment merchandise by providing gold  or otherwise making payment  to certain vendors 
as the price o f gold increases  the amount of consigned gold that is available to us is reduced pursuant to the limitations of the gold consignment agreement 
although finlay jewelry expects to renew the gold consignment agreement upon its expiration on july   there can be no assurances that such renewal will actually occur if the agreement is not renewed or replaced  our ability to receive gold merchandise on consignment through such an arrangement and on favorable terms may be materially adversely affected 
additionally  in the event that this agreement is terminated  finlay jewelry would be required to return the gold or purchase the outstanding gold at the prevailing  and potentially higher  gold price in effect on that date 
terrorist attacks  acts of war  or other factors affecting discretionary consumer spending may adversely affect our industry  our operations and our profitability 
terrorist activities  armed hostilities and other political instability  as well as a decline in general economic conditions  including the country s financial markets  a decline in consumer credit availability  or increases in prevailing interest rates  could materially reduce discretionary consumer spending particularly with respect to luxury items and  therefore  materially adversely affect our business and financial condition  especially if such changes were to occur in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
volatility in the availability and cost of precious metals and precious and semi precious stones could adversely affect our business 
the jewelry industry in general is affected by fluctuations in the price s of precious metals and precious and semi precious stones 
the availability and prices of gold  diamonds and other precious metals and precious and semi precious stones may be influenced by cartels  political instability in exporting countries and inflation 
shortages of these materials or sharp change s in their prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
although we attempt to protect against such fluctuations in the price of gold by entering into gold forward contracts  ther e can be no assurance that these hedging practices will be successful or that hedging transactions will no t adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
the retail jewelry business is highly competitive 
we face competition for retail jewelry sales from national and regional jewelry chains  other department stores  local independently owned jewelry stores and chains  specialty stores  mass merchandisers  catalog showrooms  discounters  direct mail suppliers  internet merchants and televised home shopping 
some of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than our business 
we may not be able to collect proceeds from our host stores 
our license agreements typically require the host stores to remit the ne t sales proceeds for each month to us approximately three weeks after the end of such month 
however  we cannot assure you that we will timely collect the net sales proceeds due to us from our host stores 
if one or more host stores fail to remit the net sales proceeds for a substantial period of time or during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year due to financial instability  insolvency or otherwise  this could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
we are dependent on several key vendors and other suppliers 
in  merchandise obtained by us from our five largest vendors generated approximately of sales  and merchandise obtained from our largest vendor generated approximately of sales 
there can be no assurances that we can identify  on a timely basis  alternate sources of merchandise supply in the case of an abrupt loss of any of our significant suppliers 
our success depends on our ability to identify and rapidly respond to fashion trends 
the jewelry industry is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and shifting consumer demands 
accordingly  our success depends on the priority tha t our target customers place on fashion and our ability to anticipate  identify and capitalize upon emerging fashion trends 
we may not be able to successfully expand our business or increase the number of departments we operate 
a significant portion of our growth in sales and income from operations in recent years has resulted from our ability to obtain licenses to operate departments in new host store groups and the addition of new departments in existing host store groups 
we cannot predict the number of departments we will operate in the future or whether our expansion  if any  will be at levels comparable to that experienced to date 
in a few cases  we are subject to limitations under our license agreements which prohibit us from operating departments for competing host store groups within a certain geographical radiu s of the host stores typically five to ten miles without the host store s permission 
such limitations restrict us from further expansion within areas where we currently operate departments  including expansion through possible acquisitions 
if we cannot obtain required consents  we will be limited in our ability to expand further in areas near our existing host stores 
we could be materially adversely affected if our distribution operations are disrupted 
we operate a central distribution facility and we do not have other facilities to support our distribution needs 
as a result  if this distribution facility were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason  we could incur higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of merchandise to our stores during the time it takes to reope n or replace the facility 
we are heavily dependent on our management information systems 
the efficient operation of our business is heavily dependent on our fully integrated management information systems 
in particular  we rely on our inventory and merchandising control system  which allows us to make better decisions in the allocation and distribution of our merchandise 
our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected if our systems were inoperable or inaccessible or if we were not able  for any reason  to successfully restore our systems and fully execute our disaster recovery plan 
we depend on key personnel 
our success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to retain key personnel  particularly arthur e 
reiner  our chairman and chief executive officer 
the loss of mr 
reiner s services or one or more of our current member s of senior management  or our failure to attract talented new employees  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our substantial debt and debt service requirements could adversely affec t our business 
we currently have a significant amount of debt 
as of january   we had million of debt outstanding not including million in letters of credit under our million revolving credit facility 
in  our average revolver balance was million and we peaked in usage at million 
in addition  as of january   the value of gold outstanding under the gold consignment agreement totaled million 
subject to the term s of our indebtedness  we may incur additional indebtedness  including secured debt  in the future 
the terms of our debt instruments and other obligations impose financial and operating restrictions 
the revolving credit agreement  gold consignment agreement and the indenture relating to the new senior notes contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term bes t interests 
these covenants include limitations on  or relating to  capital expenditures  liens  indebtedness  investments  mergers  acquisitions  affiliated transactions  management compensation and the payment of dividends and other restricted payments 
the future impact of legal and regulatory issues is unknown 
our business is subject to government laws and regulations including  bu t not limited to  employment laws and regulations  state advertising regulations  quality standards imposed by federal law  and other laws and regulations 
a violation or change of these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the futur e impact of litigation arising in the ordinary course of business may have an adverse effect on the financial results or reputation of the company 
readers are cautioned not to rely on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis  judgment  belief or expectation only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
in addition to the disclosure contained herein  readers should carefully review an y disclosure of risks and uncertainties contained in other documents we file or have filed from time to time with the securities and exchange commission the commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk through the interest rate on our borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  which has a variable interest rate 
based on the average amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement for  a basis point change in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately million in in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage exposures through our regular operating and financing activities 
in addition  the majority of our borrowings are under fixed rate arrangements  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
commodity risk we enter into forward contracts for the purchase of the majority of our gold in order to hedge the risk of gold price fluctuations 
as of january   we had several open positions in gold forward contracts totaling  fine troy ounces  to purchase gold for million 
the fair value of gold under such contracts was million at january  these contracts hav e settlement dates ranging from march  to september
