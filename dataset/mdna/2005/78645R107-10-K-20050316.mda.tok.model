overview we develop  market  sell and support a portfolio of hardware and software network security products and services 
our products and services are used to create secure wans and vpns to prevent security breaches that could result in unauthorized access to confidential data  invasion of privacy and financial loss 
we have two reportable business segments 
through our enterprise security division  we sell high performance security solutions to address the needs of our government  financial institution and other security sensitive commercial customers 
we also provide  through our embedded security division  a broad range of network security products  including silicon chips  accelerator cards  licensed intellectual property and software products  to oems that embed them in their own network infrastructure and wireless products 
these divisions are managed separately because they offer different products and employ different marketing strategies see note to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
we periodically review and consider possible acquisitions of companies that we believe will contribute to our long term objectives and discuss such acquisitions with the management of those companies 
such acquisitions  which may be material  may be made from time to time 
in january  we acquired pijnenburg securealink  inc  a delaware corporation primarily engaged in the manufacture of security chips for e commerce transactions through its european subsidiary 
securealink develops  markets and sells security chips and intellectual property  primarily in europe and asia 
as a result of the acquisition  we broadened our market with the addition of new technologies and a larger presence in europe 
we integrated the operations of securealink into our embedded security division 
in february  our management decided to discontinue our swiss subsidiary operations at gds  which was formerly our european operations segment see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
the decision to discontinue gds s operations was based on the amount of its operating and cash losses during and  as well as a significant downturn in its future business prospects 
we transferred certain employees from gds s sales and marketing group to our sales group to create a european sales office focused on selling our enterprise products and services in europe 
the operating results of the discontinued businesses has been reported in the discontinued operations section of the consolidated statements of operations 
in february  we acquired cylink corporation  which expanded our customer base and our product offerings to include security solutions for wans 
operations of cylink were integrated into the enterprise security division 
in february  we also acquired the assets of raqia networks  inc  a development stage company that was developing content inspection technology 
this transaction consisted primarily of technology related intangible assets 
in november  we acquired substantially all of the assets and properties used in connection with the toolkit  ipvia vpn and vpn client businesses of ssh for approximately million in cash 
ssh is a world leading supplier of managed security middleware 
in march  we completed the acquisition of rainbow 
rainbow provided information security solutions for mission critical data and applications used in business  organization  and government computing environments 
this merger with rainbow has had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operations going forward 
in october  we acquired datakey  which expanded our customer base and product offerings to include token based solutions that simplify enterprise wide access and identity management 
operations of datakey are in the process of being merged into our enterprise security division 
our historical operating results have been dependent on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the length of the sales cycle  the timing of orders from and shipments to clients  product development expenses and the timing of development and introduction of new products 
our expense levels are based  in part  on expectations of future revenues 
the size and timing of our historical revenues have varied substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year 
accordingly  the results of a particular period  or period to period comparisons of recorded sales and profits may not be indicative of future operating results 
results of operations of safenet the following table sets forth certain of our consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december revenues cost of revenues gross profit research and development expenses sales and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses costs of integration of acquired companies write off of in process research and development restructuring charge amortization of intangibles amortization of deferred compensation total operating expenses operating income loss investment income and other expenses  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income loss from continuing operations the company has two reportable segments products  chips and software designed and manufactured for sale to companies that will embed the company s products into their products for ultimate sale to end users embedded security division  and network security products designed and manufactured for direct sales to end users and remote access software sold to oem s enterprise security division 
the segments are strategic business units that offer different products 
the segments are managed separately because each segment requires different technology and marketing strategies see note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues and gross margins variance dollars in thousands revenues by type license and royalties products service and maintenance total revenues by segment embedded security division enterprise security division total revenue mix by type license and royalties products service and maintenance total revenue mix by segment embedded security division enterprise security division total gross margins by type license and royalties products service and maintenance total gross margins by segment embedded security division enterprise security division total includes amortization of acquired intangibles  and  for and  respectively and amortization of unearned compensation in  in 
revenues increased million primarily due to increased product offerings that stemmed from acquisitions  primarily the rainbow acquisition 
revenue from those product offerings accounted for million of the increased revenue  including the related service and maintenance revenue 
license and royalties decreased due to several one time sales in  specifically  the execution of six new license arrangements that accounted for million in revenue 
there were also million of new intellectual property licenses during these sales were not repeated in service and maintenance revenue increased due to several acquired maintenance contracts from the rainbow transaction 
revenue increases by segment for the year ended december  over the year ended december  are reflective of several factors 
the embedded security division added million of revenue from product offerings acquired in business combinations during that were not available in revenues earned by the enterprise security division increased million  due primarily to acquired product offerings million 
the revenue mix by type has changed significantly as the company s acquisitions were product based companies  particularly rainbow technologies with a product and service mix  historically 
our integrated product and service offerings will continue to offer growth in all three revenue types but we will remain a product based company 
these products include hardware  appliances  and customized products 
the revenue mix by segment should continue to be materially consistent with the most recent quarter  with the embedded security division representing to of total revenues and the enterprise security division representing the remainder 
gross margins for each type of revenue fluctuated for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the fluctuation in product margin was due to the secure communications business  which carries margins in the to range and represents over of the revenues for the current period 
the products and services comprising the remaining portion of the revenue base earn average margins from to over 
the gross margins by segment are reflective of changes within each division 
the embedded security division s gross margins as well as the enterprise security division s gross margins decreased because of the increase in product revenues over other revenue streams 
product revenues are much lower margin sales than service and maintenance  licenses  or royalties 
both divisions have become primarily product based business driving down margins 
the enterprise security division s gross margins will fluctuate based on the mix of revenues from sales of secure communications products during the applicable reporting period 
operating expenses variance dollars in thousands operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative write off of acquired in process research and development costs cost of integration of acquired companies restructuring charge amortization of intangible assets amortization of unearned compensation total research and development expenses rose due to the increase in the number of ongoing technology projects within the company as well as the increase in the number of research and development team employees 
the company has added personnel through several acquisitions in the last to months  including cylink  raqia  ssh  rainbow and datakey 
for  the company added personnel from cylink and raqia in february and ssh in november as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses have decreased from to 
the company has been able to leverage its many research and development resources into multiple projects that have resulted in increased and continuously improving product offerings of both hardware and software 
sales and marketing expenses increased due to two factors 
the first factor is additional headcount added throughout the year  due primarily to the rainbow and datakey acquisitions 
the second factor is increased sales  which incrementally increases selling costs  including commissions 
as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses decreased from for to for the decrease in the percentage of total revenue was expected as the company continues to leverage its current product offerings and sales force to handle the additional demand and markets that the company is moving into throughout the world 
general and administrative expenses increased due to additional legal and professional fees  as well as increased headcount 
there were costs incurred in associated with compliance with the provisions of sarbanes oxley 
we expect to continue to incur compliance related costs  however management does not expect these costs to have a material impact on results of operations 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were for and for in  the company s acquisitions of cylink and the raqia assets necessitated the write off of in process research and development costs totaling million in the aggregate cylink million  raqia million 
there were no such charges in associated with the rainbow or datakey acquisitions 
costs of integration of acquired companies increased million from the year ended december  to the same period in the costs for the period reflect significant integration and professional fees related to the cylink acquisition 
the costs in reflect rainbow and datakey integration costs 
for the significant costs of integration were approximately million of personnel and related costs  related to the re branding of the combined company  and million of legal and professional fees 
these costs will decrease significantly throughout as we complete these integrations of people  systems  products and cultures into the combined company in the decrease is contingent upon any other acquisitions that the company would execute in the restructuring charges for of million for represents an estimated liability to vacate one of our leased facilities 
we have been able to consolidate leased facilities as we continue to integrate the businesses we acquired in and this restructuring charge may change during the remaining term of the lease as we update our estimates of likely sublease income 
amortization of intangible assets increased from million for to million for the same period in the amortization for the period includes amortization from multiple acquisitions including cylink  raqia  ssh and nine and a half months of amortization related to the rainbow acquisition as well as two and a half months of datakey 
for the same period in  amortization of intangible assets includes eleven months of amortization related to the cylink acquisition  ten months of amortization related to the raqia acquisition and two months related to the ssh acquisition 
there was no rainbow cost in this will continue to be a significant cost to the company for and future periods 
amortization of unearned compensation is a cost specific to the rainbow acquisition 
it reflects the amortization of the intrinsic value of the unvested portion of common stock options assumed by us in the rainbow acquisition 
we did not assume any unvested options during interest and other income  net variance dollars in thousands interest and other income  net the increase in interest and other income is due primarily to increased cash and investment balances that increased interest earned over the prior period 
income tax expense variance dollars in thousands income tax expense the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  is 
the overall effective rate was more than the us statutory rate primarily due to the impact of certain acquisition related costs that are not deductible for tax purposes  offset by the tax benefits associated with foreign subsidiaries operating in lower tax rate jurisdictions 
in  the effective income tax rate was 
the difference between this rate and the us statutory rate was primarily due to the non deductible write off of in process research and development costs and net operating losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which no tax benefit was recognized 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues and gross margins variance dollars in thousands revenues by type license and royalties products service and maintenance total revenues by segment embedded security division enterprise security division total revenue mix by type license and royalties products service and maintenance total revenue mix by segment embedded security division enterprise security division total gross margins by type license and royalties products service and maintenance total gross margins by segment embedded security division enterprise security division total includes amortization of acquired intangible assets 
the increase in licenses and royalties from to was primarily related to three items 
the largest item was the execution of six new license arrangements that accounted for million in revenue 
there were also million of new intellectual property licenses during finally  our development revenue related to our long term government contracts increased approximately million from to product revenues increased from to due to the acquisition of cylink and its wide area network wan product line 
the product revenue for that came from cylink based products was approximately million 
additional revenue came from sales of new products introduced in totaling approximately million 
this additional revenue was offset by a decrease in legacy product sales of approximately million 
the remaining decrease in product revenue was related to the embedded security division s loss of a significant contract with cisco systems early in that led to a million reduction in revenues 
the increase in service and maintenance revenue from to is due to two acquisitions 
the first was the acquisition of cylink in february  adding approximately million of service and maintenance revenue in the second was the acquisition of the oem product line of ssh in november in the period of safenet ownership  the maintenance contracts acquired in the ssh transaction accounted for million of incremental revenue 
revenues from to for the embedded security division increased slightly as increased license and royalty revenue  including intellectual property licenses  offset the loss of product revenue from the loss of a significant contract with cisco systems early in the enterprise security division significantly increased revenues from to through the acquisition of cylink and its product lines and related maintenance contracts as well as securing two significant license arrangements totaling million 
gross margins increased slightly   from to the most significant reason for this was the increase in license and royalty revenue  in dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
in  the significant licenses and intellectual property sales were software and technology based  which offer a higher percentage of gross margins in terms of dollars than our recurring royalty revenue stream or development revenues from our long term government contracts 
these higher gross margins were also offset by decreasing product margins resulting from higher component costs for the wan products compared to our legacy products 
due to several factors competition  an unsteady economy  and pricing sensitivity of high end products such as our wan products  we chose not to pass those increased costs through to our customers 
operating expenses variance dollars in thousands operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative write off of acquired in process research and development costs amortization of intangible assets cost of integration of acquired companies total the increase in research and development expenses from to was due to several factors 
headcount increased as a result of the cylink acquisition and the raqia acquisition  both in february  as well as the ssh acquisition in late several new products and technology offerings were introduced  including two new chip designs within the embedded security division and the highassurance product line with safenet s security management center from the enterprise security division 
we also continued development related to our long term government contracts 
also  we expended significant efforts in  on entering and subsequently expanding our technology and product offerings into the wireless communication market 
sales and marketing expenses increased from to  primarily as a function of revenues 
sales and marketing expenses remained constant as a percentage of sales  in and the dollar increases from to was a function of increased headcount in the sales and product marketing departments as we continued to introduce new products and expand our presence and awareness within the government  financial institution and oem sectors 
we also invested significant sales and marketing resources into our new and expanding presence in the wireless communications markets 
safenet will continue to market itself into emerging markets  like wireless communications  as the need for secured communications continues to expand 
safenet also intends to expand its market presence in emea europe  middle east  and asia as well as apac asia pacific and the americas 
general and administrative expenses increased from to as the result of increased headcount 
our management and support infrastructure increased by new employees in from in to in 
there were additional expenses specific to related to the adoption of the corporate governance requirements instituted for public companies by the sarbannes oxley act 
the write off of acquired in process research and development costs for was directly attributable to the acquisition of the raqia assets million and the acquisition of cylink million 
these write offs represent the estimated fair value of the in process research and development projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility at the acquisition dates  and had no alternate future use 
the values assigned to these acquired in process technologies relate entirely to three distinct projects a specific content inspection chip and compiler raqia  a specific gateway design for security applications that included specific government certifications cylink  and a fully integrated policy and security manager for multiple platforms and networks that use safenet technology cylink 
the estimated fair values of these projects were determined by the use of discounted cash flow models  using discount rates that took into account the stage of completion  and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization of the technology and product 
subsequent to the acquisitions  we incurred approximately million in additional research and development charges to complete the development of these technologies 
completion of the development of these technologies occurred during the first quarter of  reaching both technological feasibility and general availability 
for  the write off of in process research and development costs amounted to million  all of which related to the acquisition of securealink  which was for the in process research and development of a new application specific integrated circuit that was completed and licensed to a customer in we incurred an additional million of costs to complete this project during the amortization of acquired intangible assets for related to the acquisitions of cylink and the raqia assets  as well as securealink 
we acquired intangible assets  including developed technology  patents  customer relationships contracts  backlog  and non compete agreements 
the amortization of developed technology and backlog is included in costs of revenues and the remainder is included in amortization of intangible assets 
the cylink intangible assets total million and are being amortized over a weighted average useful life of years 
the raqia intangible assets total million and are being amortized over three years 
the securealink intangible assets total million and are being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from one to five years 
for  the amortization of intangible assets related only to the acquisition of securealink and the appropriate intangible assets 
costs of integration of acquired companies are costs specifically incurred as a result of integrating the people  products  and technology of cylink  the raqia and ssh assets  as well as some preliminary costs for the merger with rainbow technologies 
the integrations of cylink and raqia were substantially completed during the second quarter of the integration of ssh assets and people was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of these costs are primarily employee transition costs and professional fees 
interest and other income  net variance dollars in thousands interest and other income  net the increase from to is attributable to higher cash balances in generating increased interest income of million 
in  we received  through our dutch subsidiary  a grant from the dutch government for developing technology in the netherlands of million 
there was no such grant in income tax expense benefit variance dollars in thousands income tax expense benefit the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately 
this overall rate reflects the recognition of a tax benefit related to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities established in purchase accounting for non deductible intangible assets  offset by the usage of us net operating loss carryforwards nols and current year deductions related to the exercise of non qualified stock options and the disqualified disposition of incentive stock options for which the tax benefit is recorded as a direct increase to stockholders equity rather than as a reduction of income tax expense 
during  we incurred operating losses for which we recorded a full valuation allowance  as we could not predict the ultimate realization of the related deferred tax asset 
we believe the issuance of shares in the public offering we completed on july   when combined with the issuance of shares in connection with acquisitions in and  may have resulted in a change in control for purposes of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  which would limit our ability to utilize a portion of these nols 
while we do not believe this limitation on the use of these nols would have a significant impact on our business  we are not able to quantify the amount of the limitation at this time 
loss from discontinued operations gds variance dollars in thousands loss from discontinued operations the loss for resulted from our decision to discontinue operations at gds  which was formerly our european operations segment  in the first quarter of the discontinuation of operations was completed in may there are no costs associated with this activity in liquidity and capital resources as of december   safenet had working capital of million including unrestricted cash  restricted cash  and short term investments of million 
the operating activities has provided cash to the business for each of the years ending december    and  respectively 
safenet believes that its current cash resources and future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its anticipated short term and long term needs 
for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately million 
the decrease is attributable to an increase in accounts receivable  resulting from customer purchases late in the year  with offsetting increases in net income and other operating activities 
cash provided by investing activities increased million  primarily due to cash received from the rainbow acquisition of million and a reduction of approximately million in the purchase of securities 
cash provided by financing activities decreased by million  which is mainly attributed to our july secondary stock offering which yielded net cash proceeds of million 
there was no such cash inflow in we have expended  and will continue to expend  significant amounts of cash for acquisition and integration costs related to prior and future acquisitions 
for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million of integration costs related to the rainbow and datakey acquisitions 
we expect to incur additional costs associated with the acquisition 
these costs relate to professional fees such as legal  due diligence  professional integration advisory services and financial advisory fees and other non recurring costs of integrating acquired companies 
additionally  we would expect that there may be additional cash obligations resulting from future acquisitions that we may pursue 
the following table sets forth  as of december   our commitments and contractual obligations for the years indicated amounts in thousands less than more than total one year years years years operating leases subleases total the operating leases are for the multiple facilities that we lease for our operations  sales and headquarters inflation and seasonality we do not believe that inflation will significantly impact our business 
we do not believe our business is seasonal 
however  because we generally recognize product revenues upon shipment and software revenues upon establishing fair value of undelivered elements  recognition may be irregular and uneven  thereby disparately impacting quarterly operating results and balance sheet comparisons 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in this note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our senior management has discussed each of these critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we calculate the allowance based on a specific analysis of past due balances and also consider historical trends of write offs 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory we provide for our estimated inventory obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we utilize projected sales by product to determine the net realizable value of the inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
software development costs we calculate amortization of our capitalized software development costs based on the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product including the period being reported on 
in addition  we assess the recoverability of software development costs by comparing the unamortized balance to the net realizable value of the asset and write off the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the net realizable value 
these calculations require management to make assumptions about future demand for our products  future revenues to be generated from the sale of our products  as well as the estimated useful lives of developed technology 
if actual market conditions or product demand is different from those assumptions  or if changes in technology limit the useful life of our core technology  additional amortization or write downs may be required 
product warranties we estimate the costs that may be incurred under its warranties and records a liability at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect the company s warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the estimated cost per claim 
we periodically assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
while warranty costs have historically been within expectations  it is possible that warranty rates will change in the future based on new product introductions and other factors 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting 
a portion of the purchase price for each of these businesses is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on estimated fair values at the dates of acquisitions 
any excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill 
the identified intangible assets include patents  developed technology  purchase orders  contract backlog and acquired in process research and development assets 
research and development assets are written off at the date of acquisition in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
the fair values were determined by management  generally based upon information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and valuations prepared by independent valuation experts 
the valuations have been based primarily upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value using risk adjusted discount rates 
for certain classes of intangible assets  the valuations have been based upon estimated cost of replacement 
the assigned useful lives  which range from one to ten years  are based upon periods of estimated cash flows and other factors 
if we used different assumptions and estimates in the calculation of the fair value of identified intangible assets and the estimation of the related useful lives  the amounts allocated to these assets  as well as the related amortization expense  would have been significantly different than the amounts recorded 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under statement  goodwill is no longer amortized but is reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value using the impairment testing methodology in statement indicators of potential impairment include operating losses  loss of a significant customer and adverse industry developments 
impairment testing for goodwill is conducted annually 
our most recent test was conducted as of october  the impairment test was based upon a comparison of the estimated fair values of our reporting units  the embedded security division and the enterprise security division  to the sums of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities allocated to each reporting unit 
the fair values used in this evaluation were estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections for the reporting units 
in order to project future cash flows  management made a number of assumptions concerning such things as future sales volume levels  future price levels  and rates of increase in operating expenses 
since the estimated fair values of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value of their recorded net assets  no impairment was identified or recorded 
however  if we used different assumptions and estimates in the calculation of the fair value of the reporting units  including different discount and growth rates  an impairment of goodwill may have been identified 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from software and technology licenses  product sales  maintenance and other services 
software and technology licenses contain multiple elements  including the product license  maintenance and or other services 
the recognition of revenue under these arrangements requires management to make judgments about the likelihood of granting future concessions and the ultimate collectibility of fees 
revenues that are earned under long term contracts to develop high assurance encryption and other technology are recognized using contract accounting 
under contract accounting  revenue from these arrangements is typically recognized using the percentage of completion method 
progress to completion is measured using either contract milestones  costs incurred  or units of delivery 
accounting for these contracts requires the estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each contract 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then future margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of financial instruments 
we are exposed to financial market risks  primarily related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we currently do not have any derivative financial instruments to protect against adverse currency movements 
we manage our exposure to market risks related to operations through regular operating and financing activities 
all of the potential impacts noted below are based on a sensitivity analysis performed as of december  actual results may differ materially 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
such fluctuations impact the recorded values of our investments in foreign subsidiaries in our consolidated balance sheet  and our foreign currency translation adjustment  a component of other comprehensive income 
for the year ended december   a change in average exchange rates would have changed our reported currency translation adjustment of million by approximately million 
for the year ended december   a change in the average exchange rates would have changed the company s foreign currency transaction earnings by approximately million 
we currently do not have any derivative financial instruments to protect against adverse currency movements 
we manage our exposure to market risks related to operations through regular operating and financing activities 
all of the potential impacts noted above are based on a sensitivity analysis performed as of december  actual results may differ materially 
interest rate risk we are exposed to investment risk to the extent we purchase short term interest bearing investment securities  which are considered cash equivalents and short term investments 
for the year ended december   we had net interest income of approximately million 
a change in the average interest rate for the year ended december  would have had a negligible effect on earnings 
at december  and  we did not have any interest bearing obligations 
in addition  we do not hold any derivative instruments and do not have any commodity market risk
