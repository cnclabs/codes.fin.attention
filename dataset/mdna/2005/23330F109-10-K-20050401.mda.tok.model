item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that are in item of this document 
business general we directly or through contractors  design  manufacture  sell  and service information technology and audio surveillance technology products through two major business segments 
these two business segments are the transportation communications segment and the law enforcement and surveillance segment 
while service is a significant aspect of dri s marketing strategy  it is not yet a significant generator of revenue and was less than percent of net sales for the years ended december    and dri s transportation communications segment products are sold worldwide within the passenger information communication industry and market 
we sell to transportation vehicle equipment customers generally in two broad categories  end customers and original equipment manufacturers of transportation 
table of contents vehicles 
end customers include municipalities  regional transportation districts  federal  state  and local departments of transportation  transit agencies  public  private  or commercial operators of vehicles  and rental car agencies 
the relative percentage of sales to end customers as compared to oem customers varies widely and frequently from quarter to quarter and year to year and within products and product lines comprising dri s mix of total sales in any given period 
dri s law enforcement and surveillance segment serves customers in the us federal  state  and local law enforcement agencies or organizations  as well as their counterparts abroad 
we produce a line of digital audio filter systems and tape transcribers used to improve the quality and intelligibility of both live and recorded voices 
we market dri s law enforcement and surveillance products domestically and internationally to law enforcement entities and other customers in or supporting government organizations 
sales to dri s customers are characterized by a lengthy sales cycle that generally extends for a period of two to months 
in addition  purchases by a majority of dri s customers are dependent upon federal  state and local funding that may vary from year to year and quarter to quarter 
we recognize product sales upon shipment of products to customers and service revenue upon completion of the service 
because dri s operations are characterized by significant research and development expenses preceding product introduction  net sales and certain related expenses may not be recorded in the same period  thereby producing fluctuations in operating results 
dri s dependence upon large contracts and orders  as well as upon a small number of relatively large customers or projects  increases the magnitude of fluctuations in operating results particularly on a period to period  or period over period  comparison basis 
for a more complete description of dri s business  including a description of dri s products  sales cycle and research and development  see item business 
results of operations the following discussion provides an analysis of dri s results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
this should be read in conjunction with dri s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
the operating results of the years presented were not significantly affected by inflation 
the following table sets forth the percentage of dri s sales represented by certain items included in dri s statements of operations year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development total operating expenses operating income loss other expense  foreign currency gain and interest income loss before income tax benefit expense income tax benefit expense income loss before minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiary minority interest in consolidated subsidiary net income loss 
table of contents comparison of results for the years ended december  and net sales and gross profit 
net sales for increased million  or percent  from million for to million for dri s gross profit for increased million  or percent  from million for to million for following is a discussion of the key factors affecting these changes in net sales and gross profit by segment 
in  the company recorded revenues associated with a software license agreement of million  as compared to thousand in without the software license revenues and related gross profit  net sales would have increased from and our gross profit would have increased from for  sales for our transportation communications segment increased million  or percent  from million for to million for the increase resulted from an increase in us domestic sales of million plus an increase in international sales of million 
in the us  the increase is primarily attributable to higher integrated systems sales  partially offset by lower sales in electronic sign systems 
the increase in international sales is attributed to higher sales in the nordic and brazilian markets and more favorable average foreign currency exchange rates in compared to the increase in net sales due to foreign currency fluctuations in was approximately million 
dri has no control over the foreign currency fluctuations and does not use currency hedging tools 
the respective foreign companies primarily transact business in their functional currency thereby reducing the impact of foreign currency translation differences 
if the us dollar strengthens compared to the foreign currencies converted  it is possible the total sales reported in us dollars could decline 
product prices on sales of products have declined in as compared to  primarily due to competition 
expected sales growth in the transportation communications segment will be dependent upon the expansion of new product offerings and technology  as well as expansion into new geographic areas 
we believe our relatively high market share positions in most markets preclude significant sales growth from increased market share 
gross profit for the transportation communications segment increased thousand  or percent  from million in to million in however  in  the company recorded a million inventory obsolescence charge  as compared to a thousand inventory obsolescence charge in had the increase in inventory obsolescence not occurred  gross profit for the transportation communications segment would have increased percent from as a percentage of segment sales  gross profit was percent of net segment sales in as compared to percent in of the net increase in gross profit  thousand was attributed to us operations and thousand was attributed to the international operations 
domestic gross margins improved primarily due to product cost savings in despite continued pricing pressures 
as a percent of sales  us operations increased average gross margins from percent in to percent in  which was primarily attributed to decreases in the cost of key components in the electronic destination sign systems 
the consolidated international operations realized average gross margins of percent in and percent in the decrease in gross margins is attributed to product mix and the introduction in of the lower priced all led electronic destination sign systems in the european markets 
though we may experience continued pricing pressure  we expect our gross margins within our individual product lines to be relatively stable in the near term as we continue to recognize cost savings resulting from recent and future cost reduction efforts 
however  period to period  overall gross margins will still reflect the variations in sales mix and geographical dispersion of product sales 
part of the cost reductions in will result from the full effect of cost initiatives including in house production of sub assemblies such as cabling and wiring harnesses 
producing such items in house saves costs  allows better delivery times for our customers  and allows us to produce in quantities that are more efficient 
we also expect improvements in gross margins through more frequent sales of a combination of products and services offering a broader project solution  and through the introduction of technology improvements 
for  sales for the law enforcement and surveillance segment increased thousand or percent  from million for to million for the increase is attributed to the reallocation of federal and state funds to support post security issues 

table of contents gross profit for the law enforcement and surveillance segment for increased thousand  or percent  from thousand for to million for however  the company recorded a thousand inventory obsolescence charge in compared to no such charge in had the inventory obsolescence not occurred  gross profit for the law enforcement and surveillance segment would have increased thousand or percent from as a percentage of segment sales  gross profit was percent of net segment sales in as compared to percent during lower sales in versus to the us federal government and from a special research project for a foreign government  which yield higher gross margins  contributed to the decline in gross margins 
management believes improvement in gross profit percentage is dependent upon overall economic and competitive conditions in the law enforcement and surveillance sector  introduction of new technology products  and the continued success of on going cost reduction programs 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses for increased million  or percent  from million for to million for the majority of this increase was comprised of the increased compensation and benefits of thousand  or percent over  an increase in legal expense of thousand stemming from defense costs relative to a patent infringement case settled in june  and the costs incurred in connection with series e  series f  and common stock financings 
the company also experienced an increase in audit and tax services professional fees of thousand stemming from the financings and a change in independent accountants  an increase in public company costs including board of directors costs resulting from a greater number of committee meetings and financial communications printing costs of thousand  and an increase in outside consulting costs including it services of thousand 
all other general operating and administrative expenses increased by thousand 
the increase also includes foreign currency fluctuations  but the overall increase is attributed to additional personnel added during the year to support the additional requirements of reporting and management  an increase in average health care benefits and taxes  higher legal expenses in patent litigation  higher audit and tax services due to changes in regulations  particularly the sarbanes oxley act of  higher depreciation from increases in capital asset purchase  capitalization of internal developed systems and software  and general inflation in the prices of goods and services 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses were percent in and percent for management believes  that as sales increase  these expenses will decrease as a percentage of sales 
however  in terms of absolute dollars  selling  general  and administrative expenses are planned to increase in future periods due to expansion into other geographic areas  expansion through acquisition  and introduction of new products and services 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for decreased thousand  or percent  from million for to million for this category of expenses includes internal engineering personnel  outside engineering expense for software and hardware development  sustaining product engineering  and new product development 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased from percent in to percent in during  certain engineering personnel were used in the development of software that met the capitalization criteria of sfas no 
 capitalization of software development costs  which resulted in recording approximately million of costs as an asset that will be amortized as the sales of the software are realized over a period no longer than three years 
had this amount not been capitalized  research and development expenses for would have been 
table of contents million as compared to million for in the longer term  we expect these expenses expressed as a percentage of sales to range from approximately to percent 
operating loss 
operating loss increased million from thousand in to million in the increase is primarily due to higher operating expenses and personnel costs  and the inventory obsolescence adjustment 
these factors were partially offset by the increased sales in both operating segments  all as described above other income expense 
total other income in was thousand  a net increase in expense of thousand as compared to thousand for this decrease was primarily due to an increase in other income totaling thousand  a decrease in other expense of thousand  and a decrease interest income of thousand 
foreign currency gain 
total foreign currency gain in was thousand  a net decrease of thousand as compared to thousand for interest expense 
the net decrease in interest expense of thousand from million for to thousand for was due to a decrease in long term debt 
in april  approximately million of convertible debentures with an annual interest rate of percent were converted into common stock 
additionally  in april and october  the company completed two separate private placements of common shares totaling million each and used the proceeds primarily to reduce debt and the working capital line of credit 
income tax expense 
net income tax expense  consisting primarily of net deferred tax expense  was thousand in as compared with an income tax expense of thousand in in  the most significant component of income tax expense was an thousand increase in the tax valuation allowance expense arising primarily from united states federal and state jurisdictions 
the company determined in that a significant portion of the deferred income tax assets previously recorded through  would more likely than not  not be realizable 
net loss applicable to common shareholders 
the net loss applicable to common shareholders increased million from a net loss of million in to a net loss of million in the increased loss is primarily the result of the changes in net operating loss previously discussed  the income tax expense resulting from the valuation allowance  offset by the lack of a charge in comparable to the non cash beneficial conversion charge of thousand on the issuance of series f convertible preferred stock in comparison of results for the years ended december  and net sales and gross profit 
net sales for the year ended december  decreased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  dri s gross profit for the year ended december  increased thousand  or percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  following is a discussion of these changes in net sales and gross profit by segment 
for the year ended december   sales for our transportation communications segment decreased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease resulted from a decrease in us domestic sales of million partially offset by an increase in international sales of million 
the decrease in us domestic sales in was attributed to late year contract shifts to and lost business due to order timing difficulties 
the net sales for the three months ended december  was million as compared to million for the three months ended december  the decrease of million or percent was primarily the result of the order shifts and ultimate cancellation of certain transit authority orders due to contract differences 
see note  quarterly financial data 
the canceled orders are extraordinary and the underlying issues leading to such cancellation are not likely to materialize in all of these orders may or may not be realized in and  to the extent realized  may not be incremental to the year as planned 
the increase in international sales is attributed to higher sales in the nordic and brazilian markets and more favorable average foreign 
table of contents currency exchange rates in compared to dri has no control over the foreign currency fluctuations and does not require the use of currency hedging tools as the respective foreign companies primarily transact business in its functional currency thereby reducing the impact of foreign currency translation differences 
if the us dollar strengthens compared to the foreign currencies converted  it is possible the total sales reported in us dollars could decline 
product prices on sales of products  which comprise a majority of sales  have declined in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to competition 
expected sales growth in the transportation communications segment will be dependent upon the expansion of new product offerings and technology  as well as expansion into new geographic areas 
we believe our relatively high market share positions in most markets preclude significant sales growth from increased market share 
gross profit for the transportation communications segment for the year ended december  increased thousand  or percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of segment sales  gross profit was percent of net segment sales in as compared to percent during the net increase of thousand was attributed to the international operations  which realized a net margin increase of thousand offset by a small margin decrease of thousand in the us domestic gross margins 
substantially due to a lower sales volume resulting from the above noted order shifts and delays  us domestic gross margins remained relatively flat for as a percent of sales  us operations increased average gross margins from percent in to percent in  which was primarily attributed to decreases in the cost of key components in the electronic destination sign systems 
the consolidated international operations realized average gross margins in of percent and percent in the slight decrease in gross margins is attributed to product mix and introduction in of the lower priced all led electronic destination sign systems in the european markets 
the gross margins are affected by selling prices  which are expected to be relatively stable in the near term and direct cost of materials and services to manufacture and assemble products 
we expect to realize gross margin improvements in reflecting the full effect of initiatives and through negotiating with suppliers lowered unit component costs  introduced technology improvements decreasing the overall system cost and began in house production of sub assemblies such as cabling and wiring hardness assemblies that are less expensive than third party manufactured harness assemblies 
we believe improvement in gross profit percentage is dependent primarily upon overall economic and competitive conditions in the transportation sector  introduction of new technology products  and the continued success of on going cost reduction programs 
for the year ended december   sales for the law enforcement and surveillance segment decreased thousand or percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease is attributed to the reallocation of federal and state funds to support post security issues as well as a delay in approval of the us federal budget 
gross profit for the law enforcement and surveillance segment for the year ended december  decreased thousand  or percent  from million for the year ended december  to thousand for the year ended december  as a percentage of segment sales  gross profit was percent of net segment sales in as compared to percent during lower sales to the us federal government primarily contributed to the decline in gross margins 
management believes improvement in gross profit percentage is dependent upon overall economic and competitive conditions in the law enforcement and surveillance sector  introduction of new technology products  and the continued success of on going cost reduction programs 
selling  general  and administrative  research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the majority of this increase was attributed to a net increase in compensation and benefits of thousand  an increase in depreciation of thousand  an increase in legal expense of thousand  an increase in audit and tax services of thousand  an increase in travel related expense of thousand along with an thousand increase in all other general operating and administrative expenses 
the increase also includes foreign currency fluctuations  but the overall increase is attributed to additional personnel added during the 
table of contents year to support the additional requirements of reporting and management  an increase in average health care benefits and taxes  higher legal expenses in patent litigation  higher audit and tax services due to changes in regulations such as the sarbanes oxley act  higher depreciation from increases in capital asset purchase and capitalization of internal developed systems and software and general economic increases in goods and services 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses were percent for the year ended december  and percent for the year ended december  management believes these expenses will decrease as a percentage of sales in future periods if sales increases substantially and we continue to focus on expense and cost reduction and controls 
however  selling  general and administrative expenses are planned to increase in future periods due to expansion into other geographic areas  expansion through acquisition  and introduction of new products and services 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased thousand  or percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this category of expenses includes internal engineering personnel and outside engineering expense for software and hardware development  sustaining product engineering and new product development 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased from percent in to percent in during  certain engineering personnel were used in the development of software that met the capitalization criteria of sfas no 
 capitalization of software development costs  which resulted in recording of million of costs as an asset that will be amortized as the sales of the software are realized over a period no longer than three years 
had this amount not been capitalized  research and development expenses for the year ended december  would have been million as compared to million for the year ended december  in the longer term  we expect these expenses to remain in the same general range as a percentage of sales  as in the past three years approximately percent to percent 
operating income 
the net change in operating income for the year ended december  was a decrease of million from operating income of thousand for the year ended december  to a net operating loss of thousand for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to decreased sales in both operating segments and higher operating expenses and personnel costs as described above 
the more significant increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were in the us parent entities expense categories of legal  audit  tax  accounting and bank fees 
other income expense 
other income expense for the year ended december  was thousand  a net increase of thousand as compared to thousand for this increase was primarily due to a decrease in other expense totaling thousand  offset by decreases in other income of thousand 
foreign currency gain 
total foreign currency gain in was thousand  a net decrease of thousand as compared to thousand for interest expense 
interest expense decreased thousand from million for to million for the decrease in interest expense was due to a decrease in the weighted average outstanding balance of long term debt as well as lower interest rates 
income tax expense 
net income tax expense  consisting primarily of net deferred tax expense  was thousand for the year ended december   as compared with an income tax expense of thousand for the year ended december  in  current tax expense of thousand  arising from foreign jurisdictions  was partially offset by deferred tax benefits of thousand arising primarily from united states federal and state jurisdictions 
net loss applicable to common shareholders 
the net change in net loss applicable to common shareholders for the year ended december  was an increase of million from a net loss of thousand for the year ended december  to a net loss of million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily the result of the net operating loss before minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiary of million for the year ended december  and recording a non 
table of contents cash beneficial conversion charge of thousand on issuance of series f convertible preferred stock 
see note preferred stock 
profit improvement in we estimate that approximately thousand of profit improvement was realized from various initiatives 
this is partially evidenced by the gross margin improvement during the year 
liquidity and capital resources the company s net working capital as of december  was million compared to million as of december  our principal sources of liquidity from current assets included cash and cash equivalents of thousand  trade and other receivables of million and inventories of million 
the us asset based lending agreement provides for borrowings up to percent of eligible trade accounts receivable and up to percent of eligible inventory 
the lending relationship with our foreign bank allows percent advance rates on trade accounts receivable and percent on inventory 
the present asset based lending agreements are sufficient for day to day cash requirements although the company would like to level out the sometimes erratic monthly sales volume thereby permitting liquidity projections to be more easily maintained and controlled 
the company continues to decrease the average days sales outstanding in accounts receivable and expects to increase inventory turns through better materials requirement planning  reworking what otherwise might be considered slow moving inventory and negotiating lower component prices through volume purchase programs 
the most significant current liabilities at december  included short term bank and asset based borrowings of million  accounts payable of million  accrued expenses of million  and current maturities of long term debt  and dividends payable of million  and thousand  respectively 
the short term bank borrowings are primarily asset based lending agreements and directly related to the sales and customer account collections 
the senior asset based revolving debt with lasalle business credit corp lasalle is classified as a current liability rather than a long term liability 
the loan agreement with lasalle was negotiated with the intent that the revolving debt would be classified and managed as long term debt  however  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement  requires the company to classify all of our outstanding debt under the bank facility as a current liability 
the loan agreement has a subjective acceleration clause which could enable the bank to call the loan  but such language is customary in asset based lending agreements and management does not expect the bank to use this particular clause to inhibit the company from making borrowings as provided under the agreement 
it is our intention to manage the bank credit facility as long term debt with a final maturity date in  as provided for in the agreement that we signed 
our operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december  sources of cash from operations totaled thousand and resulted from a decrease in other receivables of thousand  a decrease in prepaids and other current assets of thousand  a decrease in other assets of thousand  an increase in accrued expenses of thousand and our net loss of million offset by non cash expenses of million 
non cash expenses included thousand related to our valuation allowance for deferred taxes and million related to the write down of obsolete inventory to its net realizable value 
all other non cash expenses were of normal  routine amounts associated with operations 
cash used in operating activities totaled million and primarily resulted from increases in trade accounts receivable of million and inventories of thousand  and a decrease in trade accounts payable of million 
the increase in trade accounts receivable results from a percent increase in sales during the fourth quarter of compared to the same quarter in the increase in inventories stemmed primarily from our foreign operations and resulted from a build up of inventory components at year end for delivery of finished sign systems in the first quarter of the decrease in trade accounts payable is a direct result of cash received from financing activities utilized to pay down outstanding balances substantially past trade terms 
we consider the changes incurred in our operating assets and liabilities routine  other than the reduction of trade accounts payable resulting from financing activities  given the number and size of orders relative to our industry and our size 
we expect working capital requirements to continue to increase with growth in sales  primarily due to the timing between when we must pay suppliers and the time we receive payment from our customers 

table of contents our investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december  the primary uses of cash were for purchases of computer  test  and office equipment  and costs incurred for internally developed software 
cash flows from investing activities resulted from a small number of routine sales of individual pieces of equipment no longer used or that had been replaced 
we do not anticipate any significant expenditures for  or sales of  capital equipment in the near future 
our financing activities generated net cash of million 
sources of cash resulted from issuance of common and preferred stock net of issuance costs of million 
net proceeds from issuance of common stock resulted from two pipe s private investment in public entities and proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants 
net proceeds from issuance of preferred stock of thousand resulted from the sale of our series e preferred stock 
proceeds from these equity sales were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
more specifically  the net proceeds were used to pay down existing lines of credit and trade accounts payable 
uses of cash in financing activities were for the payment of dividends on our series aaa and series e preferred stock of thousand and the net of borrowings and payments on our revolving lines of credit of million 
at february   we had cash and cash equivalents of thousand and a working capital surplus of million 
financing activities in on april   the company sold  shares of common stock to institutional investors for per share 
the company also granted the investors warrants to acquire  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  exercisable for a period of five years 
the company used the net proceeds of the private placement for general working capital purposes 
on april   bfsus special opportunities trust plc and renaissance us growth investment trust plc converted debentures with a principal amount of million and an interest rate of percent annually into  shares of common stock 
this conversion results in a reduction of thousand interest expense annually 
mr 
cleveland  renaissance capital group s president and chief executive officer  serves on dri s board of directors 
concurrent with the debenture conversion  all of the company s outstanding shares of series f convertible preferred stock  which were held by dolphin offshore partners  lp  were converted into  shares of the company s common stock 
the series f convertible preferred stock had an aggregate liquidation value of million and required the payment of dividends  payable in additional shares of series f convertible preferred stock  at the rate of percent per annum 
on october   we sold  shares of our common stock to an institutional investor for per share 
we received aggregate consideration for the sale in the amount of million 
we also granted the investor a warrant to acquire  shares of common stock at an exercise price of  exercisable for a period ending five years after the date of issuance 
additionally  we granted a placement agent a warrant to acquire  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of  exercisable for a period ending five years after the date of issuance 
the warrants granted to the investor and the placement agent first become exercisable on april  in connection with the above transaction  we granted registration rights for the common shares purchased in the private placement and issuable upon exercise of the warrants 
a registration statement registering the common stock and warrants has been filed and is under review by the securities and exchange commission 
financing activities in on february   shareholders of the company s non publicly traded series aaa preferred stock approved two changes to its series aaa articles of incorporation at a special meeting of such shareholders 
the changes provide a reduction to the annual dividend rate for each share of series aaa preferred stock from percent to percent  and a reduction in the conversion rate for each share of series aaa preferred stock from per share to per share 

table of contents management conclusion the company believes the equity raised through series e  series f  and common stock placements in  together with its borrowing availability under its existing credit facilities and its existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund existing operations for the subsequent month period 
however  we will pursue all appropriate measures to address liquidity pressures should cash flow prove unsatisfactory in we anticipate additional equity financing may be sought in in conjunction with potential acquisitions or launch of new business initiatives 
additionally  management expects that increasing sales  continued improvement in the company s product costs resulting from ongoing cost reduction activities  ongoing efforts aimed at controlling administrative expenses  and improvements in managing the company s working capital will further contribute to its ongoing liquidity 
however  if these plans do not achieve the improvements management believes they will  other courses of action would be pursued  which may include sales of divisions of the company or other actions to curtail operations 
if divisions were to be sold in a liquidation mode  the recorded values may not be fully realized 
critical accounting policies and estimates dri s significant accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following is a listing of dri s critical accounting policies and estimates and a brief description of each allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  including deferred tax assets  and revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts relates to trade accounts receivable 
it reflects our estimate of the amount of our outstanding accounts receivable that are not likely to be collected 
most of our company s sales are to large oem equipment manufacturers or to state or local governmental units or authorities  so management expects low losses from true collectability problems resulting from insolvency or actual inability to pay 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is a periodic estimate prepared by management based upon identification of the collections of specific accounts and the overall condition of the receivable portfolios 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze our trade receivables  the customer relationships underlying the receivables  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment terms 
inventory valuation 
we periodically evaluate the carrying amount of inventory based upon current shipping forecasts and warranty and post warranty component requirements 
our company  as a part of the sale  typically extends a warranty term generally ranging from one to three years 
we account for this liability through a warranty reserve on the balance sheet 
additionally  in special situations  we may  solely at our discretion  use extended or post warranty services as a marketing tool 
in these instances  such future warranty costs have previously been included in the established warranty reserves 
many of our customers have contractual or legal requirements  which dictate an extended period of time for us to maintain replacement parts 
our evaluation involves a multi element approach incorporating inventory turnover and the stratification of inventory by risk category  among other elements 
the approach incorporates both recent historical information and management estimates of trends 
our approach is intended to take into consideration potential excess and obsolescence in relation to our installed base  engineering changes  uses for components in other products  return rights with vendors and end of life manufacture 
if any of the elements of our estimate were to deteriorate  additional write downs may be required 
the inventory write down calculations are reviewed periodically and additional write downs are recorded as deemed necessary 

table of contents intangible assets and goodwill 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and  as a result  we ceased to amortize goodwill at january  in lieu of amortization  sfas no 
requires that we perform an impairment review of goodwill at least annually  or when management becomes aware of any circumstance or trend that is reasonably likely to give rise to impairment 
sfas no 
requires us to test goodwill for impairment at a level referred to as a reporting unit 
goodwill is considered impaired and a loss is recognized when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
we use a number of valuation methods including quoted market prices  discounted cash flows and sales multiples to determine fair value 
income taxes 
we are required to pay income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
these jurisdictions include the us federal government and several states  and a number of foreign countries 
each of these jurisdictions has its own laws and regulations  some of which are quite complex and some of which are the subject of disagreement among experts and authorities as to interpretation and application 
the estimation process for preparation of our financial statements involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
we review internally our operations and the application of applicable laws and rules to our circumstances 
to the extent we believe necessary  we also seek the advice of professional advisers in various jurisdictions 
revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon the shipment of products to customers  based upon a purchase agreement  established pricing  and defined shipping and delivery terms 
even though the company receives customer sales orders that may require scheduled product deliveries over several months  sales are only recognized upon physical shipment of the product to the customer 
revenue from more complex or time spanning projects within which there are multiple deliverables including products  services  and software are accounted for in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition and statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  depending upon the facts and circumstances unique to each project 
under each of these statements of position  revenue is recognized over the life of the project based upon meeting specific delivery or performance criteria  or upon the percentage of project completion achieved in each accounting period  respectively 
service revenues are recognized upon completing the service 
service revenues include product repair not under a warranty agreement  city route mapping  product installation  training  and consulting to transit authorities and funded research and development projects 
service revenues were not a significant source of revenue for   and  but may increase in future periods due to higher post warranty repairs  retrofit installation and other service related revenues not offered in previous years 
management s plans for the years ended december    and  the company incurred net pre tax losses of million  million  and thousand  and operating activities provided used net cash of million  million  and million  respectively 
sales for increased by approximately percent compared to the however  significant non cash charges  including an thousand tax valuation allowance and million additional inventory reserve  contributed substantially to the results reflecting a combined percent of the net loss  and including a thousand tax valuation allowance reflecting percent of the net loss 
excluding these non cash charges  the net loss would have been million in compared to net losses of thousand in and thousand in the company has continued to implement plans formulated in prior years to improve the operating results and to reduce the pressure on liquidity 
though many of the objectives were achieved in prior years  efforts will continue in the primary elements of the company s strategies  objectives  plans  and actions were  and will continue to be restructured debt and equity 
the company has historically raised significant amounts of cash through secured and subordinated debt financing 

table of contents on november   the company replaced its asset based lending agreement formerly with guaranty business credit corporation with a three year agreement the credit agreement with lasalle business credit llc 
the credit agreement provides up to million in borrowing to be used for acquisitions  working capital  and general corporate purposes 
the borrowing is inclusive of million for letters of credit and million for term loans 
the interest rate on loans under this agreement is the published prime lending rate percent at december  plus percent 
there is a fee equal to 
percent of the aggregate undrawn face amount  less letters of credit outstanding 
based upon fourth quarter and full year results in  dri did not meet its financial covenants under the company s working capital line of credit with lasalle and another subordinated debt  however  such covenants were waived at december  additionally  the company did not meet its financial covenants under the working line of credit with lasalle  and the subordinated debt for the first quarter of  however  such covenants were also waived at march  the company believes that the new covenants are achievable for subsequent quarters in on april   subordinated convertible debt holders holding aggregate common equivalent shares of  converted percent of such debt into shares of common stock 
as a result of this conversion  million has been recorded as additional equity on the balance sheet and the annual cash interest expense will decrease by approximately thousand 
on february   holders of the series aaa preferred stock voted to reduce the annual dividend rate for each share of series aaa preferred stock from percent to percent  and reduce the conversion rate for each share of series aaa preferred stock from per share to per share 
these changes resulted in the number of common shares issuable upon the conversion of a single share of series aaa preferred stock increasing from shares to shares 
the reduction in the annual dividend rate will save the company approximately thousand per year in dividends 
the company presently does not anticipate the need to secure additional debt financing or negotiate additional debt restructurings in order to meet the needs of current operations 
reduce operating costs and improve efficiency 
in the normal course of business  the company has aggressively sought opportunities to reduce the cost structure and increase overall efficiency and responsiveness to its customers 
in and  the company initiated tracked and monitored profit improvement initiatives designed to further leverage the economy of scale that was developing in its operations 
the company intends to continue developing its manufacturing and assembly infrastructure and organization to meet expected production requirements 
the company will continue manufacturing in house certain key components of its products such as cable harnesses and assemblies  electronic destination sign systems  digital audio filter equipment and sub system electronics 
the company believes this will enable it to produce highly reliable  quality products  protect the proprietary nature of its technology and processes  properly control its manufacturing and assembly processes and operations  and achieve significant cost reductions 
the cost reductions encompass all major elements of cost and operating expenses 
increase ownership equity 
during  the company was involved in a number of equity transactions that resulted in a stronger balance sheet 
these transactions include the issuance of preferred and common stock in private placements  the exercise of warrants and stock options  the conversion of preferred stock to common stock  and the conversion of subordinated debt to common stock 
in the aggregate  these transactions resulted in the reclassification of debt and preferred stock of approximately million into common equity and net cash proceeds of approximately million for general use of the company 
additionally  interest costs were reduced by thousand per year and preferred stock dividends by thousand per year

r the american job creation act of the act was signed into law in october and replaces an export incentive with a deduction from domestic manufacturing income 
the act provides for a special one time tax deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated no later than we have started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision  but do not anticipate that the repatriation of foreign earnings under the act would provide an overall tax benefit to us 
however  we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until the us congress or the us treasury department provides additional guidance on certain of the act s provisions 
any repatriation of earnings under the act is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact upon our results of operations for each of our fiscal years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation will not have an adverse impact upon our operating results and financial condition 
risk factors affecting our business and prospects many of the risks discussed below have affected our business in the past  and many are likely to continue to do so 
these risks may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows  or the market price of our common stock 
risks related to indebtedness  financial condition and results of operations our substantial amount of debt could adversely affect our financial position  operations  and ability to grow 
as of december   our total debt of approximately million consisted of long term debt in the amount of million  including current maturities of approximately million  and short term debt of million 
included in the long term debt is thousand under our outstanding eight percent convertible debentures to a director of the company  million of unsecured indebtedness payable to the former owner of mobitec  and million payable under a term loan to a swedish bank 
the short term debt consisted of million outstanding under our domestic and european revolving credit facilities 
our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences in the future 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  which would reduce amounts available for working capital  capital expenditures  research and development and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less debt than we do  make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing that may be necessary in connection with our business  make it more difficult for us to implement our business and growth strategies  and cause us to have to pay higher interest rates on future borrowings 
some of our debt bears interest at variable rates 
if interest rates increase  or if we incur additional debt  the potential adverse consequences  including those described above  may be intensified 
if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations  we may be forced to reduce or delay 
table of contents planned expansion and capital expenditures  sell assets  obtain additional equity financing or restructure our debt 
our existing credit facilities contain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur additional debt 
future cash requirements or restrictions on cash could adversely affect our financial position  and an event of default under our outstanding debt instruments could impair our ability to conduct business operations 
our cash balance declined in the current year and we could incur negative overall cash flow in future periods 
if cash flow significantly deteriorates in the future  our liquidity and ability to operate our business could be adversely impacted 
additionally  our ability to raise financial capital may be hindered due to our net losses and the possibility of future negative cash flow  thus reducing our operating flexibility 
the following items  among others  could require unexpected future cash payments  limit our ability to generate cash or restrict our use of cash triggering of certain payment obligations  or acceleration of payment obligations  under our revolving credit facilities or our outstanding convertible debentures  triggering of redemption obligations under our outstanding convertible debentures  costs associated with unanticipated litigation relating to our intellectual property or other matters  taxes due upon the transfer of cash held in foreign locations  and taxes assessed by local authorities where we conduct business 
during the third quarter of  we entered into a million revolving credit facility with lasalle business credit  llc 
this facility permits us to borrow an amount determined on the basis of a formula that applies specified percentages to our domestic inventory and accounts receivable balances and then deducts a reserve amount established by the lender currently thousand 
the credit facility has an initial term of three years and is secured by substantially all of our domestic assets 
the credit agreement also has affirmative  negative  and financial covenants with which we must comply 
at december   we were not in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the credit facility  but secured a waiver from the lender  lasalle business credit  for this violation and covenants were reset going forward 
we also have a revolving credit facility with a swedish bank that we use in connection with our european operations and which is secured by substantially all the assets of our mobitec ab subsidiary 
our maximum borrowing capacity under that facility is million swedish krona  equivalent to approximately million us dollars 
that facility also contains affirmative  negative  and financial covenants 
we additionally have a revolving credit facility with a german bank that we use in connection with our german operations which is secured by accounts receivable and inventory of our german subsidiary  transit media mobitec gmbh 
our maximum borrowing capacity under that facility is million euros  equivalent to approximately thousand us dollars 
as of december   our outstanding balances were million under the domestic facilities and million under the european facilities 
a convertible subordinated debenture in the amount of thousand dated august   is payable to a shareholder and member of the board of directors  and is due in full august   if not sooner redeemed or converted  with annual interest at percent paid monthly 
it also provides for monthly principal redemption installments commencing august   each of such installments to be in the dollar amount of ten dollars per thousand dollars  of the then remaining principal amount 
the loan agreement under which the convertible debenture was issued subjects the company to a ratio of earnings before interest  depreciation  and amortization ebitda to interest to be calculated quarterly on a rolling four quarter basis and a current ratio to be calculated at each quarter end 
both ratios were waived by the debt holder for calendar year while we plan to adhere to the covenants in our credit facilities to the best of our ability  in the event that it appears we are unable to avoid an event of default  it may be necessary or advisable to retire and terminate 
table of contents one or more of the facilities and pay all remaining balances borrowed 
any such payment would further limit our available cash and cash equivalents 
furthermore  we may not be able to retire the credit facilities if we do not have adequate resources available when necessary to avoid an event of default or if we do not have adequate time to retire the credit facilities 
the consequences of an event of default under one or more of our credit facilities or other debt instruments may prevent us from conducting normal business operations 
the above cash requirements or restrictions could lead to an inadequate level of cash for operations or for capital requirements  which could have a material negative impact on our financial position and significantly harm our ability to operate the business 
we have a history of net losses and cannot assure you that we will become profitable 
we have incurred losses in almost every fiscal year since we have been a public company 
our net loss applicable to common shareholders was million in  million in  and thousand in we cannot assure you that we will become profitable or  if we do  that we will be able to sustain or increase profitability in the future 
we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  and million of december  if we cannot achieve or sustain profitability  our financial condition will be materially adversely affected and it will be much more difficult  if possible at all  to obtain additional financing and to continue to grow our business 
our efforts to reduce costs may not be effective 
if we fail to reduce costs effectively  we may not achieve profitability or positive cash flow 
we believe cost containment and expense reductions are essential to achieving profitability and positive cash flow from operations in future periods 
our efforts to reduce expenses have positively affected our results in recent periods  but we must continue to contain costs and further reduce expenses in order to achieve and sustain profitability 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
if we are not able to grow our sales while reducing our costs  as a percentage of sales  we will not be able to achieve profitability and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
moreover  sales lost due to the cancellation of our ability to fill an order in one period may not be necessarily be made up by sales in any future period 
our operating results will continue to fluctuate 
our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and period over period depending upon numerous factors  including customer demand and market acceptance of our products and solutions  new product introductions  variations in product mix  delivery due date changes  and other factors 
we operate in a market characterized by long sales cycles 
from first contact to order delivery may be a period of two years or longer in certain instances 
delivery schedules  as first established with the customer in this long cycle may change with little or no advance notice as the original delivery schedule draws near 
our business is sensitive to the spending patterns and funding of our customers  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors beyond our control 
moreover  we derive sales primarily from significant orders from a limited number of customers 
for that reason  a delay in delivery of our products in connection with a single order may significantly affect the timing of our recognition of sales between periods 
moreover  sales lost due to the cancellation of  or our inability to fill  an order in one period may not necessarily be made up by sales in any future period 
risks related to internal controls our former auditor identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting 
in connection with the audit of our financial statements for the year ended december   our former auditors  mcgladrey pullen llp  identified a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting in that there were not sufficient internal control policies and procedures over financial reporting to ensure that financial statements and schedules were reliable and accurate 
further  they identified reportable conditions including the lack of organized documentation for capitalized software  a lack of formal procedures to reconcile inter company accounts and transactions  and a lack of segregation of duties in certain foreign subsidiaries  and that there were not sufficient internal control policies and procedures over financial reporting for non routine and complex transactions to ensure the reliability and accuracy of our financial statements and schedules 
insufficient internal controls over financial reporting could cause us to fail to meet our reporting 
table of contents obligations  result in material misstatements in our financial statements  and negatively affect investor confidence 
steps taken meant to resolve material weaknesses in internal controls identified in previous years audit may not provide continuing remediation 
although the remediation steps were implemented by the end of fiscal year  the material weakness may not be considered remediated until these procedures operate for a period of time  are tested  and it is concluded that such procedures are operating effectively 
we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will be sufficient to fully remediate the material weakness or that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting will not be discovered in the future 
any failure to remediate the material weakness identified by our former auditors or implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could adversely affect our operating results  cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
any of the foregoing occurrences could cause investors to lose confidence in our internal control environment 
risks related to our operations and product development a significant portion of our sales is derived from sales to a small number of customers 
if we are not able to obtain new customers or repeat business from existing customers  our business could be seriously harmed 
we sell our products to a limited and largely fixed set of customers and potential customers 
in our transportation communications segment  we sell primarily to original equipment manufacturers and to end users such as municipalities  regional transportation districts  transit agencies  federal  state and local departments of transportation  and rental car agencies 
the identity of the customers who generate the most significant portions of our sales may vary from year to year 
in  two major customers accounted for percent of our net sales  compared to one major customer accounting for percent in and two major customers accounting for percent in if any of our major customers stopped purchasing products from us  and we were not able to obtain new customers to replace the lost business  our business and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
many factors affect whether customers reduce or delay their investments in products such as those we offer  including decisions regarding technology spending levels and general economic conditions in the countries and specific markets where the customers are located 
we depend on third parties to supply components we need to produce our products 
our products and solutions are dependent upon the availability of quality components that are procured from third party suppliers 
reliance upon suppliers  as well as industry supply conditions  generally involves several risks  including the possibility of defective parts which can adversely affect the reliability and reputation of our products  a shortage of components and reduced control over delivery schedules which can adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies and increases in component costs which can adversely affect our profitability 
we have some single sourced supplier relationships  because either alternative sources are not readily or economically available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance  quality  support  delivery  and capacity or price considerations 
if these sources are unable to provide timely and reliable supply  we could experience manufacturing interruptions  delays  or inefficiencies  adversely affecting our results of operations 
even where alternative sources of supply are available  qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of sales  which could affect operating results adversely 
many of our customers rely on government funding  and that subjects us to risks associated with governmental budgeting and authorization processes 
a majority of our sales address end customers having some degree of national  federal  regional  state  or local governmental entity funding 
these governmental entity funding mechanisms are beyond our control and often are difficult to predict 
further  general budgetary authorizations and allocations for state  local  and federal agencies can change for a variety of reasons  including general economic conditions  and have a material adverse effect on us 
for example  the tea legislation under which the funding for our transportation products business segment domestic sales are derived was subject to reauthorization in however  the current tea program has been extended 
table of contents through a series of continuing resolutions pending enactment of new long term legislation  which is currently in process in congress 
although the environmental and public works committee of the us senate has approved legislation reauthorizing tea  and the house of representatives t i committee has acted similarly with its proposal  this legislation is still subject to further review and negotiation and could even fail to be enacted 
these continuing resolutions  and delay in enactment of reauthorization legislation  tend to create uncertainty in the market 
that uncertainty in turn can tend to delay  or depress  order opportunities 
we are involved through the industry trade association  the america public transportation association  the web site of which regularly posts status information on legislative matters 
while we believe the reauthorization will occur  and that resulting federal funding will be at or above the present approximately billion annually  we cannot assure you that the legislation will be reauthorized as we expect 
in addition to federal funding to the public transit side of our domestic market  some of our customers rely on state and local funding 
these tend to be affected by general economic conditions 
for example  some transit operating authorities reduced service in and  potentially extending into  in response to the slow economy and uncertainties on the reauthorization of tea  this can have a depressing effect on sales of our products 
it is not possible to precisely quantify this impact 
any unfavorable change in any of these factors and considerations could have a material adverse effect upon us 
we must continually improve our technology to remain competitive 
our industry is characterized by  and our business strategy is substantially based upon  continuing improvement in technology 
this results in frequent introduction of new products  short product life cycles  and continual change in product price performance characteristics 
we must develop new technologies in our products and solutions in order to remain competitive 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to achieve or sustain the technological leadership that is necessary for success in our industry 
in addition  our competitors may develop new technologies that give them a competitive advantage  and we may not be able to obtain the right to use those technologies at a reasonable cost  if at all  or to develop alternative solutions that enable us to compete effectively 
a failure on our part to manage effectively the transitions of our product lines to new technologies on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect upon us 
in addition  our business depends upon technology trends in our customers businesses 
to the extent that we do not anticipate or address these technological changes  our business may be adversely impacted 
we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will be accepted by customers 
even if we are able to continue to enhance our technology and offer improved products and solutions  we cannot assure you we will be able to deliver commercial quantities of new products in a timely manner or that our products will achieve market acceptance 
further  it is necessary for our products to adhere to generally accepted and frequently changing industry standards  which are subject to change in ways that are beyond our control 
if we lose the services of our key personnel  we may be unable to replace them  and our business could be negatively affected 
our success depends in large part on the continued service of our management and other key personnel who have significant knowledge  experience  and contacts in the industries that comprise our primary markets 
our ability to continue to attract  motivate  and retain employees having these qualifications is essential to our future success 
the loss of the services of key personnel could cause us to lose market share to a competitor or otherwise materially adversely affect our business or financial condition 
risks related to our international operations there are numerous risks associated with international operations  which represent a significant part of our business 
our international operations generated about percent of our sales in our sales outside the united states were primarily in europe particularly the nordic countries  south america  the middle east  and australia 
the success and profitability of international operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  such as economic and labor conditions  political instability  tax laws including us taxes upon foreign subsidiaries  and changes in the value of the us dollar versus the local currency in which products are sold 
any unfavorable change in one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect upon us 
we maintain cash deposits in foreign locations  portions of which may be subject to significant tax or tax withholding upon transfer or withdrawal 
many countries impose taxes or fees upon removal from the 
table of contents country of cash earned in that country 
moreover  complying with foreign tax laws can be complicated and we may incur unexpected tax obligations in some jurisdictions 
while we believe our tax positions in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate are proper and fully defensible  tax authorities in those jurisdictions may nevertheless assess taxes and render judgments against us if we are unable to adequately defend our position 
in such an event  we could be required to make unexpected cash payments in satisfaction of such assessments or judgments or incur additional expenses to defend our position 
this risk is mitigated  but not completely eliminated  by the existence of our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
risks related to intellectual property we may not be able to defend successfully against claims of infringement against the intellectual property rights of others  and defense could be costly 
third parties  including our competitors  individual inventors or others  may have patents or other proprietary rights that may cover technologies that are relevant to our business 
several claims of infringement have been asserted against us in the past 
even if we believe a claim asserted against us is not valid  defending against the claim may be costly 
intellectual property litigation can be complex  protracted  and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
further  plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief and the measures of damages in intellectual property litigation are complex and often subjective or uncertain 
in some cases  we may decide that it is not economically feasible to pursue a vigorous and protracted defense and decide  instead  to negotiate licenses or cross licenses authorizing us to use a third party s technology in our products 
if we are unable to defend successfully against litigation of this type  or to obtain and maintain licenses on favorable terms  we could be prevented from manufacturing or selling our products  which would cause severe disruptions to our operations 
for these reasons  intellectual property litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
enforcing our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be costly 
we currently own two design patents and have a combination of copyrights  alliances  trade secrets  nondisclosure agreements  and licensing agreements to establish and protect our ownership of  and access to  proprietary and intellectual property rights 
the loss or circumvention of any one or more of these protective aspects would not significantly impact our current business 
however  if it became necessary or desirable to enforce our rights in the future  doing so could be costly 
risks related to our equity securities and convertible debentures the public market for our common stock may be volatile  especially since market prices for technology stocks often have been unrelated to operating performance 
we cannot assure you that an active trading market will be sustained or that the market price of our common stock will not decline 
recently  the stock market in general  and the shares of technology companies in particular  have experienced significant price fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  historical and anticipated operating results  announcements of new product or service offerings  technological innovations  competitive developments in the public transit industry  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions and trends in the public transit industry  funding initiatives and other legislative developments affecting the transit industry  
table of contents adoption of new accounting standards affecting the technology industry or the public transit industry  and general market and economic conditions and other factors 
further  the stock markets  and particularly the nasdaq small cap market  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies and have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market factors have and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions  interest rate variations  international currency fluctuations  terrorist acts  military actions or war  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our preferred stock and convertible debentures have preferential rights over our common stock 
we currently have outstanding shares of series aaa redeemable nonvoting preferred stock and series e redeemable nonvoting convertible preferred stock  as well as certain eight percent convertible debentures  all of which have rights in preference to holders of our common stock in connection with any liquidation of the company 
the aggregate liquidation preference is million for the series aaa stock and thousand for the series e stock  in each case plus accrued but unpaid dividends  and the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding eight percent percent convertible debentures is thousand 
holders of the series aaa and series e stock are entitled to receive cumulative quarterly dividends at the rate of percent per annum five percent after february  and seven percent percent per annum  respectively  on the liquidation value of those shares 
the purchase agreements  pursuant to which we issued our outstanding eight percent convertible debentures  as well as our domestic senior credit facility  prohibit the payment of dividends to holders of our common stock 
the holders of the debentures have the right to require us to redeem the debentures upon the occurrence of certain events  including certain changes in control of the company or our failure to continue to have our stock listed on the nasdaq stock market or another stock exchange 
in such an event  the holders would have the right to require us to redeem the debentures for an amount equal to the principal amount plus an percent annual yield on the principal amount through the date of redemption  and we might not have the ability to make the required redemption payments 
the preferential rights of the holders of our convertible debentures and preferred stock could substantially limit the amount  if any  that the holders of our common stock would receive upon any liquidation of the company 
risks related to anti takeover provisions our articles of incorporation  bylaws  and north carolina law contain provisions that may make takeovers more difficult or limit the price third parties are willing to pay for our stock 
our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of shares of blank check preferred stock  which would have the designations  rights  and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the board of directors 
accordingly  the board of directors is empowered  without shareholder approval but subject to applicable regulatory restrictions  to issue additional preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock 
our board of directors could also use the issuance of preferred stock  under certain circumstances  as a method of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
although it is currently under reconsideration  our articles of incorporation also provide that our board of directors is divided into three classes  which may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management because less than a majority of the existing directors are up for election at each annual meeting 
in addition  our bylaws require that certain shareholder proposals  including proposals for the nomination of directors  be submitted specified periods in advance of our annual shareholders meetings 
these provisions could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect corporate actions such as a merger  asset sale  or other change of control of the company 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock  and they may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 

table of contents we are also subject to two north carolina statutes that may have anti takeover effects  the north carolina shareholder protection act and the north carolina control share acquisition act 
these statutes could discourage a third party from making a partial tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain a substantial position in our equity securities or seeking to obtain control of us 
they also might limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for our shares of common stock  and they may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control 
risks associated with potential growth we may not be able to obtain the financing we will need to continue to grow 
our business and operating strategy embraces growth 
that includes internal  organic as well as external  acquisition oriented growth scenarios 
this requires that we maintain a high degree of emphasis on finding and securing financing sources of various types in both equity and debt categories 
success in these financing requirements can be adversely impacted by economic conditions and other factors beyond our control 
although we believe that our revolving credit facilities and cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our current business operations at least through the end of  we cannot assure you that we will not require additional sources of financing to fund our operations 
any significant acquisition or other growth initiative would also require additional financing 
additional financing may not be available to us on terms we consider acceptable  if it is available at all 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop next generation products  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business 
further  if we issue equity securities  the new equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
there are many risks associated with potential acquisitions 
we intend to continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that we believe will enhance our existing business or enable us to grow 
if we acquire other companies or product lines in the future  it may dilute the value of existing shareholders ownership 
the impact of dilution may restrict our ability to consummate further acquisitions 
issuance of equity securities in connection with an acquisition may restrict utilization of net operating loss carryforwards because of an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations under the internal revenue code 
we may also incur debt and losses related to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets if we acquire another company  and this could negatively affect our results of operations 
we currently do not have any definitive agreements to acquire any company or business  and we may not be able to identify or complete any acquisition in the future 
additional risks associated with acquisitions include the following it may be difficult to assimilate the operations and personnel of an acquired business into our own business  management information and accounting systems of an acquired business must be integrated into our current systems  our management must devote its attention to assimilating the acquired business  which diverts attention from other business concerns  we may enter markets in which we have limited prior experience  and we may lose key employees of an acquired business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain risks arising from transactions in the normal course of our business and from debt instruments 
such risk is principally associated with interest rate and foreign currency exchange fluctuations  as explained below 

table of contents interest rate risk we utilize both long term fixed rate and short term variable rate borrowings to finance the working capital and capital requirements of our business 
we utilize variable rate debt through a revolving credit facility to support working capital needs 
borrowings bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus percent 
if the bank s prime rate on december   increased by basis points on that date and then remained constant at the higher rate throughout  our interest costs on our outstanding variable rate borrowings at december  of million would increase by approximately thousand for the year ending december  similarly  if the bank s prime rate on december  decreased by basis points on that date and then remained constant at the lower rate throughout  our interest costs on our outstanding variable rate borrowings at december   of million would decrease by approximately thousand for the year ending december  the company currently does not use derivative instruments to manage its interest rate risk 
at december   we had outstanding long term fixed rate borrowings including current portions of million 
we believe the carrying amount of our fixed rate borrowings approximates the estimated fair value for debt with similar terms  interest rates  and remaining maturities currently available to companies with similar credit ratings at december  we do not expect changes in the fair value of our long term fixed rate borrowings to have a significant effect upon our operations  cash flow  or financial position 
the table below provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  consisting solely of debt obligations 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the information is presented in us dollar equivalents  which is the company s reporting currency 
the instruments actual cash flows are denominated in either us dollars us or swedish krona sek  as indicated in parentheses 
expected maturity date liabilities thereafter total in thousands long term debt fixed rate us average interest rate fixed rate sek average interest rate foreign currency exchange rate risk our international subsidiaries operate in europe particularly the nordic countries  south america  and australia and use local currencies as the functional currency and the us dollar as the reporting currency 
though exceptions are made  transactions between the company and the international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the international subsidiaries functional currency 
approximately percent of our sales are denominated in international currencies 
as a result  we have certain exposures to foreign currency risk 
however  management believes that such exposure does not present a significant long term risk due to the relative stability of the european and nordic countries and australia 
risk in south america is mitigated due to those sales representing only approximately percent of our consolidated sales 
our international operations represent a substantial portion of our overall operating results and asset base 
our identifiable foreign currency exchange rate exposures result primarily from accounts receivable from customer sales  anticipated purchases of product from third party suppliers  and the repayment of intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies 
the company primarily manages its foreign currency risk by making use of naturally offsetting positions 
these natural hedges are accomplished  for example  by using local manufacturing facilities that conduct business in local currency and the use of borrowings denominated in local currencies 

table of contents transaction gains and losses on us dollar denominated transactions are recorded within other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations and the net gain totaled thousand and thousand in and  respectively 
the gain primarily was due to the increase in value in the swedish krona sek from a december  rate of sek per us dollar to a december  rate of sek per us dollar  and from a december  rate of sek per us dollar to a december  rate of sek per us dollar
